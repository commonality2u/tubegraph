[[role_of_digital_advancements_in_public_sector_innovation | Digital advancements]] and tools for communication play a crucial role in [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation in government]] and the evolution of public services. These tools are often central to enhancement-oriented innovation, aiming to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and public value.

## The Role of Digitalization
Digitalization is a key driver for changes in public sector productivity and has significantly influenced areas like specialization and capital intensity [01:51:08]. [[digital_transformation_of_public_services | Digitalization projects]] in the public sector, often starting with small upgrades like [[digitalization_of_government_services | digital identity]], can lead to fundamental effects on efficiency, effectiveness, and the introduction of new types of services and innovations [01:10:30]. Most [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | digital transformation]] cases analyzed by the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) are based on enhancement-oriented innovation, focusing on upgrading practices and achieving better results [01:13:02].

## Examples of Digital Tools in Practice

### Austrian Tax Administration: Finance Online
The Austrian tax administration has continuously developed its services over a very long term, with the "Finance Online" system being a prime example of its recent digital steps [00:00:53].

*   **Evolution** The "Finance Online" platform began in 1998 with limited functionality for tax advisors and accountants, gradually expanding to all taxpayers in Austria by 2003 [01:35:10]. Major user interface updates occurred in 2005 and 2018, with a significant relaunch in 2020 that shifted the approach to focus on the user experience [01:35:33].
*   **User-Centric Design** The 2020 relaunch prioritized the user, moving away from a complex, legalistic approach. A persona, "Manfred," was created to understand the average taxpayer's challenges, guiding the development process from tax assessment to receiving refunds [01:37:08].
*   **Key Features and Goals**
    *   **Mobility** A responsive application and mobile versions were developed, acknowledging that younger users primarily access online services via smartphones [01:37:26].
    *   **Multimedia Content** The platform integrates videos and chats, making it more interactive [01:37:45].
    *   **Push Notifications** Users can register for push emails on specific events related to their tax returns [01:37:51].
    *   **Integration** Finance Online is deeply integrated into the broader tax IT landscape, serving as the main interface for input and output of information, with calculations handled by backend systems [01:38:05].
    *   **Reduced Physical Contact** A primary goal was to decrease physical interactions at tax offices and increase the online usage quota [01:38:58].
    *   **Error Reduction & Speed** The new assistant for tax returns asks simple yes/no questions, displaying only relevant input fields to reduce user errors and speed up processing for both users and employees [01:41:54].
    *   **Increased Popularity** The aim was to make Finance Online more popular by adopting user experience principles seen in popular consumer platforms like Google, Amazon, and Facebook [01:39:20].
*   **Development Process** The relaunch involved an idea competition via a crowdsourcing platform (e3 lab), workshops with users and experts, and continuous user involvement through pilots and prototypes [01:39:29].

### Austrian Tax Administration: Chatbot "Fred"
The "Fred" chatbot was introduced to reduce phone calls and face-to-face contacts with the tax office [01:42:43].

*   **Rapid Adoption** Launched softly in September 2019 with one topic, "Fred" quickly gained positive feedback and high usage without advertising [01:43:05]. It now covers nine topics [01:43:15].
*   **Efficiency** In less than 5% of cases, users request human contact via live chat [01:43:25].
*   **Continuous Improvement** An editorial team of 25 civil servants spends hours weekly training the bot to improve its answers [01:43:50].
*   **Future Development** Plans include linking "Fred" with Finance Online for personalized information, enabling simple form filling, and fostering cooperation with other public administration bots to enhance collective intelligence [01:44:08].

### City of Vienna: Digital Communication and Services
Vienna has embraced [[role_of_digitalization_and_social_media_in_public_services | digitalization]] to enhance citizen interaction.

*   **Virtual Government Websites** During the pandemic, well-known and often-used features like virtual government websites provided timely information and guidance to citizens and staff [01:21:10]. These websites are available in different languages [01:21:20].
*   **Vienna Bot** The city uses a "Vienna bot," a machine-man communication device allowing citizens to text or talk inquiries via smartphone and receive quick, often locally-flavored, answers [01:21:28].
*   **Information Provision** The city provides various digital information features, including short video clips for children explaining crisis situations and continually updated information for employees [01:22:26].
*   **Smart City Vienna** This initiative focuses on continuous development for citizens across environmental, economic, and technical aspects, linking to UN Sustainable Development Goals and encouraging citizen participation and support [01:27:54]. Information is provided on how citizens can join and support these efforts [01:28:22].

## Broader Digital Trends and Challenges

*   **Telemedicine** Despite efficiency and effectiveness gains being known for over 20 years, widespread adoption of telemedicine only occurred rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic [01:42:37]. This highlights that technology itself is not always the biggest barrier; a supportive policy environment and governance structures are crucial [01:51:08].
*   **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** A current wave of RPA is sweeping through national governments and is expected to reach state and local levels, increasing capital intensity in the public sector [01:03:31].
*   **Smartphone Usage** While 90% of people have smartphones, there is a lag in public services leveraging this, such as the absence of video smartphone contact for emergency services [01:03:34].
*   **Data and Inclusion** [[role_and_management_of_data_in_digital_public_services | Data governance]] and managing large databases are critical considerations. The [[digital_transformation_and_inclusion_in_government_services | digital divide]] remains a significant concern, as digitizing services risks exacerbating existing inequalities if not designed inclusively [01:51:26].
*   **Legacy Technologies** Public services face challenges in transitioning away from outdated "zombie technologies" and remaining relevant in a rapidly changing technological landscape [01:52:08].

## Fostering Digital Innovation

*   **Comparative Competition** One approach to encourage adoption of digital solutions is to create a "comparative competition" between digital and non-digital alternatives, allowing citizens to choose and observe which gains popularity [01:01:17].
*   **Overcoming Biases** To foster digital innovation, it's important to address human biases such as:
    *   **Subtraction Bias** The tendency to add elements to a system rather than considering subtracting or simplifying existing ones [01:05:25].
    *   **Status Quo Bias** The difficulty in challenging an existing service once it is established, even if it's no longer optimal [01:06:20].
*   **Learning from Failure** A crucial but challenging aspect is sharing what *didn't* work in experiments (e.g., 40% of interventions at Beta don't work), as this transparency can be immensely useful for others [01:50:23].
*   **Mindset and Culture** Overcoming narratives like "we've always done it this way" and fostering an open, participatory, and constantly developing mindset within administration and civil society are essential for adopting digital tools and change [01:46:10], [01:18:18].
*   **Stakeholder Alignment** Ensuring that innovation initiatives, especially those involving digital tools, are well-aligned with end-users and decision-makers is vital for successful implementation and scaling [01:49:42].
*   **Education** Educating public managers and civil servants to instill a mindset of continuous improvement is crucial for driving digital innovation [01:08:58].

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) initiated an Innovation Incubator program to support [[public_sector_digital_transformation | public sector digital transformation]] by fostering cross-border collaboration among governments facing similar innovation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This program is designed as an experimental approach, offering a safe space for exchanging ideas and learning in a protected environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## The Innovation Incubator: An Overview

The Innovation Incubator brings value to projects and creates a safe space for teams to work across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. It's also an opportunity for collective learning and improvement by accumulating shared knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. The incubation process itself is an experimental initiative, which has proven positive and beneficial for participating countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

A global exploration of 88 existing incubators and accelerators for the public sector highlighted that the public sector has its own specificities, with different roles compared to the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Two key takeaways emerged:
*   International borders still hinder collaboration between governments, suggesting room for improvement in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   There's a well-identified need to strengthen cross-border collaboration through a shared platform, not only because challenges are transversal but also because similar challenges can benefit from shared tools, learnings, and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

Based on these findings, the program aims to transform cross-border blind spots into "sweet spots" by focusing on obstacles to government collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This led to the development of a government-to-government (G2G) Innovation Incubator model that promotes cross-border collaboration among governments sharing similar innovation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

### Program Value Proposition
The program's value proposition includes:
*   **Peer Learning Process:** Facilitating learning among participating teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
*   **Expert Insights:** Bringing on board experts to nurture the learning process with their insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
*   **Recognition and Visibility:** Providing well-deserved recognition and visibility to government teams making significant efforts to produce successful and impactful initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term Support:** Aiming to be a long-term support process, focusing on weaving close relationships and building trust between teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

The process began in December 2023, utilizing iteration loops to generate knowledge and continuously improve the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

## Innovation Challenges and Solutions

The program identified four initial challenges from 72 submissions across 25 different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>:

## Cohort-Based Learning Track

Given the high demand, a parallel cohort-based learning track was created, offering 30 government teams worldwide an opportunity to collaborate on specific innovation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01:00">[01:07:01:00]</a>. This track features five thematic sessions on topics like open experimentation, cultural [[public_sector_challenges_and_transformations | transformation]], citizen involvement, evidence-based policymaking, and scaling public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27:00">[01:07:27:00]</a>.

Innovation in public services is a critical agenda in today's world, drawing participation from diverse professionals and government representatives across various time zones and backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. A panel of policymakers and experts from Brazil, Canada, Portugal, and the European Commission convened to discuss this important topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Why [[Innovation in public services | Innovation in Public Services]] is Central

The OECD strongly advocates for this agenda, believing it is central, particularly in the current global context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. A report on global trends of government [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]], focused on public services, highlights the need to "put the public back into public services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. [[Innovation_in_public_services | Innovation in public services]] is no longer optional; it is essential to address complex challenges such as inequality, climate change, and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Key Objectives of Public Service Innovation

Governments pursue several objectives when innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>:
*   **Improving Efficiency and Effectiveness**: Enhancing the delivery of public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Increasing Public Satisfaction**: Boosting citizen contentment with services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Enhancing Service Uptake**: Especially for populations facing challenges in accessing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Fairness and Equal Treatment**: Strengthening the relationship between governments and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Building Trust**: Improving citizens' trust in governments through quality and inclusive service provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Strategic and Human-Centric Approaches

There is a global trend towards a more strategic and consistent approach to support [[innovation_in_public_services | innovation in public services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This approach places the human element and people at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. It requires a cultural shift in bureaucracy to ensure citizens are central to service design, particularly during important life events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The OECD promotes recommendations on human-centric public administrative services, focusing on best practices to refocus efforts on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## The Role of Digital Transformation and AI

Digital transformation and the emergence of artificial intelligence are significantly changing the rules of the game for public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. These technologies offer immense opportunities for more responsive, personalized, and proactive public services if managed responsibly and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Digital [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] is an important factor in these advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

However, digitalization alone is not sufficient; a bad analog process will result in a bad digital process if nothing else changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. Digital government should be viewed as a continuous change process, driven by technologies but requiring system thinking and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Data-driven public administrations focus on working with data rather than through documents, enabling seamless data flow between administrative layers and across countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This requires high-quality, exchangeable data that is technically, legally, and semantically harmonized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

*   **Old Age Benefits Transformation**: A major modernization effort involves replacing multi-decade-old technology platforms for old age benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. An immediate benefit is reducing errors, which in the real world means preventing loss of essential financial support or overpayments that create financial pressure on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.
*   **Digital Infrastructure & Literacy**: Recognizing unequal service access across the large country, Canada is building digital infrastructure to ensure all citizens, regardless of location, can access services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This is coupled with promoting digital literacy, adapting program language and interface quality for ease of use across various devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.
*   **Life Events and Life Journeys View**: Shifting from a product-based view to designing service interfaces from the client's perspective, bundling services around life events (e.g., death in the family, welcoming a child, retirement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. Future plans include greater integration to reduce repeated information provision, aligning with the "tell us once" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.

## [[Challenges and strategies for innovative public services | Challenges and Recommendations]]

Innovation, while challenging, is possible with courage, collaboration, and a clear vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>. Key advice for decision-makers and public servants:

*   **Put People at the Center**: This is absolutely essential for every decision, from digital transformation to public procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.
*   **Build a Culture of Experimentation**: [[Innovation in public sector management | Innovation]] thrives in environments that foster learning and trust, where people feel safe to share ideas and challenge existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. Brazil's K_Collabora program, which centralizes personal management, procurement, and budget execution for multiple ministries, exemplifies this, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.
*   **Invest in Public Servants**: They are the backbone of any innovation effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>. Brazil's unified government hiring process, which reached 1.5 million candidates in its first edition and decentralized exams to include candidates from all municipalities, attracts top talent and democratizes access to civil service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Foster Collaboration Across Sectors and Borders**: Global challenges require global solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>. Programs like Brazil's "Contratamize Brazil" (a procurement program inspired by local projects to reduce bureaucracy and include small and medium-sized companies) demonstrate successful scaling of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. Platforms for sharing knowledge and best practices are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.
*   **Rethink Efficiency**: Efficiency should not solely focus on cost savings but also on improving the quality and timeliness of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. It should consider how products reach clients and integrate into their lives, addressing "sludge" (unnecessary burdens) and pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.
*   **Innovation is Not Always New**: Sometimes, [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] involves revisiting and enhancing existing, forgotten systems with new technologies or processes. For example, using modern technology to put proactive involvement in benefit programs "on steroids" to automatically enroll more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>.

## [[Building effective innovation communities in public services | Building Effective Innovation Communities]]

A community on [[innovation_in_public_services | innovation in public services]] is being built, co-chaired by Portugal and Brazil, gathering 22 countries plus the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. This working group aims to exchange learnings, maintain momentum in purposeful innovation, and ensure generated impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.

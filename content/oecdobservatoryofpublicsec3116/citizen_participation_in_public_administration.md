[[Citizencentered governance and engagement | Citizen-centered governance]] and engagement are crucial for modern public administration, fostering resilience, trust, and inclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:46">02:30:46</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">03:58:00</a>. This involves actively listening to the voices of citizens and those within organizations who are closest to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">10:53:00</a>.

## Key Principles and Approaches

Governments must support more proactive [[citizen_participation_in_technology_governance | citizen participation]] and inclusion efforts, demonstrating openness to change in response to public needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">11:25:00</a>.

### Human Rights-Based Approach
In Portugal, the public administration is working to adopt a human rights-based approach in the design, delivery, and evaluation of its public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">06:51:00</a>.

### Embedding Participation
[[Democratic innovations and citizen engagement | Public innovation]] systems naturally embed [[civic_participation_challenges | civic participation]] and the principles of open administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">06:22:00</a>. Many countries, including Portugal, are involved in the Open Government Partnership and other groups that drive participatory initiatives in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">06:32:00</a>.

## Portuguese Initiatives

The Portuguese Administrative Modernization Agency (AMA) aims to improve daily life for people through better public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">01:14:00</a>, contributing to [[innovative_public_administration_practices | innovation in public services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">00:34:00</a>.

### LabX
LabX, the laboratory for experimentation in [[public_administration_transformation | public administration]], plays a significant role in bringing [[civic_participation_challenges | civic participation]] to the forefront of public administration work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">07:04:00</a>. It acts as a safe space to research, co-create, and experiment with innovative solutions, centering them around the real needs and expectations of citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">01:10:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">05:04:00</a>. Since 2017, LabX has worked on over 30 projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">05:16:00</a>.

Examples of LabX's work:
*   **Citizen Shops**: To improve these "one-stop shops" that began in the late 1990s, LabX conducted extensive fieldwork including 800 on-site surveys with citizens and frontline civil servants, observations, and co-creation workshops. Prototypes were tested in "living labs" where people experimented with new solutions and provided feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">05:10:00</a>.
*   **Tax Authority Engagement**: LabX conducted ethnographic work, in-depth interviews, and digital surveys with over 1,000 participants to understand citizen feelings and improve communication and interaction with the tax authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">05:40:00</a>.
*   **Education for Citizenship**: Originally asked to develop an app to teach children about citizenship, LabX instead developed a card game to understand children's concerns and how they wanted to engage. This game evolved into a tool for citizenship development, distributed to over 300 schools and leading to about 30 local engagement projects where children involved their families in community clean-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">05:56:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">05:56:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">01:00:10</a>. This highlights that innovation is not always about technology; sometimes, it's a simple piece of paper that solves problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">00:59:09</a>.
*   **Listening to Civil Servants**: LabX develops methodologies to listen to frontline civil servants, recognizing they know the reality of citizens best and have strong insights into how to deliver better services. This includes adapting participation games, using Lego Serious Play, and card sorting workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">01:00:20</a>.
*   **Youth Engagement (Project 18)**: This project aimed to understand the best way to provide public services to young people and redesign their digital experience. Findings revealed that young people make little use of public online services despite being digital natives, often feeling lost and preferring face-to-face interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">01:01:47</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">01:02:18</a>. They also found it difficult to engage in [[civic_participation_challenges | citizen participation]], not knowing how to benefit or their responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">01:02:19</a>. Key recommendations included using plain, adapted language, providing performance support to navigate services, and establishing a single point of contact for relevant services, along with more advertising to raise awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">01:04:30</a>. A prototype of this dedicated platform is being developed and tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">01:08:26</a>.

### Simplex Program
Simplex is Portugal's innovation and modernization flagship program, active for 15 years. It served as a privileged tool for adaptive response during the 2020 pandemic, releasing about 200 measures in a few weeks. This success was based on broad interaction with citizens, companies, and civil society, involving all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">07:22:00</a>.

## US Initiatives

The 10x program within the US General Services Administration (GSA) aims to improve the public's experience with the US government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">01:13:38</a>. It takes a venture capital mindset, soliciting ideas from government employees—who are seen as hands-on practitioners dealing with daily problems—and transforming them into good-for-government products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">01:13:25</a>.

Key aspects of 10x:
*   **Bottom-Up Approach**: Actively asks federal employees what problems they want to solve, recognizing that good ideas can come from anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">01:14:43</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">01:27:47</a>.
*   **Targeting Broad Impact**: Funds projects that benefit multiple agencies or impact a large segment of the public's interaction with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">01:17:32</a>.
*   **Focus on Public Trust and Civic Life**: Actively seeks technology projects sourced from employees that can rebuild public trust and foster [[citizen_participation_in_technology_governance | public engagement]] in rulemaking and policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">01:28:16</a>. This includes helping citizens find government information more easily and ensuring the citizen voice is heard in service design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">01:28:40</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

While the focus on [[citizen_participation_in_technology_governance | citizen participation]] is strong, [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_administration | challenges]] remain:
*   **Measuring Impact**: Evaluating new, emergent adaptive innovations is difficult without a baseline. New evaluation methods, such as outcome harvesting and contribution analysis, are needed to match the nature of adaptive innovation and focus on shared outcomes with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">02:24:00</a>.
*   **Maintaining Trust**: Prolonged crises, shifting measures, and misinformation can weaken public trust in governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:03">01:45:03</a>. The "infodemic" of disinformation poses an ongoing struggle to debunk false information and uphold trust in democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:46">01:48:46</a>.
*   **Balancing Efficiency and Values**: Unlike the private sector, governments must balance efficiency with democratic values like transparency, accountability, and safeguarding the common good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:54">01:52:54</a>. This includes ensuring total coverage for all citizens, including those in remote or socially disadvantaged groups, which may not be profitable for the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:03">01:53:03</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:21">01:53:21</a>.
*   **Digital Divide and Accessibility**: While digital services offer efficiency, access to high-speed broadband or services like car sharing and food delivery often disproportionately benefits privileged, densely populated areas, leaving remote or impoverished areas behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">01:52:16</a>. Governments must address these divides to ensure equitable service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">01:29:07</a>.
*   **Culture Change**: Shifting mindsets of all stakeholders—government, companies, and citizens—is crucial for sustainable change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">01:31:56</a>.
*   **Cost of Inaction**: It is important to quantify the "cost of not doing something"—the economic and trust implications of citizens being frustrated with services or unable to access them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">02:14:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:52">02:17:52</a>. This includes the wider societal benefits and externalities that public sector innovation can provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">02:16:00</a>.
*   **Avoiding Overconfidence**: Adaptive approaches should involve nimble experimentation, recognizing uncertainty and complexity, rather than overreacting or becoming overconfident in initial responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:42">02:08:42</a>.

[[public_sector_innovation | Public sector innovation]] and [[collaboration_and_innovation_in_public_sector | collaboration and innovation in the public sector]] are crucial in a world of continuous change and complex global issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Governments are increasingly looking beyond their borders to develop solutions to global challenges, such as ending pandemics, addressing migration, and reducing carbon dependency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The key question is how governments can improve their ability to innovate together for the public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Need for Cross-Border Government Innovation

The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated digital transformation and the pace and scale of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It has also exposed shortcomings and pre-existing vulnerabilities at the national level, highlighting a lack of preparedness among governments to tackle global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and disruptions in global value chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. While [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] has become a key tool to collectively address pressing challenges, government innovation efforts are largely confined to national and local borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This raises the question of why [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaboration]] at the global level is not happening more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Initiatives and Reports on Cross-Border Innovation

The OECD Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation have partnered to determine how governments can best support cross-border [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Their joint work includes extensive research, a global call for innovation, and open global workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Achieving Cross-Border Government Innovation Reports

The first report in a series, "Achieving Cross-Border Government Innovation," was launched, highlighting that issues facing governments are increasingly complex and trans-boundary, requiring existing governance mechanisms for international cooperation to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It shows how governments leverage new governance structures, including innovative governance bodies, horizontal networks, and coordinated systems approaches, to tackle cross-border issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This first report focused on "top-down governance" or horizontal networks, covering new types of governance bodies, transnational connections, ground-up horizontal networks, and innovative systems dynamics like co-governance and co-funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

The second report, "Surfacing Insights and Experimenting Across Borders," focuses on more ground-up approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. It emphasizes that experimentation has emerged as a key mode of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] in government, making ideas more realistic solutions that can be tested for implementation and risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The success of experimentation within countries has led governments to apply similar approaches in cross-border and global contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Examples of Cross-Border Innovation

### Surfacing Insights and Collective Intelligence
The second report features approaches for surfacing insights and collective intelligence, such as challenge initiatives, crowdsourcing exercises, and democratic citizens' assemblies, scaled to a transnational level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

*   **Deep Space Food Challenge:** An international [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaboration]] between the Canadian Space Agency and NASA, incentivizing innovation in food production technologies for space exploration and terrestrial needs like reducing food insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This challenge involves parallel prize competitions by each government, synchronized in marketing and outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.
*   **Global Innovation Collaborative:** A network and platform for [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaborations]] through which city governments (e.g., Paris, London, New York, Berlin) launch open innovation competitions and invite innovators to deploy solutions in local testbeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This leads to more resilient and sustainable cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. A specific example is the "creative cities challenge" focused on the creative and cultural sector during lockdowns, using technology and digital platforms to aid recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

### Experimenting and Testing Across Borders
The report also covers testing new ideas and scaling them in a cross-border manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

*   **5G Corridors (5G Mobix):** A case study stretching across the EU, into China and Turkey, testing automated vehicles in different environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **UAE Government Accelerators Program:** A methodology that takes [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] from ideation to accelerated execution within 100 days or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>. It emphasizes empowering frontline employees, stakeholder building, and [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaborative]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>. The focus is on piloting solutions, then sustaining and scaling them to different geographical areas or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.
    *   **UAE Moonshot Apprenticeship Program:** Launched in June 2021, uniting young minds, talents, and governments to tackle pressing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. It pairs UAE nationals with international counterparts to develop "moonshot projects" in priority sectors like the data economy, global talent, and global outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:03">[01:19:03]</a>.
    *   **Moonshot Pilot Grant:** An outcome of the apprenticeship program, a call for the international community to test groundbreaking ideas in partnership with the UAE, with funding up to $100,000 per project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.
*   **Agile Nations Network:** The UAE joined six other nations to foster global [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | cooperation]] on rulemaking in response to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:48">[02:00:48]</a>.

## Challenges and Success Factors in Cross-Border Innovation

### Key Challenges
*   **Cultural norms and values:** Different cultural norms and respecting various norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>, including the lack of feedback mechanisms and learning loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
*   **Undeveloped ecosystems:** A significant barrier, making it difficult to understand the cost and benefits of cross-border partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   **Scaling of experiments:** Considering scalability in the design process and how success can be applied to other contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

### Key Success Factors
*   **Culture of openness and innovation:** Essential for successful projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.
*   **Agility and adaptability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.
*   **Understanding and engaging diverse ecosystems and stakeholders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.
*   **Clearly defining roles and responsibilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

*   **Developing formal mechanisms:** Implementing sandboxes, testbeds, and other structures to enable [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:04">[02:29:04]</a>.

## The Role of Ecosystems and Collective Intelligence

[[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] can often feel like a "handmade in combat" process, with project managers needing to negotiate with various departments without sufficient support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. Reducing barriers to [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and scaling [[public_sector_innovation_methods_and_strategies | innovation approaches]] within government is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. This involves addressing key elements:
*   **Legal and policy frameworks:** Recognizing that laws can be changed to enable [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], as seen in the US with prize competitions and citizen science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.
*   **Shared infrastructure and common platforms:** Platforms like challenge.gov or data.gov provide a low-cost starting point and a one-stop shop for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>.
*   **Communities of practice:** Supporting and connecting people who want to learn at various stages of the process, such as the UAE's train-the-trainer methodologies for building innovation capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.
*   **Budgeting for success:** Allocating resources assuming a pilot will succeed, to avoid delays in scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.
*   **Addressing agency processes and reporting requirements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.
*   **External assessments and impact studies:** Adopting an evaluation mindset, even if results are not always positive, to learn and improve future impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.

### Harnessing Collective Intelligence
The most creative ideas often come from outside an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>. [[collaboration_and_innovation_in_public_sector | Collaborative approaches in public sector innovation]] should focus on harvesting knowledge from anywhere using methods like open innovation platforms, collective intelligence platforms, and networks linking diverse communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. The second aspect of collective intelligence is what is done with the knowledge gained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. In science and medicine, discoveries are systematically documented, shared, and embedded in training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. The task for the future is to use the internet and data capabilities to organize collective intelligence and make it a standard part of government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. These approaches are inherently cross-border, mobilizing intelligence wherever it can be found and orchestrating it to be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:44">[00:55:44]</a>.

Ecosystems can be thought of both vertically (mission-focused, e.g., climate change entities) and horizontally (method-focused, e.g., communities of practice around prize competitions or citizen science) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>. NASA's International Space Apps Challenge, a hackathon engaging 28,000 people from 162 countries, exemplifies horizontal ecosystem building by providing data, software, and tools for innovators to solve challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

## Institutionalization and Scaling

To move beyond initial pilots and ideas, learnings must be implemented and integrated into existing or new processes and structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. This requires institutionalization, making [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] a stable part of someone's job and ensuring consistent funding streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.
For example, the creation of GAVI 20 years ago institutionalized global [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaboration]] on vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>. Similar institutional building is needed for critical areas like net-zero emissions, education, health, and poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>.

### The UAE Approach to Scaling
The UAE government's approach to scaling involves setting a 100-day cap for piloting innovative solutions, focusing on empowering frontline employees and fostering [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaborative]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Towards the end of the 100 days, the focus shifts to setting up a sustainability team and a strategy for scaling the proven solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.

### London's Collaborative Model
London's approach to [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaboration]] involves creating the London Office of Technology and Innovation (LOTI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>. This organization consciously engages authorities that ascribe to specific principles, particularly embedding agile methodology in municipal government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>. This creates a cultural "bar" that, when met, integrates groups into a beneficial, motivational movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The future of [[collaboration_and_innovation_in_public_sector | collaboration and innovation in the public sector]] is driven by the inherent cross-border nature of today's largest challenges, such as climate change, food security, and water security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>. Despite procedural and cultural difficulties, governments will increasingly need to develop strong partnerships, trust, and open [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaborative]] relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:47">[01:25:47]</a>.

There is a growing need to institutionalize innovation, moving beyond ad-hoc projects to systematic integration into policy-making and procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>. This may lead to "mini-lateralism" – flexible groupings of similar cities or nations working on shared problems, distinct from more standardized multilateral bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:46">[01:26:46]</a>. The sharing of foundational standards, data approaches, and shared methodologies for design and convening will have a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>.

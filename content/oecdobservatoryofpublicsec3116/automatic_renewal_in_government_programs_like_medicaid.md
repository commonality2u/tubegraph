This article explores the concept of administrative burden in government services and the push towards automatic renewal, particularly within programs like Medicaid in the United States. It details the challenges posed by manual processes, the strategic efforts to implement automated solutions, and the observed impacts on access, equality, and public trust.

## What is Administrative Burden?
Administrative burdens refer to the negative interactions and "frictions" individuals experience when engaging with government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:44">[03:07:44]</a>. These burdens are categorized into three types of costs:
*   **Learning Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:06">[04:27:06]</a>: The effort required to find information about public services and determine eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:26">[04:30:26]</a>. An example is navigating the complex choices within the US Medicare system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:08">[05:13:08]</a>.
*   **Compliance Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:59">[06:09:59]</a>: The time, effort, and resources spent following rules and requirements, such as paperwork, waiting in line, paying fees, and providing documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:08">[06:12:08]</a>. This is often what people imagine when thinking of "red tape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:26">[06:14:26]</a>.
*   **Psychological Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:07">[08:31:07]</a>: The stress, loss of autonomy, frustration, and even fear experienced when navigating public processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:43">[09:23:43]</a>. While stigma is a known factor, the framework broadens this to include broader psychological impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:16">[08:59:16]</a>. These costs can significantly affect public trust in [[building_resilient_and_adaptive_government_systems | government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:10">[09:39:10]</a>.

Small administrative burdens can have significant impacts, as shown by a study on a student loan forgiveness program where simply pre-filling a form increased application rates from 24% to 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:21">[13:01:21]</a>. These burdens also exacerbate inequality, disproportionately affecting those who most need help but have the fewest resources to navigate complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:07">[13:39:07]</a>.

## The Problem of Manual Renewals: The Medicaid Example
In the US, Medicaid is a primary health insurance program for low-income individuals, covering one in two children at some point in their childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:39">[07:05:39]</a>. However, it requires annual re-eligibility proof, leading to significant compliance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:26">[07:27:26]</a>. This process is complicated and cumbersome, often resulting in "churn," where people lose coverage for procedural reasons only to re-enroll a month or two later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:09">[07:50:09]</a>. This also highlights [[seamless_government_practices_and_challenges | seamless government practices and challenges]] that exist.

## The Push for Automatic Renewal
The most effective way to reduce administrative burdens and increase participation in public programs is through automatic renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. This approach shifts the burden of proof from individuals to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:01">[16:17:01]</a>.

### Biden Administration Initiatives
The Biden Administration has prioritized reducing burdens in government services. Key actions include:
*   **Executive Orders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>: Signing orders on racial equity and a comprehensive customer experience order in December 2021, linking burden reduction to improving service quality and public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:14">[17:53:14]</a>.
*   **Guidance to Agencies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:25">[18:22:25]</a>: Providing instructions on how to measure and reduce administrative burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:43">[18:29:43]</a>.
*   **New Tools and Practices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:07">[18:42:07]</a>: Introducing human-centered design as a policy tool for reviewing and designing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:23">[18:50:23]</a>.
*   **Repurposing Existing Processes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:04">[19:22:04]</a>: Requiring agencies to incorporate customer experience and burden reduction into mandatory reporting and budget preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:04">[19:34:04]</a>. The Paperwork Reduction Act was reinterpreted to include learning, compliance, and psychological costs beyond just form-filling time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:07">[19:48:07]</a>.

Following the pandemic, the Biden Administration urged state governments to expand "ex parte" or automatic renewal in Medicaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:40">[21:21:40]</a>. Existing law allows states to automatically renew eligibility if they have the necessary data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:30">[21:42:30]</a>. To encourage this, waivers and flexibilities were offered to states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:16:32">[22:16:32]</a>.

## Evidence of Success
### National Level
Between 2023 and 2024, the national average for automatic Medicaid renewals significantly increased from one in four people to almost one in two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:17">[22:30:17]</a>. This has reduced the need for millions of people to fill out paperwork, saving time, reducing burdens, and preventing coverage loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:07">[22:56:07]</a>.

### State-Level (Minnesota Medicaid)
In Minnesota, a project with Code for America (a non-profit Civic Tech firm) focused on expanding automatic renewal for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled population, who are often vulnerable and struggle with paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:50">[23:17:50]</a>. Code for America helped the state organize and connect administrative data from various sources to simplify eligibility verification for caseworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:14">[24:06:14]</a>. This intervention dramatically increased automatic renewals for this population from approximately 40% to nearly 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:09">[24:50:09]</a>.

Furthermore, this expansion of automatic renewal helped reduce inequalities. Before the intervention, non-white families, especially Black families, had lower-than-average enrollment in Medicaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:05">[25:29:05]</a>. After the change, their enrollment rates became comparable to other families, suggesting that automatic renewal helps "level the playing field" by removing hurdles for disadvantaged families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:11">[25:50:11]</a>.

### National Government Intervention (US Digital Service)
The US Digital Service (USDS), a civic tech organization working within [[building_resilient_and_adaptive_government_systems | government]], deployed "tiger teams" to several states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:50">[26:16:50]</a>. For about a week, USDS experts met daily with state counterparts to identify ways to improve services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:06">[26:47:06]</a>. They provided:
*   **Technical Capacity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:24">[27:08:24]</a>: Identifying data sources for eligibility verification and checking code for errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:04">[27:10:04]</a>.
*   **Policy Capacity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:01">[27:26:01]</a>: Informing states about policy flexibilities and ways to maximize opportunities under national policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:43">[27:29:43]</a>.

This intervention helped lower-performing states increase their automatic renewal rates to the national average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>.

## Risks and Considerations of Automation
While automation offers significant benefits, it also carries risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:33:43">[28:33:43]</a>.
*   **Potential for Misuse** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:01">[28:42:01]</a>: The use of algorithms, particularly for fraud detection, can go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:01">[28:42:01]</a>. Cases in Australia and the Netherlands demonstrated how automation focused disproportionately on minimizing fraud rather than maintaining access to benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:02">[29:29:02]</a>.
*   **Bias and Failure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:26">[29:24:26]</a>: Algorithms can introduce bias and generate false positives, leading to the state shifting more burdens back onto clients to prove their eligibility or innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:36:09">[29:36:09]</a>. In the Dutch case, this even led to the downfall of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05:07">[48:05:07]</a>: [[Digitalization of government services | Digitalization of government services]] can increase inequality due to unequal access to technology, particularly for older adults who may struggle with digital interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:20:00">[48:20:00]</a>.
*   **Privacy Concerns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:37:34">[56:37:34]</a>: Governments must balance the value of increased access through data sharing with privacy concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:16:03">[58:16:03]</a>. Often, government agencies tend to overvalue privacy relative to access, even when citizens are willing to share data for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:50:08">[58:50:08]</a>. The principle of "Do no harm" should guide data sharing to benefit citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

## Key Lessons for Implementing Change
A report commissioned by the US federal government highlighted several key lessons for successful burden reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:16">[30:28:16]</a>:
*   **Build a Public-Centered Culture** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:45:00">[30:45:00]</a>: Focus on the public's experience of administrative processes using tools like human-centered design and journey mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a>.
*   **Develop Capacity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:08:14">[31:08:14]</a>: Agencies that successfully advanced burden reduction often had dedicated customer experience staff whose primary job was to review processes and incorporate public feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:23">[31:18:23]</a>.
*   **Foster Collaboration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:55">[31:33:55]</a>: Redesigning processes frequently requires multiple agencies to work together, especially concerning data sharing to simplify eligibility verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:11">[31:36:11]</a>.
*   **Simplify Processes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:32">[31:53:32]</a>: Governments are adept at building new systems but less so at reviewing existing ones to ensure they are "fit for purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:07">[31:56:07]</a>. Regularly evaluating and streamlining processes is crucial. This addresses [[adapting_government_systems_to_modern_needs | adapting government systems to modern needs]] and [[challenges_of_outdated_government_systems | challenges of outdated government systems]].
*   **Leverage Technology Wisely** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:01">[32:25:01]</a>: Technology can be a powerful enabler, especially for leveraging administrative data to shift burdens from the public to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:29:16">[32:29:16]</a>. However, "blind faith" in technology can lead to increased burdens and worse outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:25">[32:37:25]</a>.
*   **Measure Effectively** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:14:04">[34:14:04]</a>: While compliance costs (time, money) are relatively well-measured, assessing learning and psychological costs remains challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:19:08">[34:19:08]</a>. Qualitative methods like focus groups and community outreach are valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:08">[36:05:08]</a>. For people who engage with services, simple, short user surveys are effective, such as text or pop-up surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:07">[39:07:07]</a>. Uncertainty in processes is a significant administrative burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:47:04">[39:47:04]</a>.

## Role of Behavioral Science
Behavioral science brings valuable skills to the table for reducing administrative burdens and supporting [[role_of_adaptive_innovation_in_government_services | adaptive innovation in public services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:00:54">[51:00:54]</a>.
*   **Experimental Design** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:44:03">[51:44:03]</a>: Employing A/B testing or randomized control trials (RCTs) can determine if an intervention is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:44:03">[51:44:03]</a>.
*   **Data Analysis and Reporting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:09:08">[52:09:08]</a>: Behavioral scientists can help systematically analyze data and document findings, even through peer review, which governments often lack resources for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:12:00">[52:12:00]</a>.
*   **Human-Centered Design** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:35:05">[52:35:05]</a>: Familiarizing people with human-centered design and journey mapping can help modernize approaches to government problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:37:37">[52:37:37]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Evaluation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:03:07">[53:03:07]</a>: Behavioral scientists can remind implementers that intuitive solutions may not always work as expected, and robust evaluation is crucial to ensure interventions truly reduce burdens and improve outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:07:54">[53:07:54]</a>.

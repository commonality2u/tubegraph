Building a culture of anticipation and resilience within organizations, particularly governments, involves integrating strategic foresight into core processes and fostering a forward-looking mindset. This approach moves beyond simply predicting the future to enabling better decisions in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.

## What is Strategic Foresight?

Strategic foresight is defined as the ability to constantly perceive, make sense of, and act on the future in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. Its primary purpose is not to foresee the future, but to enable better decision-making today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. This means using [[anticipatory innovation and foresight | strategic foresight]] products, such as forecasting or scenarios, to stress-test current actions and [[anticipatory_innovation | future-proof]] them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>. It is a structured, participatory, inclusive, impactful, and systemic approach to understanding future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>.

While often dealing with medium to long-term futures, strategic foresight's timeframe can shorten in volatile areas like artificial intelligence (where medium-term might be months) or during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, where prediction models were precise for only a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:25">[02:24:25]</a>.

### Benefits of Strategic Foresight

[[anticipatory_innovation | Strategic foresight]] helps organizations by:
*   Setting priorities and steering policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:56">[02:56:56]</a>.
*   Identifying challenges and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:06">[03:04:06]</a>.
*   Informing [[adapting_to_crisis_with_innovative_approaches | innovative solutions]] and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   [[crisis_management_and_future_preparedness | Stress-testing]] current decisions, policies, and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:17">[03:16:17]</a>.
*   Building shared visions and success stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   Going from forecasting to anticipating, enabling better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## Integrating Strategic Foresight in Practice

The OECD works on [[anticipatory_innovation_and_engaging_with_the_future | anticipatory good practice principles]] to build governance systems that allow for effective use of strategic foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This includes engaging with uncertainty, ensuring continuity across policy cycles, and leveraging [[anticipatory_innovation | transformative innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

### Government of Flanders: A Blueprint for Integration

The OECD and the Government of Flanders collaborated for over two years to assess Flanders' strategic foresight system and create a blueprint for embedding it in a multi-level perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

The **Strategic Foresight for Resilience initiative** in Flanders emerged during the COVID-19 crisis, highlighting the need for [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory intelligence]] in volatile and complex times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. [[anticipatory_innovation_and_foresight | Foresight]] inherently involves crossing boundaries:
*   **Time:** Looking at past, present, and long-term future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   **Policy Domains:** Addressing interconnected challenges and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.
*   **Actors:** Collaborating with government, academia, EU institutions, and other initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

The blueprint identifies four key functions for embedding strategic foresight in government:
1.  **Discover:** Engaging in trend and weak signal analysis, requiring dedicated time and skilled personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.
2.  **Explore:** Making sense of insights through tools like Horizon Scanning, patterns, and system analysis, and engaging in science-to-policy dialogues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.
    *   *Example:* In 2022, Flanders collaborated with research funds and Dutch colleagues to bring scientists and policymakers together across five themes to exchange knowledge and identify leverage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.
3.  **Map:** Connecting intelligence with current policymaking by building explorative scenarios, using tools like Futures Wheels, and mapping resilient indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. [[crisis_management_and_future_preparedness | Resilient indicators]] use statistical data to understand future potential, capabilities, and weaknesses, aiding in preparedness for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Flanders collaborated with 10 other European regions to build and explore scenarios for a resilient Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>. These scenarios ("smart optimism," "hyper competition," "silver spheres," "urban flows") were linked with [[toolkit_for_anticipatory_innovation | Horizon Scanning]] using a digital platform to develop anticipatory intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>. Scenario workshops used videos to immerse participants, exploring common challenges and finding solutions through multi-level collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:03]</a>.
4.  **Create:** Focusing on impact and scale by developing visions, roadmaps, and coalitions for the future, especially critical in times of crisis to work on recovery and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>.

#### Enabling Factors and Challenges in Flanders
*   **Clear Expectation Management:** Including principles, activities, and outputs before, during, and after the foresight process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>.
*   **Balanced Internal/External Capacity:** Ensuring internal capacity for designing and collaborating on initiatives, even when working with external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>.
*   **Structural Mandate vs. Project Fragmentation:** A major challenge is moving from project-based initiatives to a more structural mandate for foresight within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>.

### Finland: Integrating Foresight into Everyday Policy Cycles

Finland possesses multiple strategic foresight assets, including a Committee for the Future in Parliament, a strategic foresight team in the Prime Minister's Office, Citra (which produces megatrend reports and facilitates national dialogues for citizen participation), strategy and research units in sectoral ministries, and innovation labs in government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:00">[42:42:00]</a>. They also have extensive networks of foresight and innovation practitioners, and research centers focusing on various types of foresight (e.g., [[role_of_technology_in_anticipatory_innovation | technology foresight]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:01:00">[44:01:00]</a>.

Despite these assets, an OECD assessment identified an "impact gap" in integrating these activities into core government processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a>. To address this, the focus is on embedding [[anticipatory_innovation_and_engaging_with_the_future | anticipation]] into everyday policy cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01:00">[45:01:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Strategic foresight informing politicians and agency CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:10:00">[45:10:00]</a>.
*   Dialogue between foresight specialists, policymakers, civil servants, and decision-makers to inform strategic decision-making and secure mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:21:00">[45:21:21]</a>.
*   Leading to policy coherence, reflected in budgeting decisions, performance management, HR, and ultimately, more impactful and effective [[adapting_to_crisis_with_innovative_approaches | innovation activities]] that create value for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>.

### Estonia: Informing Policymaking through Parliament and Media

The Foresight Center at the Estonian Parliament aims to inform the public and Parliament about alternative scenarios, future risks, and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:14:00">[48:14:00]</a>. Their work plan reflects proposals from Parliament members on topics to be tackled with foresight methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:02:00">[49:02:00]</a>.

Impact on policymaking is achieved when:
*   Parliament members adopt and convey the messages, leading to public debate and input for ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:41:00">[49:41:00]</a>.
*   Ministries are directly involved through steering committees for foresight topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:38:00">[50:38:00]</a>.
*   Media is used proactively to amplify messages, as MPs tend to take insights more seriously when reported by the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:09:00">[51:09:00]</a>.

A key lesson is to combine foresight methods with traditional analysis to provide numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:03:00">[52:03:00]</a>. Using hypothetical simulations and focusing on potential budgetary impact are instrumental hooks to engage Parliament members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:35:00">[52:35:00]</a>.

### Wales: Legislation-Driven Futures and Foresight

Wales has a unique legislative approach to futures and foresight, stemming from the Well-being of Future Generations Act 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:32:00">[56:32:00]</a>. This Act established National well-being goals, legal duties, an independent Future Generations Commissioner, and a duty for Welsh ministers to publish a Future Trends Report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:51:00">[56:51:00]</a>. The "long-term" way of working is considered essential to sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:10:00">[57:10:00]</a>.

Key aspects of the Welsh approach:
*   **Future Trends Report:** Curates foresight products for different audiences (infographics, narrative summaries, evidence packs), recognizing that different people are persuaded by different formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:46:00">[57:46:00]</a>. It uses trends as conversation starters to explore potential implications and question assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:44:00">[58:44:00]</a>.
*   **Integrating Foresight:** Looks for logical entry points within existing systems and processes, such as:
    *   Central part of impact assessment processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:31:00">[59:31:00]</a>.
    *   Included in procurement and grants processes with an appraisal of long-term considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:38:00">[59:38:00]</a>.
    *   Part of corporate learning and development for civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:46:00">[59:46:00]</a>.
    *   Regional place-specific plans address future trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:52:00">[59:52:00]</a>.
    *   A small dedicated team acts as a go-to hub, empowering others to use foresight tools in their policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.
*   **Tangible Changes:** Key government strategies (transport, development, waste, national milestones) are increasingly developed with a longer-term lens (2040-2050 horizon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>.
*   **Harnessing Networks:** Developing a Wales Futures Hub across the Welsh Public Service to pool resources, diversify perspectives, and provide constructive challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>.

Key insights from Wales include tailoring work to different audiences, using a hands-on approach beyond just publishing reports, framing foresight as a tool for better decision-making (not accurate predictions), finding logical entry points for integration, and effectively leveraging diverse networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

### Nesta (UK): Strategic Foresight for Transformative Innovation

Nesta, the UK's Innovation Agency for social good, uses strategic foresight to inform [[incorporating_values_in_anticipatory_innovation | transformative innovation]] across its missions in Education, Health, and Sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. Their Discovery team (foresight and futures) is embedded in the strategy department to help colleagues think beyond 2030 and anticipate changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>.

They support teams through various methods:
*   **Horizon Scanning:** Understanding the impact of emerging technology and social change (e.g., Future Signals series, Minister for the Future essay series on long-term policy ideas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.
*   **Stress-testing Ideas and Answering Big Questions:** Exploring future payment for home heating or lessons from international obesity policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **Novel Approaches:** Blending traditional foresight techniques with data science, qualitative research, and design (e.g., Innovation Sweet Spots program combining foresight with open data sets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>.
*   **Speculating and Prototyping:** Exploring future applications (e.g., generative AI in early years education, future uses for the UK's gas grid, synthetic biology for climate change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.
*   **Exposing Staff to New Ideas:** Bringing in external perspectives and practices (e.g., Discovery Month on generative AI, residencies of experts from mission sectors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>.
*   **Creating Space for Exploration:** Designing programs for experimental, self-directed work (e.g., sabbaticals, Explorations Week where staff explore new topics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.

Nesta has observed benefits such as increased confidence in dealing with uncertainty, bolder ideas, and greater comfort with failure among their colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:59">[01:08:59]</a>.

## General Principles and Challenges

*   **Ecosystems Approach:** Instead of focusing on a single "super team," foster a healthy ecosystem where foresight is embedded throughout the organization, considering culture, behavior, processes, structures, and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>. Changing culture and behavior is often the most challenging part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>.
*   **Challenging Conventional Thinking:** The transformational power of foresight lies in challenging assumptions at all stages of policymaking to enable a culture of [[anticipatory_innovation_and_engaging_with_the_future | anticipation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>.
*   **Tool Selection:** Focus on quality over quantity when choosing foresight tools and methods, selecting those that best fit the question and investigation style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>. The UK Government Office for Science's Future Thinking and Foresight [[toolkit_for_anticipatory_innovation | toolkit]] is a valuable resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.
*   **Involving Stakeholders:** To introduce foresight, engage people directly in using the tools, even on hypothetical topics, and encourage them to reflect on its utility in their daily work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact:** While there are no single "right" metrics, impact can be observed by how widely the message spreads among policy designers and in public discussion, indicating a realization of the challenge and a need for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>. Setting thresholds or milestones (e.g., key persons realizing an issue) can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>.
*   **Managing Long-Term Strategies:** For long-term ambitions (2040-2050), set sensible milestones, establish robust governance (e.g., project boards), and maintain flexibility to adapt to accelerating changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>.

The vibrant community of [[anticipatory_innovation | foresight practitioners]] worldwide fosters hope that governments can effectively use foresight to work with policymakers, integrate a long-term perspective, and create a more [[crisis_management_and_future_preparedness | resilient society]] that actively shapes its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:35">[01:24:35]</a>.

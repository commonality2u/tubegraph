The OECD's "Mind Shift Green Lift: Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy" report highlights the critical role of human behavior in tackling [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The green transition is not solely about technology or policies; it is fundamentally about how people live, work, and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Achieving progress requires a deep understanding of human behavior to bridge the gap between ambitious goals and real-world impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Centrality of Human Behavior
Human behavior is central to the green transition, necessitating changes from individuals, businesses, and governments alike to achieve a green, low-carbon future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Research suggests that behavioral shifts in key areas such as transport, food consumption, and energy use could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70% by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

[[Behavioral science and climate change | Behavioral science]] offers valuable insights into encouraging these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. It supports governments in shaping better policies by understanding how people make decisions, which is increasingly important for demand-side strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Key Trends in [[Behavioral Science in Environmental Policy | Behavioral Science in Environmental Policy]]
The report identifies six key trends illustrating how governments are harnessing [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] to accelerate the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. These trends are based on an analysis of over 100 case studies from more than 30 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### 1. Integrating [[Behavioral Science in Environmental Policy | Behavioral Science]] Across the Policy Cycle
Historically, [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] was often applied late in the policy process, primarily for fine-tuning existing policies or improving communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. However, there's a rapid shift towards using [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] at every stage, including the very beginning, to better understand behavioral challenges and design more effective policies from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] France: Repairability Index for Electronic Products
> The French interministerial directorate for public transformation developed a repairability index for electronic products to promote sustainable consumer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. They applied [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] at every policy stage:
> *   **Problem Identification:** 62% of consumers discarded broken electronic devices without considering repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
> *   **Design & Testing:** [[Behavioral science and climate change | Behavioral science]] was used to design and test labels to empower consumers to make informed choices about repairability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
> *   **Implementation & Assessment:** The most successful label was implemented, leading to consumers increasingly opting for laptops with higher repairability scores and manufacturers introducing more repairable models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
> This intervention was effective on both consumer demand and product supply sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

### 2. Driving [[Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation | Climate Adaptation Efforts]]
While [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] traditionally focused on [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation | climate change mitigation]] (reducing emissions), its role in [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation | climate adaptation]] is expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. Adaptation involves adjusting behaviors to deal with immediate and long-term effects of [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate change]], such as preventing wildfires or guiding actions during floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Effective adaptation policies require grounding in how people actually behave, leading policymakers to increasingly turn to [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] for smarter, more responsive strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Australia: Drought Assistance for Farmers
> During a severe drought from 2017-2019, the Australian government's Behavioral Economics Team (BETA) studied barriers and motivators influencing farmers' willingness to seek assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. Key barriers included:
> *   Lack of concrete knowledge on how to ask for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
> *   Overly complicated and lengthy application processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
> *   Stigma attached to asking for help, causing farmers to wait until situations became critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
> *   Non-personalized information that lacked relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
> BETA recommended reframing support with [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] to encourage farmers to seek assistance before a crisis point and establishing trusted local points of contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

### 3. Predicting and Accounting for Public Acceptability of Green Reforms
Understanding how people perceive and respond to policies is crucial for successful green reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. By leveraging data, especially longitudinal data, governments can gauge citizens' [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate awareness]], support for reforms, preferences, and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. This enables the design of clearer, more accessible policies aligned with public values, fostering trust and strengthening the impact of green reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Netherlands: SME Investment in Sustainability
> The [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] team at the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy researched factors influencing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to invest in sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Findings showed that while 64% of SMEs were inclined to be more sustainable, only 5-18% had taken feasible steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. Motivators included high energy prices, cost savings, and legal compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>, while barriers included high perceived costs (time and money) and preference for other priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. This research was instrumental in shaping tailored policy approaches for SMEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

### 4. Boosting Citizen Participation in Environmental Policies
Governments and civil society actors are increasingly using [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] to proactively and inclusively engage citizens in shaping and implementing green policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. This mobilizes diverse groups and creates more opportunities for public involvement in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. [[Behavioral science and climate change | Behavioral science]] helps bridge the trust gap between citizens and governments by aligning policies with public expectations, fostering trust, and removing barriers to participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Ireland: National Dialogue on Climate Action
> Ireland's National Dialogue on Climate Action, led by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, aims to engage citizens directly in [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. Its goals include:
> *   Raising awareness, understanding, and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
> *   Motivating and enabling [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate action]], empowering citizens to adopt sustainable behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
> *   Using findings to inform policy responses and [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.
> Over 12,000 citizens have participated in annual climate conversations since 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. The program developed a behavioral insights dashboard to help policymakers integrate evidence from social and behavioral studies into policy design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

### 5. Increasing Demand for Sustainable Goods, Services, and Technologies
Governments are increasingly using [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] to drive demand for sustainable goods, services, and technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. Demand-side policies are essential and could reduce emissions by as much as 70% by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. Strategies include:
*   Designing and testing labels to encourage sustainable consumer choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   Removing barriers to increase the use of green services like public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.
*   Encouraging the adoption of green technologies (e.g., heat pumps) by making them financially appealing and easier to adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Denmark: Climate Labels for Food Choices
> The Danish Competition and Consumer Authority tested two types of climate labels to guide consumers towards sustainable food choices: a "best-in-class" label and a "scale" label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. While consumers preferred the scale label and it improved their ability to identify climate-friendly alternatives, it did not significantly change overall purchasing behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. The aggregate effect on CO2 emissions was neutral, partly because some consumers reduced emissions while others increased them, and detailed product-specific information was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>. The team suggested clearer, more specific information and broader consumer engagement and education for greater effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

### 6. Building Resilience to [[Addressing Climate Misinformation | Climate Misinformation]]
Governments are leveraging [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] to build resilience against and tackle the spread of [[addressing_climate_misinformation | climate misinformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>. This involves understanding susceptibility to misinformation and developing strategies to counter its impact and strengthen democratic resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Canada: PARCA Initiative
> Canada's Program of Applied Research on [[climate_change_and_public_policy | Climate Action]] (PARCA) conducts national surveys and in-depth studies to assess the public's susceptibility to [[addressing_climate_misinformation | climate misinformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. The aim is to understand how Canadians think, feel, and act when confronted with misinformation, and to identify the most harmful types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
> In 2024, a randomized controlled trial tested interventions to boost resilience:
> *   Encouraging individuals to assess information accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.
> *   Strengthening digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
> *   Preemptive refutation (actively correcting false claims) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.
> Interventions focused on enhancing digital media literacy and providing active preemptive refutations were most effective in reducing susceptibility and spread of false news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. However, passive information about finding misinformation made people more skeptical and less accurate in identifying true headlines, suggesting unintended consequences from non-critical thinking approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.

## Moving from Insights to Action: Recommendations for Governments
To move beyond trends and accelerate the green transition, governments are encouraged to harness [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] to trigger positive social tipping points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. Positive social tipping points are key moments where small shifts in behavior can lead to large-scale, lasting change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.

1.  **Create Conditions for Positive Tipping Points:** Identify critical moments and behaviors that can spark systemic change, amplifying traditional policies and ensuring enduring behavioral shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.
2.  **Drive Demand for Sustainable Choices:** When more people adopt sustainable behaviors (e.g., energy-efficient products, public transport), it creates a ripple effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. [[Behavioral science and climate change | Behavioral science]] tools like default options and dynamic social norms can drive widespread adoption and habit changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
3.  **Engage Citizens as Active Participants:** Governments should use [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] to empower people as agents of change, reducing barriers to participation, building trust, and aligning policies with public expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>.
4.  **Strengthen Decision-Making Within Governments:** Integrate [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] into governmental decision-making processes for environmental policies to reduce biases and improve overall effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

## Caveats and Considerations
*   **Individual Responsibility:** It is crucial not to place the entire burden of responsibility solely on individuals. Instead, the aim is to empower consumers, users, and citizens to be active participants in the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   **Not a Silver Bullet:** While behavioral change is important, [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] is just one piece of a broader strategy for reducing emissions and contributing to [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation | climate adaptation]] policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. A holistic approach incorporating technology and systemic changes is necessary for meaningful progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.
*   **Broad Definition of Demand-Side Policies:** In this context, the demand-side approach extends beyond individual choices. It also includes the influence of governments themselves (e.g., through procurement efforts) and industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. Achieving real impact demands collaboration across all sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

## [[Challenges and opportunities in implementing missionoriented climate strategies | Challenges and Opportunities]]
There are significant challenges, including a "backlash against everything green" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a> and a pervasive "trust in government crisis" globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. Misinformation about [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate change]] is also a top global concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

However, [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral approaches]] offer valuable tools, especially when large systemic changes become difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>. They can be more adaptable, local, and participatory ("little speedboats rather than huge tankers") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. They can help build horizontal trust and motivate sustainability at a smaller scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>. Engaging in "deep listening" and empathy is crucial to understanding differing opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.

Moving forward, the discussion should also include:
*   How to better regulate the supply side using [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral insights]], such as "budges" that restrict or regulate suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.
*   Testing combinations and sequencing of various fiscal and [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral policies]], where softer policies can be introduced first to build understanding and support for harder ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.
*   The role of digital technologies and AI in personalizing interventions to meet different target groups, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

The OECD's commitment to advancing the role of [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] in the green transition, exemplified by projects like Net Zero Plus, aims to deliver a rapid, just, and resilient transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing resilience to [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation | changing climate impacts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This includes focusing on demand-side policies for [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation | climate change mitigation]] across sectors like energy use in buildings, transport, waste, and diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

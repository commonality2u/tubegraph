The relationship between government and citizens is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by [[democratic_innovations | democratic innovations]] at local, regional, and international levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This shift is crucial when considering the future of democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. People's expectations regarding [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | participation in public decision making]] have evolved, with citizens often less trusting of government but more engaged in issues affecting their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. They seek to contribute meaningfully to shaping decisions that impact them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Reframing the Citizen Role
A key aspect of this evolving relationship is the need to reframe how people are viewed – moving from "consumers" to "citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. John Alexander, founder of the New Citizenship Project, suggests that current democratic structures often operate as a "consumer democracy," where individuals primarily choose from offered options rather than actively shaping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This contrasts with a vision where citizens are active participants, akin to being "allowed in the kitchen" rather than just choosing from a menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The goal is to infuse the same creativity and energy into the democratic relationship as is seen in consumerism, making democracy joyful, meaningful, and dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This shift is seen as an existential challenge; without transforming the citizen-state relationship, democracy itself is at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Citizens as Agents of Change
Pepin, an elected official in the Brussels regional parliament and co-founder of Agora Brussels, exemplifies this reframing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Agora Brussels advocates for the permanent installation of a deliberative citizens' assembly with actual legislative influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This initiative aims to turn citizens from "consumers of political ideas" into "agents of their own political change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Democratic Fitness and System Redesign
Zakia Elvang, co-founder of We Do Democracy in Denmark, emphasizes that democracy is a design that can be redesigned and revitalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. She advocates for treating democracy not just as a concept but as something to be actively "trained" and "practiced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This concept of "democratic fitness" involves strengthening democratic muscles like listening, empathy, compromising, and activism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Such training is vital for creating arenas where systems and citizens can effectively engage to solve societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## Transnational and Digital Dimensions
The Conference on the Future of Europe is a large-scale [[democratic_innovations | democratic innovation]] with a strong deliberative component, involving randomly selected European citizens panels reflecting on Europe's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This initiative explores the transnational dimension of active citizenship and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. It combines a multilingual digital platform for contributions with citizen panels and a plenary session that mixes citizens with politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

However, the increasing reliance on digital platforms for democracy raises concerns about privacy and the privatization of public space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. Dan Podjed highlights that spending extensive time on private platforms like Zoom, Twitter, and Facebook for democratic engagement risks feeding "digital capitalism" or "digital feudalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. This raises questions about personal data ownership and the importance of physical reality and face-to-face communication for human interaction and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.

## The Crucial Question of Power
A central theme in discussions about government-citizen dynamics is the transfer of power. While [[democratic_innovations | democratic innovations]] are increasing, the true shift in power remains contentious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. Questions arise about the "contract of power" offered to citizens in initiatives like the Conference on the Future of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Ensuring that citizen proposals translate into actual policy initiatives and are subject to accountability is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.

Concerns include:
*   **Disappointment and Frustration** If citizens participate but their input is not meaningfully acted upon, it can lead to frustration and potentially be counterproductive for trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.
*   **"Cherry-picking" by Politicians** The risk that policymakers selectively implement recommendations that align with existing agendas, while ignoring others, undermines the legitimacy and impact of [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | citizen participation in policy making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Clarity** It is crucial to be clear with citizens from the outset about the extent to which their recommendations will be adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. Setting clear commitments, such as implementing a specific percentage of recommendations, can help manage expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.
*   **Building Trust** [[Public trust and governance | Trust]] building needs to start from government institutions extending meaningful power to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.

## Beyond Formal Processes
The impact of [[democratic_innovations | democratic innovations]] extends beyond direct legislative changes. It includes strengthening social networks, fostering engagement, and inspiring new forms of participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. This "democratic fitness" — the transformative effect on individuals' sense of agency and political efficacy — is a valuable impact of deliberative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

This shift represents "birthing pains" as societies transition from a purely representative democracy, where decisions are delegated, to one where citizens demand a greater role in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. Deliberative processes are not merely new forms of participation but can be conceptualized as new forms of representation, where participants act as "citizen representatives," leading to a redesign rather than replacement of representative democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.

## Paths Forward
To facilitate this change, several commitments and considerations are highlighted:
*   **People-centered Solutions**: Moving from expert-based solutions to [[citizen_centered_governance_and_its_challenges_during_crises | citizen-centered governance]] requires identifying user groups, talking to people, involving them in solution interpretation, and iterative testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.
*   **Role of Media**: Media plays a crucial role in highlighting [[democratic_innovations | democratic innovations]] and fostering [[public_participation and trust in urban governance | public participation and trust in urban governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. By focusing on constructive, innovative democratic processes rather than just political conflicts, media can contribute to societal progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>.
*   **Entrepreneurs and Hybrid Models**: The private sector, particularly entrepreneurs, are key drivers of [[democratic_innovations | democratic innovations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. Hybrid models that combine the long-term perspective of the public sector with the fast-paced, risk-willing energy of private initiatives can be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. Spaces like "democracy garages" can serve as physical arenas for democratic actors to collaborate on specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.
*   **Continuous Engagement**: Policymakers must be consistently encouraged to listen to citizens and engage in dialogue at all stages of the policy-making cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>.

While there is a "yes and" approach to the ongoing changes – acknowledging positive movement while pushing for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a> – there is also a recognition of simultaneous movement in both positive and negative directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. The shift in power dynamics between government and citizens is critical to strengthening society's democratic fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

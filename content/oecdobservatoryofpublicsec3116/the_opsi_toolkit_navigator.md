Public servants frequently encounter a variety of unique challenges, problems, or situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While innovation tools and methods can provide new approaches to help address these, there is an abundance of available tools, making it difficult to know where or how to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Hundreds of innovation tools, toolkits, guides, and playbooks already exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. What is needed is a "better filter" or "compass" to guide individuals to the appropriate resources for their innovation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Purpose and Functionality

The [[development_and_purpose_of_the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] was created to address this need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Its primary function is to connect a user's specific situation, problem, or challenge to a relevant toolkit that can assist them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. By filtering out excess information, it aims to provide a clearer path for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## [[development_and_purpose_of_the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | Development Process]]

The [[observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] developed this resource in collaboration with hundreds of public servants and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The development involved several key steps:

1.  **Analysis and Organization**: Hundreds of existing toolkits were analyzed and organized based on the actions they inform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  **Situation Exploration**: Common situations, problems, and challenges faced by public servants were explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  **User Language Study**: Research was conducted into how public servants typically describe what they want to achieve and how they conceptualize their situations or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
4.  **[[navigational_paths_for_innovation_tool_selection | Navigational Path Design]]**: [[navigational_paths_for_innovation_tool_selection | Navigational path options]] were designed to bridge the gap between user situations and desired actions, enabling the [[development_and_purpose_of_the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] to suggest tools based on intended outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Beyond Tool Selection

While finding the right tool is important, innovation encompasses more than just that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The [[development_and_purpose_of_the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] also extends its utility by connecting users to:

*   Skills and capacity-building resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Real-life case studies demonstrating innovation in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Fellow public servants and experts who have navigated similar paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

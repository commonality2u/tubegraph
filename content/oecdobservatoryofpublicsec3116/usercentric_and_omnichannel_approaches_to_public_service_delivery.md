This article explores the critical importance of [[inclusive_service_design_in_government | user-centric]] and omnichannel approaches in the [[digital_transformation_of_public_services | digital transformation of public services]], drawing insights from global experiences and the challenges posed by events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The core question revolves around the significance of considering users while leveraging [[digital_transformation_of_public_services | digital opportunities]] to design and deliver services in the digital age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The "Digital by Default" Dilemma

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the expectation for governments to be "digital by default" as individuals were largely digital in their personal and professional interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, panellists highlighted that a "digital by default" mindset can limit thinking, potentially creating disconnected experiences if digital services are viewed as entirely separate from traditional ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

The key challenges identified in adopting a purely digital approach include:
*   Closing in-person access to government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Skills and capabilities of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, particularly for those unfamiliar or uncomfortable with digital technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   Access to the internet in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   Accessibility needs for diverse groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   The lack of [[collaborative_approaches_in_public_sector_innovation | collaboration]] inside government to solve whole problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Difficulties in getting access to data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Different silos in government that operate services in different places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

It is crucial to remember that services must respond to the needs of people who expect them to be [[inclusive_service_design_in_government | inclusive]] and trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Many people do not want to use online channels to interact with public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, and this choice should be respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

## Key Ingredients for Success

Successful [[challenges_and_solutions_in_public_service_delivery | public service delivery]] in the digital age requires a multifaceted approach:

### 1. User Focus and Design Thinking
Services need to be usable, useful, and designed with users in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. This means:
*   **User Research**: Conducting extensive research and talking to citizens to understand their context and needs, even if it's not done enough today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Services**: Design should focus on simplifying services at their core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>, including using clear language instead of technical jargon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
*   **Accessibility**: Ensuring communication and services are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities or those who are not comfortable with digital tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

### 2. Omnichannel Delivery
Good services support multiple channels and allow users to switch between them throughout their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This means:
*   **Balancing Digital and Physical**: Maintaining traditional physical channels, even if they are more expensive or have limited hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Service Networks**: Establishing physical locations like "city and shops" or "citizen spaces" where trained mediators can assist citizens with digital services, thereby improving their digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Portugal's mobile citizen spaces are a notable example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **Consistent Quality**: Providing a consistent quality of service across all channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.

### 3. Digital Skills and Capabilities
Investment in digital skills is crucial for both public servants and citizens:
*   **Public Servants**: Governments need public servants with the skills, capabilities, and understanding of agile ways of working to react quickly to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Systematic improvement of knowledge and skills within the administration through training and fostering a modern business culture is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Citizens**: Initiatives to increase digital literacy are vital, especially for populations that have never used the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. Programs like France's "digital pass" offering free classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>, and Slovenia's digital vouchers and computer science in schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>, aim to upskill citizens.

### 4. Data Utilization and Governance
The effective and responsible use of data is a key enabler for digital services:
*   **Data for Efficiency**: Using existing data from government registers to pre-fill application forms for citizens, embodying the "once-only" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.
*   **Data Exchange Platforms**: Establishing multi-purpose data exchange platforms to connect various data sources within public administration and beyond, reducing the need for constant citizen interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Trust**: Demonstrating transparency in data use, respecting legal frameworks (like GDPR), and providing clear explanations of data processing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. Independent oversight, such as an information commissioner, builds public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.
*   **Overarching Strategic Data Management**: Implementing strategies that cover open, closed, and personal data at technical, semantic, organizational, and legal levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

### 5. Collaboration and Integration
Overcoming silos and fostering [[collaborative_approaches_in_public_sector_innovation | collaboration]] across government departments is fundamental:
*   **Common Components and Platforms**: Developing shared toolkits, platforms (e.g., notification platforms like UK's Notify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>), and design patterns to standardize and accelerate service development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Joined-Up Services**: Designing services that don't stop at departmental boundaries, stitching together related services across different departments to offer seamless user journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. A single domain, like Gov.uk, can force departments to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Institutional Networks**: Establishing networks or councils that connect different government areas to facilitate coordination and quick responses to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

## Innovation and Adaptability

The role of [[innovation_in_public_services | innovation labs]] in public sector transformation is a subject of debate. While some view them as a "fashion," panellists generally agreed they can be valuable:
*   **Test Beds and Inspiration**: Innovation labs provide spaces to experiment and fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>, offering test beds and good examples that can inspire public servants to be more agile and adaptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>.
*   **Catalysts for Change**: They can help get buy-in by demonstrating new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>.
*   **Integration is Key**: However, there is a risk of them being seen as separate from the rest of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>. They must be anchored back into the broader institutional and organizational context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a> and have a plan for how their innovations will be rolled out to the wider government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.
*   **Innovation in Improvement**: Innovation isn't just about building new things; it also resides in continually improving existing, frequently used services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>.

## Future Commitments

Looking ahead, key commitments for strengthening [[digital_transformation_of_public_services | digital transformation and inclusion in government services]] include:
*   **Pragmatism and Flexibility**: Being more pragmatic and flexible in applying standards and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>.
*   **Accelerating Digital Government**: Providing a common framework for design and delivery to create a single public administration for citizens to interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.
*   **Improving Data Governance**: Continuing to improve data utilization and governance to enable faster, more agile responses, especially in future emergency situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:49]</a>.
*   **Pushing for Inclusivity and Design**: Shifting the mindset of leaders and decision-makers to prioritize inclusivity and design in service development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>.
*   **Systematic Improvement and Coordination**: Continuously improving conditions for online service delivery, enhancing coordination and connectedness among stakeholders, and integrating [[tools_and_approaches_for_implementing_cocreation_in_public_sector | co-creation]], [[collaborative_approaches_in_public_sector_innovation | collaboration]], and design thinking into new strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:28">[01:26:28]</a>.

Ultimately, being digital does not mean that all users are digital. The purpose of [[inclusive_service_design_in_government | inclusive public services]] in the digital age is to provide a consistent experience for all users across all channels, managing the risk of exclusion. This journey requires strong leadership, the right skills and mindset within administration, robust key components (including data), and clear, accessible [[digital_tools_for_communication_in_public_services | communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>.

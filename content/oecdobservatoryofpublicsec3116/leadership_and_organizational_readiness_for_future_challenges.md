Discussions surrounding **anticipatory innovation governance** (AIG) are crucial for [[preparing_governments_for_future_challenges | governments]] and public sector organizations to address complex issues and define potential futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>. This framework, developed by the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, aims to enhance readiness for unprecedented future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

## The Need for Anticipatory Innovation Governance

The world is characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and novelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:33">[07:47:33]</a>. Governments face complex problems daily and must respond to environmental challenges, including technological shifts, in an adequate manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:06">[07:56:06]</a>.

### The Innovator's Dilemma in the Public Sector
Established practices and policies can become outdated as environmental conditions change and new ideas emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. Onboarding "disrespectful information" or ideas that challenge the current paradigm is difficult because current stakeholders often provide information based on existing services, not future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:48">[10:57:48]</a>. This phenomenon, known as the "innovator's dilemma," has affected large private sector companies like Canon and Nokia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:35">[11:31:35]</a>.

### Controlling Technological Developments
Governments often face the "Collingridge dilemma" (referred to as the "coloring rich dilemma" in the transcript), where the ability to control technological change is greatest in early phases, but evidence of potential impacts only emerges in later phases when control is diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. For example, early influence over platform economies like Uber was possible, but once widespread, rolling back such developments becomes very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>. This necessitates governments to think about technological and non-technological changes early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.

### Limitations of Static Future Perspectives
Traditionally, governments have viewed the future from a static perspective, often using tools like the "futures cone" to develop strategies for five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. However, this approach can lead to being "five different ways of being wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. For anticipation and [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] to be impactful for innovation, a continuous practice is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>.

Futures are created through continuous dialogue in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. [[future_engagement_and_uncertainty_management | Anticipatory innovation]] involves looking at future trends and possibilities but taking action in the present, such as experimenting and developing ideas to test possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>.

## Defining Key Concepts

Anticipatory innovation governance clarifies the relationship between anticipation, innovation, and governance.

### Anticipation
Anticipation involves creating knowledge about the future, drawn from existing contextual factors, underlying values, worldviews, assumptions, and emerging developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. It is connected to the "potentiality and possibility" of the future and is an ongoing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>.

### Innovation
Innovation means acting upon that knowledge by changing systems (processes, services, products) and exploring alternative futures on the ground to influence the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:00">[26:45:00]</a>. This moves beyond a "wait and see" position to actively shaping a preferable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>.

### Anticipatory Innovation Governance
Anticipatory innovation governance refers to a system of structures, institutions, agencies, and the environment that supports the activity of creating knowledge about the future and acting upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:00]</a>. It addresses the inability of governments to test critical, contradictory, or transformative ideas that go beyond current paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a>.

### Distinction from Strategic Foresight
[[Strategic foresight and its challenges in implementation | Strategic foresight]] is exceptionally important for providing input into anticipation by identifying signals about upcoming developments, reading weak signals, or validating strong ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. However, [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] often suffers from an "impact gap" or "implementation gap," where insights are not translated into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>. Anticipatory innovation governance addresses this by building mechanisms to take [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] knowledge and develop implemented, value-shifting innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

### Distinction from Resilience
While [[continuous_improvement_and_organizational_resilience | anticipatory innovation]] can feed into [[continuous_improvement_and_organizational_resilience | resilience]], they are not the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:00">[33:40:00]</a>. [[continuous_improvement_and_organizational_resilience | Resilience]] aims to make a system more prepared for external shocks, allowing it to expand without breaking and uphold core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>. However, governments may need to fundamentally change, not just be [[continuous_improvement_and_organizational_resilience | resilient]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:33:00">[34:33:00]</a>. Anticipation provides information on when to stop being [[continuous_improvement_and_organizational_resilience | resilient]] and build new structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.

### Distinction from Adaptive Capacity
Adaptive or agile capacity involves tactical and adaptive responses to innovation during a crisis, where quick action and experimentation are needed without extensive strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a>. Anticipatory innovation enhances both [[continuous_improvement_and_organizational_resilience | resilient]] and adaptive capacities by providing guidance on the right direction and identifying when fundamental system changes are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>.

### Distinction from Mission-Oriented Innovation
Mission-driven innovation is led by a single, agreed-upon purpose, like decarbonizing an economy by a specific timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>. This approach activates efforts to find solutions towards that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>. However, even with clear missions, the unexpected is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>. Anticipatory innovation helps identify side effects of missions or new challenges that may arise from pursuing a specific goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a>.

## Building an Anticipatory Innovation Governance System

Building an AIG system requires recognizing that the future isn't built in a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:38:00">[39:38:00]</a>. Key system elements for governments to constantly build simultaneously include:

*   **Demand:** Cultivating a leadership culture that requires [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] and [[future_engagement_and_uncertainty_management | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:15:00">[40:15:00]</a>.
*   **Capacity:** Developing the necessary knowledge and skills, such as having horizon scanners and scenario planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:30:00">[40:30:00]</a>.
*   **Embeddedness:** Ensuring that other system elements, like electoral cycles and policy reviews, are coordinated with anticipatory activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>. Implementation plans should be clear in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:00">[41:01:00]</a>.
*   **Institutions:** Having different teams responsible for [[future_engagement_and_uncertainty_management | anticipatory innovation]] that connect with the wider organization and decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>.
*   **Feedback:** Establishing systems to evaluate how well anticipation was used and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:44:00">[41:44:00]</a>.

### Addressing Biases and Challenges
Overcoming biases is crucial for AIG, including expert bias and the "minimal squeak behavior" in the public sector where non-urgent issues are ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:41:00">[52:41:00]</a>. The tendency to treat policy problems linearly and present oneself as an expert also hinders addressing uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:21:00">[53:21:21]</a>.

### Starting Points for Implementation
Organizations can begin by making a case for change, understanding their current system, and outlining the roles needed for anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:19:00">[57:19:00]</a>. This includes having formal [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] or risk assessment systems, but also ensuring that this information feeds into policy choices and encourages exploration of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:10:00">[58:10:00]</a>. It also involves granting autonomy to critical thinking teams who challenge the status quo, while maintaining linkages to integrate learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:45:00">[59:45:00]</a>.

### Case Examples
*   **Sweden (Vinnova):** As an early supporter, Vinnova, the leading innovation agency in Sweden, opened its doors for analysis of its innovation portfolio and provided thought leadership on AIG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.
*   **Finland:** Finland has one of the most advanced [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] systems in government, with multiple teams and institutions across ministries and a parliamentary committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:59:00">[41:59:00]</a>. Their ability to respond to COVID-19 was enhanced by decentralized [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] and anticipation capabilities within different ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:21:00">[59:21:00]</a>.
*   **Helsingborg, Sweden:** This city consciously decided to become an anticipatory organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:56:00">[48:56:00]</a>. Their journey started with building [[the_evolving_nature_of_leadership_in_times_of_crisis | leadership]] capacity among city managers and politicians to engage with futures and [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:10:00">[49:10:00]</a>. This enabled decisions to support anticipatory innovation projects as test beds, now integrating learnings into broader city practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:44:00">[49:44:00]</a>.
*   **Ireland, Slovenia, Latvia:** The OECD is actively working with these countries to develop AIG systems, focusing on understanding system roles, capacities, and integrating AIG into innovation portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:22:00">[57:22:00]</a>.

## Leadership's Role

[[the_evolving_nature_of_leadership_in_times_of_crisis | Leadership]] is critical for [[organizational_habits_and_futures_thinking | organizational habits]] and [[future_engagement_and_uncertainty_management | futures thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>. A strong leader needs to be open-minded enough to engage in activities that might challenge current assumptions or suggest their current approach is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:26:00">[52:26:00]</a>.

### Challenges for Leaders
[[the_evolving_nature_of_leadership_in_times_of_crisis | Leadership]] interested in uncertain futures faces significant political risk and accountability if things go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:18:00">[51:18:00]</a>. There's often less accountability for missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:39:00">[51:39:00]</a>. A significant challenge is the societal expectation that leaders should "have the answers" and be responsible for the future, which is an unreasonable demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:28:00">[54:28:00]</a>.

### Signs of Leadership Capability in AIG
Indicators of [[the_evolving_nature_of_leadership_in_times_of_crisis | leadership]] capability in [[future_engagement_and_uncertainty_management | anticipatory innovation]] include:
*   A process or deliverable to explore potential future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:00">[55:50:00]</a>.
*   Senior management engaging with and listening to alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:57:00">[55:57:00]</a>.
*   A person or team dedicated to developing alternative futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:02:00">[56:02:00]</a>.
*   A person or team whose job is to propose different actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:07:00">[56:07:00]</a>.

Organizations cannot definitively know the next crisis or when it will hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. However, signs of readiness include thinking through multiple alternative future contexts, taking concrete action for redundancy, and not solely focusing on maximum efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>.

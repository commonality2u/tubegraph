The COVID-19 pandemic revealed significant [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_health_systems | vulnerabilities within health systems]] globally, particularly concerning their capacity to absorb and manage rapid change, and the availability and deployment of their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. This global shock prompted a re-evaluation of what aspects of pre-crisis operations should be left behind, what should be kept, and what should be done differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## Capacity Challenges

Health systems faced immediate and profound [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_administration | challenges]] in scaling up to meet the demands of the pandemic:
*   **Insufficient Funding** Latvia, for instance, has historically struggled with an underfunded health system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, yet managed to perform a "miracle" by reorganizing and utilizing existing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Shortage of Critical Care Beds** Ireland experienced a shortage of critical care beds and was in the process of health service reform when the crisis hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The focus shifted to building surge capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Disruption of Routine Services**
    *   Many countries, including Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> and Latvia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>, deferred most routine elective scheduled care activity to create space for COVID-19 patients. This led to a significant backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
    *   Sweden also stopped screening programs and elective surgery during the first wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
    *   Israel initially faced similar problems, focusing intensely on the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   **Bed vs. Workforce** While initial concerns often focused on the number of beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>, the actual constraint was frequently the availability of healthcare workers to staff those beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

## Workforce Challenges

The human element of healthcare was severely tested during the pandemic:
*   **Rapid Redeployment and Re-qualification** Health systems had to rapidly re-qualify and redeploy staff in record time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Staff Willingness and Fatigue**
    *   In Ireland, there was a strong willingness among all staff, especially nursing staff, to undertake training and support surge capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
    *   However, key workers had to self-isolate, leading to weariness after months on the front line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.
    *   Sweden also noted its health workforce was "very tired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.
*   **Recruitment Difficulties** Ireland faced challenges recruiting staff for dedicated testing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Shortage and Over-employment** Latvia faced a general shortage of healthcare workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. Many nurses and doctors worked in several places, making it difficult to apply the safest infection control approaches as restricting them to one workplace would shut down half the system due to lack of human resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.
*   **Future Workforce Outlook** Interestingly, Sweden observed a 30% increase in young people applying for doctor and nurse programs in universities, suggesting that becoming a healthcare worker is now "super attractive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Strategies

Countries adapted and learned from the initial shock, developing new strategies to address both capacity and workforce challenges:
*   **Balancing COVID and Non-COVID Care (The Double Burden)**
    *   After the first wave, where many hospitals canceled non-emergency care, countries learned to manage the "double burden" of COVID and non-COVID patients more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
    *   Latvia prioritized keeping healthcare open as long as possible in the second wave, reorganizing beds for COVID patients by shrinking ambulatory care rather than planned care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.
    *   Israel handled its second wave "completely differently," ensuring hospitals did not stop elective procedures or community-focused primary care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.
    *   Korea separated patient tracks into three levels: general hospitals for severe cases, "living care centers" for low-level care, and home isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. This approach aimed to avoid increased mortality for other diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.
    *   Sweden's strategy of avoiding a full lockdown in the first wave was partly driven by concerns for the broader health system, aiming to keep it working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.
*   **Leveraging [[digital_transformation_in_health_care | Digital Transformation]]**
    *   The crisis accelerated the adoption of [[digital_transformation_in_health_care | digital health]], including telehealth, online consultations, and electronic prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. These changes are expected to be permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:06">[02:23:06]</a>.
    *   Sweden made a "frog leap" in creating a [[digital_transformation_in_health_care | digitalized health system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
    *   Israel, already at the forefront of [[digital_transformation_in_health_care | digital health]], saw bureaucratic resistance "wiped out in a matter of days," leading to rapid adoption of practices like proactive chronic disease management and predictive analytics to identify high-risk patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Strengthening Community and Public Health**
    *   Ireland focused on community support for health and well-being, increasing its budget and leveraging local authorities and sporting organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.
    *   There is an increased need to invest in preventive measures and public health to tackle waiting times, not just through surgical interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.
*   **Improving Governance and Collaboration**
    *   Sweden found that the pandemic forced a "tight collaboration" in its previously fragmented health system, driven by a single common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
    *   Korea's success was partly due to existing governance structures, data infrastructure, and prior experience from the MERS crisis (2015), which led to the development of a crisis management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>.
    *   The crisis highlighted the need for better collaboration with civil society and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Policy Implications
> The crisis underscored that public health is a complex public policy issue inextricably linked to the economy, jobs, education, and public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. For Ireland, politicians largely followed expert advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>, while Latvia hoped to end the "false dilemma" of health versus economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>, emphasizing the need for universal healthcare and addressing social economic factors that impact health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>. Tackling inequalities is seen as a key step to ensuring people can follow health restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.

> There is a strong realization that maintaining a "barely sustainable, fully stretched healthcare system" has economic tolls, and that some "safety margins" are required for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>, as pandemics are here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>.

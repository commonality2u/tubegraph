Governments worldwide are increasingly recognizing the necessity to [[embracing_uncertainty_in_governance | anticipate]], experiment, and explore systemic solutions to both upcoming and existing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This focus emerged as a recurring theme from discussions involving over 4,500 participants across 60 events during the "Government After Shock" initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The recent crisis has opened a window of opportunity, making previously unavailable policy options accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The key question is how to sustain this momentum for innovation and transformation beyond the immediate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The discussion centers on methods and approaches that can make governments more anticipatory and transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Crisis Management

Governments operate within complex adaptive systems where culture, market, regulation, and the physical environment constantly co-evolve, creating inherent uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Innovation, unlike predictable economic models, is a much more uncertain process with largely uncertain outcomes and scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic revealed both the predictability of such an event, as scientists had warned about it, and the world's surprise at its actual occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. This highlights a need to better leverage scientific insights and adjust science systems to be better prepared for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. A paradoxical observation is that some countries decreased funding for epidemiology and public health institutions just before the crisis began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

Foresight exercises had indeed anticipated a coronavirus pandemic, but their recommendations often did not translate into actionable decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. This suggests a challenge in the mindset, where there is a tendency to extrapolate from the past rather than [[embracing_uncertainty_in_governance | embracing deep uncertainty]] where the future might be radically different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. It also reveals a potentially insufficient role of science in society, requiring scientists to improve communication and policymakers/public to better perceive its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.

### Accelerating Digitalization

The crisis highlighted Japan's society as "too old fashioned" in its digital infrastructure, leading to discussions about establishing a digital agency within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. A Digital Architecture Design Center was established to design innovative public sector infrastructure, initially targeting industrial safety, drone control, and mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

## Approaches to Managing Complexity and Uncertainty

### Agile and Adaptive Methods

The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), Europe's largest innovation network, was able to respond effectively to the crisis due to its focus on impact-driven projects, distributed structure, and maximized interaction across disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. These characteristics are considered key leverages in complex adaptive systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

EIT quickly deployed agile and adaptive working methods, assessed its project portfolio, and created a crisis response initiative to empower innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. They channeled €60 million into 207 new innovation projects and ventures from 32 countries, receiving 15,000 proposals in a very short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This rapid response was facilitated by a model combining top-down steering (focused on societal challenges and impact) with a distributed, bottom-up operationalization involving over 2,000 partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

### Goal-Based Regulation

In the age of digitalization and complex, fast-changing cyber-physical systems, governance models must become more agile and flexible, utilizing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Japan shifted from detailed, rule-based industrial safety regulations to a goal-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Under this new regulation, plant operators demonstrating high safety levels using technologies like real-time data monitoring and AI can extend statutory inspection terms from one year to up to eight years, providing significant benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

A white paper on "governance innovation" in Japan suggests that rules should be goal-based to allow room for innovative methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Under such regulations, multi-stakeholders create guidelines and standards, with real-time monitoring primarily conducted by businesses who are accountable for the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. These guidelines are continuously reviewed based on feedback from real-time data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

### [[Anticipatory innovation and governance | Anticipatory Governance]] and Foresight

[[the_role_of_government_in_technological_and_nontechnological_changes | The role of government in technological and nontechnological changes]] involves understanding how technology and society co-evolve simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Foresight and participatory technology assessment are crucial for anticipating plausible futures, not predicting them, to guide present actions towards desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This includes open processes for science, technology, and innovation (STI) agenda setting, and "upstream" forms of governance like "safe by design" and "ethics by design" for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

A "missions orientation" mechanism for STI policy is an attempt to bridge the gap between long-term goals (like decarbonizing production or addressing climate change) and actionable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>. This approach encourages cooperation and coordination among discrete agencies to move towards a shared, visible, long-term goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>.

The challenge of translating long-term scenarios into present decisions can be addressed by identifying "robust portfolios of options" or "robust solutions" – actions that work across different plausible future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. This involves looking for co-benefits or multiple dividends where one action can be beneficial even if an alternative scenario is realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

### Role of Science and Collaboration

The crisis demonstrated an unprecedented mobilization of resources within the science and innovation community across national borders and sectors, revealing new modes of cooperation and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

Key recommendations for improving the science system's contribution to crisis preparedness include:
*   **Interdisciplinary and Transdisciplinary Research:** Going beyond crossing disciplinary boundaries to involve science with other social and political spheres to close the gap between knowledge and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
*   **Strengthening Public-Private Science Linkages:** Facilitating collaboration between academic research and private sector science to leverage potential solutions and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Agility in Science System:** Accelerating the dissemination of scientific knowledge to policy circles and the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   **Supporting Risk Institutions:** Maintaining stable and robust institutions that deal with risks, such as research and science advisory bodies, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
*   **International Cooperation:** The [[role of government in crisis management | role of global networks]] and science as a public good is paramount, especially for developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

Collaboration with experts and citizens globally is key to achieving better governance in an age of uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Future Commitments

### Mindset Shift for [[systems_thinking_in_government_during_crises | Systems Thinking]]

To navigate complexity, it's essential to accept that we live in a complex adaptive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. While charting a way *out* of complexity might not be possible, successful navigation *through* it involves understanding, sense-making, and identifying leverage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. Speed is critical in influencing such systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

Policy makers should recognize that while measuring clear attribution or contribution to systemic change is often not possible with 100% certainty, flexibility in understanding uncertainty allows for progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>. Dividing larger complex systems into smaller ones can help identify leverage points more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

### Building Learning Systems

Goal-based regulation does not mean the government abdicates responsibility; instead, it requires constant checking of goal achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. To support private parties, especially SMEs, in achieving these goals, the government should provide appropriate standards or guidelines developed through a multi-stakeholder approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

Collaborative enforcement incentivizes businesses to cooperate and disclose information, even if problems exist, by offering commitments not to prosecute if they demonstrate good compliance programs and commit to future improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>. This fosters learning within the government about future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.

Ultimately, defining societal goals, like the balance between privacy and healthcare in contact tracing apps, is not merely an engineering question but involves social engineering, politics, and even philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:30">[01:46:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:55">[01:46:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>. This requires continuous discussion with stakeholders, implementation of technologies, and an iterative process of checking satisfaction with initial goals and adapting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:18">[01:47:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>. This dynamic, experimentation-oriented mindset is essential for governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>.

### Personal and Organizational Commitments

Panelists shared their commitments for the future:
*   **Hiroki Habuka (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan):** Governments must admit it's impossible to plan and order everything themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. The focus should be on goal-based, multi-stakeholder, cross-discipline, and cross-border experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. Japan has established a digital architecture design center and exchanges best practices on new regulatory approaches with other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>.
*   **Yena Rena (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis):** Every new scientific project and research will consider not only its specific goals but also how the knowledge created can be generalized for [[future_engagement_and_uncertainty_management | future crises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>.
*   **David Winov (OECD):** His group will study the diverse models of scientific and technological cooperation that emerged during the crisis to understand what might work in other contexts like vaccine development or antimicrobial resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>.
*   **Marton Heto (European Institute of Innovation and Technology):** To ensure readiness for uncertainty, he commits to "walking the talk," not panicking, being better safe than sorry, and investing in the future for his organization and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a>.

The overall sentiment is that by focusing on learning, adapting, and collaborating across sectors and borders, governments can be better prepared to navigate and even anticipate future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>.

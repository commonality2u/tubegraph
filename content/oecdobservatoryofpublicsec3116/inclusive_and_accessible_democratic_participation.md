The Co-creation Boot Camp brought together 100 individuals from the public sector, private sector, academia, and civil society organizations. Its aim was to co-create solutions addressing [[civic_participation_challenges | civic participation challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These challenges were presented by public sector teams from Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands, who committed to collaborating with society and leveraging emerging technologies to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Goals of the Initiative

The challenges tackled by the boot camp focused on centering people in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Technologies such as AI, blockchain, and virtual reality (VR) were adopted as tools to enhance [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | democratic participation]], with the ultimate goal of making governance more [[inclusive_services_and_public_policy_making | inclusive]] and [[equity_and_accessibility_in_public_service_delivery | accessible]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## The Design Sprint Process

To move from identifying a challenge to developing prototype solutions, participants followed a structured process designed by the OECD, modeled as a design sprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Step 1: Aligning on the Challenge

The initial step involved teams aligning on their chosen challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This required a deep understanding of the problem itself, its context, and any previous attempts to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Teams also identified key stakeholders and users, potential implementation barriers, and desired outcomes. This ensured a shared understanding and clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Step 2: Ideation and Solution Sketching

After clarifying the challenges, teams moved into the ideation phase, brainstorming and discussing potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Ideas were quickly generated and prioritized to directly address the identified challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The most promising ideas were then developed into well-articulated solution sketches, with quick drawings helping to give shape and form to the concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Step 3: Prototyping

Following ideation and sketching, teams refined their ideas, narrowing down possibilities to select one for prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The second day of the boot camp was entirely dedicated to developing this chosen idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Teams created a minimal prototype canvas based on their sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They explored various approaches, with some utilizing digital tools and emerging technologies, while others opted for traditional materials like Legos and modeling clay to quickly achieve a tangible representation of their solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Outcomes and Future Impact

As the boot camp concluded, teams prepared final pitches to showcase their solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. They presented their work from the two-day event in five-minute pitches to a jury of experts from Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Three solutions were selected for further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. These prototypes were recognized for pushing the boundaries of [[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | civic participation]] through the innovative use of emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The ideas generated during this boot camp are expected to shape the future of [[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | civic participation]] across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

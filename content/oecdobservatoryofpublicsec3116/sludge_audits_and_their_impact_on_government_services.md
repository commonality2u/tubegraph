Sludge audits represent a key initiative in [[improving_government_transparency_and_accountability | improving government transparency and accountability]] and service delivery by identifying and reducing unnecessary frictions that impede access to public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This approach, spearheaded by the OECD in partnership with the New South Wales Department of Customer Service, aims to make governments more effective and equitable worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Understanding Sludge

The term "sludge" was coined by Professor Cass Sunstein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> and refers to "unnecessary frictions" that block access, impose psychological costs, and erode trust when engaging with public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. It is often the "bad brother" of a "nudge," which aims to make services easier to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. While the concept of sludge is relatively new, the burdens it describes are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Common examples of sludge in government services include:
*   Information that is hard to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   Processes that are hard to understand or complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   Very long waiting times without updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   Complex decision points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

Often, sludge in government is unintentional; public servants do not deliberately add frictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### Psychological Costs of Sludge

A key aspect of sludge is its emphasis on psychological costs, which can be challenging to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. These costs include:
*   **Search costs:** Occur when people struggle to find information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Decision costs:** Experienced when evaluating complex options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Cognitive costs:** The mental resources expended in fulfilling requirements or understanding complex information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, often referred to as "brain capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   **Emotional costs:** Including stigma, loss of autonomy, stress, disempowerment, anxiety, or frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

These psychological costs disproportionately impact vulnerable populations, including vulnerable groups or individuals experiencing difficult life circumstances like natural disasters or childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Removing sludge is seen as a crucial way to promote inclusiveness, equity, and public perception of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

From a behavioral science perspective, sludge is particularly insistent due to human biases such as unrealistic optimism, procrastination, and present bias, which can lead individuals to delay or avoid navigating complex processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>. Additionally, cognitive scarcity experienced by people who are ill, poor, or struggling makes sludge especially challenging to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>.

## Sludge Audits as a Solution

Sludge audits provide [[tools_and_methodologies_for_sludge_audits | tools and methodologies]] to identify and address frictions in government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. They go beyond administrative efficiency, aiming to reshape public services to be more equitable, accessible, and trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. By focusing on human behaviors, drivers, and barriers, sludge audits bring together perspectives on administrative simplification and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

The OECD has placed trust at the center of its "Reinforcing Democracy Initiative" since 2021, recognizing that people's experiences with government services influence their perception of responsiveness and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Surveys reveal that less than four in ten respondents believe complaining about a poorly performing service would lead to improvement, highlighting the need to address daily interactions between citizens and public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### The New South Wales Sludge Audit Method

The New South Wales Department of Customer Service has developed a sludge audit method over four years, which has been tested in nearly 100 audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. This method is unique for its focus on quantifying the psychological aspects of burden and integrating behavioral science evidence with customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

Key metrics in the New South Wales method include:
*   **Time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>
*   **Cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>
*   **Effort** (unique focus on psychological costs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>
*   **Inclusion** (unique focus on equity aspects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>

The method involves seven steps, including a "Sludge Finder" web tool and toolkit, which have been improved to cater to nonlinear user journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

### The First International Sludge Academy

In 2022, the OECD's Behavioral Science team launched the first International Sludge Academy, piloting the New South Wales methodology outside Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. Sixteen teams from 14 countries participated, conducting sludge audits in parallel after attending masterclasses and receiving one-on-one mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

This initiative confirmed a global desire to reduce sludge and allowed for the auditing of diverse public services, including citizen-facing services (e.g., France, Brazil) and internal government processes (e.g., Canada, Australia federal level HR services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

### Case Studies and Learnings

The International Sludge Academy yielded significant lessons and led to the identification of nine good practice principles for assessing and preventing sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. Key takeaways include:

*   **Controllable Processes:** Teams should focus on aspects of processes they can control, with a clear line of sight between the audit and implementation of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Quantified data from audits can be compelling for making a business case for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
*   **Common Methodology:** A predefined, tested methodology ensures rigor and allows for replication and comparison across different contexts and countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   **Tailoring to Context:** Audits should accommodate complicated behavioral journeys, especially non-linear government services, and ensure an "equity lens" is applied throughout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.
*   **Evaluating Progress:** Sludge audits are valuable when they translate into on-the-ground changes, with teams committed to re-auditing services to measure impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:51">[0:26:51]</a>.
*   **System Enablers:** A government committed to improving user services, close connection to service owners, and systematic customer survey data are crucial enablers for successful sludge prevention programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

#### Testimonials from Participating Countries

*   **France (APA - Assistance for Independent Living):** The French behavioral insights team, which previously focused on simplification, used the sludge audit to systemize their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. They audited the application process for aid enabling elderly people to stay at home, which had high abandonment rates due to complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. The audit involved interviewing 20 people across nine departments (caregivers, applicants, professionals) and reviewing forms, focusing on time, effort, and psychological costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. This user-centric approach allowed for objective, multi-dimensional analysis, prioritizing problematic areas beyond just language simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. Challenges included lack of objective data and the question of dedicated full-time positions versus training administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.
*   **Brazil (Recovery of Gov.br Account):** Brazil audited the account recovery process for `gov.br`, the main entrance to over 4,000 [[digitalization_of_government_services | digital government services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. While automated recovery is well-designed, vulnerable users often face a more costly and difficult online form process for millions of annual requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. Brazil is developing its own adapted sludge audit tool, emphasizing a systematic approach and recognizing different user journeys, particularly for vulnerable groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:39:37">[0:39:37]</a>. The aim is to create a self-applied tool for federal, state, and municipal governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:40:28">[0:40:28]</a>. Sludge audits are seen as a good entry point for behavioral insights in government, though a more positive label for "audit" might be needed in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:40:56">[0:40:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:41:33">[0:41:33]</a>.

## Future Directions

The success of the first International Sludge Academy has prompted plans for a second iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:43:39">[0:43:39]</a>. This next phase will:
*   Cater to diverse team needs, including independent audits and advanced methodological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:42:47">[0:42:47]</a>.
*   Emphasize peer learning and knowledge sharing within the growing community of teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:43:47">[0:43:47]</a>.
*   Open participation to a broader set of teams beyond just behavioral science, including program, policy delivery, and service delivery teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:43:21">[0:43:21]</a>.
*   Involve the OECD in publications, research, and inviting experts from fields like customer experience and [[data_governance_for_public_sector_innovation | data science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:44:04">[0:44:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:44:20">[0:44:20]</a>.
*   Explore international benchmarking for shared processes like passport renewal to identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:44:37">[0:44:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:44:50">[0:44:50]</a>.

This work contributes to [[international_collaboration_on_sludge_reduction | international collaboration on sludge reduction]] and the development of an OECD recommendation on human-centered public administrative services, an international standard currently open for public consultation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. The goal is to maximize the collective leverage of international partnerships to build an evidence base and understanding of global best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

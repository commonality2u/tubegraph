The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need for a systemic approach to governance and policymaking. A webinar hosted by OPSI (Observatory of Public Sector Innovation) brought together experts to discuss how [[systems_thinking_and_anticipatory_innovation_governance | systems thinking]] can be applied to address the complex challenges and emerging vulnerabilities revealed by the crisis, and how governments can prepare for future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The COVID-19 Crisis as a Systemic Shock

The COVID-19 pandemic is widely considered a systemic shock with deep and long-term consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. It has not so much changed global long-term trends, but rather brutally accelerated them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. The crisis has exposed existing vulnerabilities and triggered new needs, revealing the growing inadequacy of prevailing policy directions and underlying systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

> [!info] A Crisis of Flawed Governance
> The COVID-19 crisis is not merely a pandemic crisis, but one that emerged because COVID-19 exploited a flawed system of public governance that is not aligned with its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. It is a symptom of much deeper underlying issues, such as increasing inequality and the ecological footprint of our planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.

The crisis has brought to the forefront significant inequalities, with COVID-19 prevalence aligning with areas of high unemployment and immigrant populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. In the US, for example, racial disparities in death rates highlight systemic issues inextricably bound to movements like Black Lives Matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.

## Government Responses and Challenges

Government responses have varied, with some aiming to return to "normal" and others seeking to use the crisis as an opportunity for sustainable transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Many governments initially took emergency measures constrained by pre-pandemic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Despite the urgent need for adaptive responses, traditional linear thinking often prevails in policymaking, driven by a desire for quick impacts and visible results before elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>. This contrasts with the reality that complex issues require systemic understanding and long-term strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.

> [!warning] Austerity on the Horizon
> A significant challenge facing governments is the impending reality of austerity, with potentially 25-50% budget gaps after the crisis due to dwindling tax revenues, higher unemployment, and rising healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. This necessitates a shift from "cut to save" to "cut to invest" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.

Examples from Finland highlight the limitations of past [[preparing_governments_for_future_challenges | preparedness strategies]]. A 2008 pandemic plan was outdated and unused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>, and strategic reserves had expired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. Furthermore, a lack of integrated working between different government agencies at borders meant directives did not translate into effective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

## Towards Systemic Change: Tools and Approaches

The crisis presents a [[system_thinking_and_transformative_change | window of opportunity]] to do things differently and embrace a paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. This requires institutions to evolve and remain relevant by aligning with emerging worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

### Foresight and Identifying Leverage Points
The EU Policy Lab has developed a pragmatic tool called the "Complex System Analyzer," a two-day workshop designed to help identify key leverage points in complex systems and connect them to a future vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. This tool, based on Donella Meadows' work, aims to make the complex intuitive and facilitate adaptation to new conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

### Building Systemic Capacity: The UK Policy Lab Approach
The UK Policy Lab has built a toolkit called "Government as a System" to work more systemically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. This toolkit considers the roles of individuals, communities, and government, demystifying the various ways government can act, from legislating and funding to collaborating and enabling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. It has expanded to include 56 actions mapping local, regional, national, and [[international_collaboration_during_crises | international government action]] to address large systemic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

The Policy Lab advocates for:
*   **Strategic Management:** Viewing policy progression as a series of experiments that, when combined, can lead to a paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
*   **Speculative Design:** Thinking about the future in new ways to expand the "Overton Window" and make previously unthinkable ideas possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>.
*   **Regenerative Public Services:** Shifting from a "doing things right" bureaucracy to "doing the right things," emphasizing allocative efficiency over technical efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Mindset:** Understanding that problems and solutions will emerge together, requiring flexibility and continuous adjustment based on new data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

### Rethinking Regulation and Trust in Society: The Netherlands Crisis Lab
Observations from Europe show that government inspections and regulation largely halted during the crisis, yet society did not collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. This suggests that a significant portion of regulations may not be essential or correspond with positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

The crisis provides an opportunity to shift responsibility for controlling and inspecting regulation from governments to actors within society, coupled with legal liability and mandatory insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. This requires governments to "take a step down" and trust society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. Barriers to this [[the_role_of_public_sector_innovation_in_crisis_response | systemic change]] include government's reluctance to relinquish control and the institutional inertia of regulatory bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.

### The Need for Real-Time Learning and Adaptive Mindsets
To prepare for future waves or cascading effects of the crisis, governments need to:
*   **Integrate Learning Teams:** Place learning mechanisms at the core of government and on the frontlines to capture real-time lessons and integrate external expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>.
*   **Embrace New Capacities:** Be open to "mergers and acquisitions" of talent and ideas from outside government, especially during times of crisis when internal capacity is stretched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.
*   **Reimagine Preparedness:** Shift from a linear, industrial way of thinking about preparedness to one that builds [[resilience_and_agility_in_government | adaptive capacity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.
*   **Develop Inclusive Exit Strategies:** Create recovery plans that are broad, socially engaged, and creative, avoiding decision-making by homogenous groups that don't represent the full diversity of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.

## Conclusion: Seizing the Opportunity for Transformation

The current moment offers a great opportunity for [[the_role_of_public_sector_innovation_in_crisis_response | innovation]] and [[system_thinking_and_transformative_change | systemic change]] in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>. Instead of merely bouncing back, governments can use this period to reform and rethink their approaches, building new capabilities and engaging a broader range of citizens and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:44">[01:29:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:58">[01:29:58]</a>. The ultimate measure of success in this crisis will be how much governments learn and whether they demonstrate the ability to absorb and transform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.

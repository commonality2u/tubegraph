The Observatory of Public Sector [[innovation in government | Innovation]] at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has developed a new model for public sector [[innovation in government | innovation]]. This model proposes that governments require distinct [[strategies for fostering government innovation | strategies]] to effectively foster and advance [[innovation in government | innovation]] within their countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The OECD's New Model of Public Sector Innovation

The OECD's model identifies four primary types of [[innovation in government | innovation]]:
*   Mission-oriented [[innovation in government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Adaptive [[innovation in government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   Anticipatory [[innovation in government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Enhancement-oriented [[innovation in government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

These categories are defined by two key variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>:
1.  **Purpose or Direction**: Whether the [[innovation in government | innovation]] has a clear purpose or direction, or if a discovery process is its core variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  **Uncertainty**: The level of uncertainty or certainty associated with the processes connected to the [[innovation in government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Tailoring Support Systems and Strategies

The OECD argues that different types of [[innovation in government | innovation]] necessitate distinct activities and support systems within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This implies that to boost and promote [[innovation in government | innovation]], governments need various [[innovation strategies in government | strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Innovation Portfolios
Ultimately, governments should manage "innovation portfolios" that include a balance of all different types of [[innovation in government | innovation]]. This balance should be formatted to align with the future goals of the government itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This approach contributes to the overall [[role of governments in fostering innovation | role of governments in fostering innovation]] and their [[role of governments in innovation and future planning | role in future planning]].

Specific needs for each innovation type include:
*   **Anticipatory Innovation** requires more autonomy than enhancement-oriented [[innovation in government | innovation]], as anticipation of future technological developments often challenges the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented Innovation** needs clear goals and targets to encourage people to work across silos and achieve government objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Innovation** necessitates a "license to explore" and discover new ideas and topics that could be useful or transform the system in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Managing these diverse innovation portfolios is an ongoing area of engagement for the Observatory of Public Sector [[innovation in government | Innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The goal is for governments to create, manage, and steward these [[strategies for fostering government innovation | strategies]] to develop optimal solutions for their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, fulfilling key [[reasons for government innovation | reasons for government innovation]].

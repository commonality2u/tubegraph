The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered public administration globally, revealing a transformative movement within the public sector and testing governments' ability to adapt to changing demands and expectations of their roles in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. This period served as a "global case study of adaptive innovation" within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>.

## Key Shifts and Impacts

### Acceleration of Digital Services
The pandemic led to an increased delivery of digital services by governments worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. There was a notable shift towards digital solutions, as evidenced by Portugal's experience where the "Simplex" program, an innovation and modernization initiative, was used as a privileged tool for adaptive response to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. In just a few weeks in 2020, Portugal released a package of about 200 measures in response to the pandemic, based on broad interaction with citizens, companies, civil society, and public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Increased Collaboration and Remote Work
Governments saw accelerated collaborative processes, boosted productivity, and the massive adoption of remote working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This included putting in place innovative and brand-new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Emphasis on Adaptive Innovation
The crisis highlighted that innovation strategies are stressed by unexpected contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The ability to anticipate, plan, systematically improve, and work towards concrete outcomes became crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. [[innovative_government_responses_to_the_crisis | Adaptive innovation]] became an important component of a comprehensive [[public_sector_innovation_in_response_to_covid19 | public sector innovation]] portfolio, especially given new demands in a rapidly changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>. It involves testing new approaches to respond to changing operating environments driven by new knowledge or the introduction of innovations by others, such as new technology or crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. This bottom-up, experimentation-driven approach is seen as crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>.

### Impact on Citizen Trust and Participation
[[impact_of_covid19_on_government_and_citizen_relations | Failure to respond effectively to new demands during the pandemic]] can further erode public trust in institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>. Similarly, a failure to include citizens in how responses happen can erode civic participation and reinforce perceptions of inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>. In an era of misinformation, governments must support more proactive citizen participation and inclusion efforts and be open to changing themselves in response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:25">[01:11:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

### Revealing Structural Inequalities and Challenges
The crisis revealed deeper issues such as structural inequalities, inadequate health systems, social protection gaps, digital divides, and unequal access to education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:11">[01:48:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:22">[01:48:22]</a>. It also highlighted issues like racial discrimination and violence against women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:29">[01:48:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:35">[01:48:35]</a>.

### The Challenge of Misinformation
Governments faced a significant challenge from the "infodemic" â€“ a large amount of information, often including disinformation, that undermined trust in governance and democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:46">[01:48:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:10">[01:49:10]</a>. Efforts to debunk misinformation and fact-check faced an uphill struggle, which will continue for years to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>. Some countries even took "too decisive actions" against disinformation, criminalizing the alleged spread of fake news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:26">[01:49:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:33">[01:49:33]</a>.

## Post-Pandemic Outlook and Future Preparedness

As governments transition from crisis response to recovery, a key question is what changes to keep and what to leave behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:29]</a>. Proactively supporting adaptive innovation activities will prepare governments for future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>. This requires:
*   A fundamental rethinking of governance structures, including how impact is measured and evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:42">[01:22:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a>.
*   Creating space for bottom-up experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>.
*   Engaging with citizens to co-create solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>.
*   Policymakers and public sector leaders learning and responding to new voices asking for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:03">[01:23:03]</a>.

The goal is not just "doing things differently, but doing different things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a>. Building sustained capacity for adaptive public innovation will prepare governments for future crises and ongoing global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:18">[01:30:18]</a>.

[!NOTE] The pandemic demonstrated the crucial need for governments to:
*   Become more digital, agile, and inclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   Encourage cross-sectoral collaboration, knowledge sharing, and diverse perspectives to develop a broad innovation ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   Embed civic participation and principles of open administration into public innovation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   Adopt a human-rights-based approach in the design, delivery, and evaluation of public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

The experience of the pandemic, while challenging, has provided an opportunity to reflect on and strengthen public administrations for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:53">[01:32:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:57">[01:32:57]</a>. The shift in people's mindsets, particularly after the crisis, supports the possibility of implementing more agile governance concepts across all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:53">[01:32:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:01">[01:33:01]</a>.

[[Innovation in the public sector | Managing innovation in the public sector]] through ecosystems and [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | portfolios]] is a key part of recovery work following global crises, which have exposed gaps where more or different types of [[Innovation in the public sector | innovation]] are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These crises have also highlighted the crucial role public sector organizations can play in shaping innovation efforts within ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Distinguishing Public Sector Innovation Portfolios

While "portfolio management" can mean different things, particularly in financial sectors, this discussion specifically focuses on [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation portfolios]] in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A key distinction from private sector [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation portfolios]] is that private sector portfolios often have a single underlying bottom line, making direction setting clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. In contrast, public sector returns on impact are notoriously difficult to measure and evaluate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## The Innovation Facet Model

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, supported by the European Commission, works with [[Innovation Portfolio Management in Public Sector | innovation portfolios]] using its Innovation Facet Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This model distinguishes different purposes of [[Innovation in the public sector | innovation]]:
*   **Directed, Mission-Oriented Innovation** Addressing societal-level challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory Innovation** Involving detecting and shaping trends as they emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Innovation** Generating bottom-up solutions through experimentation and openness to external drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation** Focusing on finding efficiencies and continuous improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

This is not the only framework for analysis, and other approaches exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Research and Application Levels

Research on [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation portfolios]] has been conducted at various levels:
*   Regional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   City level, and even cross-city levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>
*   Mission-level portfolios involving multi-sector ecosystems focused on a single goal (e.g., carbon neutrality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   Advising governments providing official development assistance to low and middle-income countries on how [[Innovation in the public sector | innovation]] can be supported and managed through [[portfolio exploration for public sector innovation | portfolio approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Through action research, different [[portfolio exploration for public sector innovation | portfolio approaches]] have been tested to help make sense of and connect disparate efforts, bringing intentionality to [[Innovation in the public sector | innovation]] so it serves the important work of governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Key Discoveries in [[Innovation Portfolio Management in Public Sector]]

The practice of [[Innovation Portfolio Management in Public Sector | innovation portfolio management]] is still emerging, but preliminary findings from the Observatory's research include:
*   **Mapping Generates Insights** The very act of collectively mapping an [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation portfolio]] generates insights, "aha moments," and collective intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Mapping is a Prompt for Action** Just mapping is not enough; the portfolio is meant to prompt collective interrogation and direction setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Analysis needs to lead to action, or it remains just a "pretty visual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Sustained Activity** Portfolio mapping and direction setting is not a one-time activity but must be sustained with dedicated capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Human Element** Portfolios are created and managed by humans in organizations, each with their own interests and logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. For portfolios to drive [[Innovation in the public sector | innovation]] holistically and systemically, the public sector's role in the ecosystem of actors must be clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Initial Panelist Perspectives on Portfolio Approaches

Expert panelists shared their views on how [[portfolio exploration for public sector innovation | portfolio approaches]] support public sector efforts:

*   **Coherence and Complexity** Kirsten Dunlop emphasizes the relevance of portfolios and coherence in addressing the complex change and transformation challenges faced by public sector bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Portfolios are effective mechanisms for handling extreme uncertainty driven by complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, allowing for accelerated learning and the deliberate deployment of [[Innovation in the public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. They facilitate co-development and involvement of local actors beyond mere consultation, creating decision bases for policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Opening Options and Systemic Learning** Giulio Coletto notes that traditional planning tools were exposed during the pandemic, designed for predictability, not complexity and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Portfolios are not magic tools but create a space where the frustration with unsuitable tools (like log frames or five-year plans) can surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. They open up new ways to make decisions, acting as a multiplier by allowing for learning, openness to not knowing, and engagement with stakeholders, unleashing the potential for systems to learn and create new options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Observing and Contextualizing** Alessandro Rancati highlights that asking for examples and ideas from the public creates a space for building portfolios, and the undirected results often reveal unexpected insights and blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This approach shows how different solutions can emerge and be viable, even contradictory ones, underscoring the importance of being contextual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. It's about observing, making sense of what's seen, and approaching the future together by understanding "what can we do next together to get out of it" rather than rigid long-term plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

## Poll Results on Facilitating Elements

A poll asked participants about the most important facilitating element for successful [[portfolio exploration for public sector innovation | portfolio approaches]] to [[Innovation in the public sector | innovation]]:
*   **Looking for relationships, connections, and combinations among diverse innovation initiatives** was the most popular response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
*   **Recognition of complexity and uncertainty in addressing change** tied for second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   **Keeping options open in order to iterate and learn** also tied for second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

Panelists reflected that these topics are interconnected and elements of the same whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The results are reassuring, showing a strong recognition of handling complex problems where "not knowing is a reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. The desire to work with systemic thinking to deal with complex adaptive system challenges shows coherency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Giulio notes that the popularity of "everything is connected" reflects the current zeitgeist, especially post-COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Alessandro highlights that recognizing uncertainty and keeping options open are essentially the same: it means not committing too early and being prepared to adapt, which is challenging in policy environments due to cultural resistance to changing decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

## Balancing Portfolios in the Public Sector

Given the complexities of public sector work, which differs from the private sector's financial bottom line, introducing [[portfolio exploration for public sector innovation | portfolio approaches]] requires specific considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. Public sector risk includes programmatic and reputational aspects, not just fiduciary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>, and "organizational dark matter" like habits and culture also influence outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

### Practical Application and Helpful Elements
A portfolio approach involves deploying many different [[Innovation in the public sector | innovations]] simultaneously in connected ways, chosen for their diversity and relationship to an overarching intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. For example, working with a city to decarbonize and build climate resilience by 2030 means understanding how to address various social, economic, infrastructure, and environmental systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. This could involve 100-300 innovation initiatives across different intervention points (e.g., water treatment, digital infrastructure, participatory energy ownership) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

Helpful elements in introducing this approach in a public sector context include:
1.  **Recognizing the Implementation Gap** Securing recognition of the "huge gulf" between policy commitments and individual innovations, and that joining up diverse interventions requires sustained, systematic work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.
2.  **Agreeing on Intent, Not Just Objectives** Working to agree on a common, shared commitment and vision for transformation, acknowledging that the destination is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. This means learning by doing and agreeing on intent with sufficient actors, sometimes even converting it into city law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>.
3.  **Creating a Visual and Systemic Frame** Constructing a frame that is visual, contextual, and systemic enough to help people see how different initiatives (e.g., transport, community gardens, aging population) relate within one whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>. This requires deliberate work to resist the "gravitational pull" of immediate solutions and deliverables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
4.  **Building Budgets of Flexibility** Deliberately creating spaces for possibility and flexibility, legitimizing the idea that complexity is a feature, not a bug, which can unleash greater engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.
5.  **Sense-Making and Learning** A portfolio approach truly comes to life when associated with sense-making, extracting learning from diverse initiatives, and understanding the relationships between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. This requires disciplined practice in reflection and turning interrogations into actionable intelligence and decision support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

## Funding Innovation Portfolios

Finding forms of [[Innovation in public sector management | innovation funding]] suited for [[portfolio exploration for public sector innovation | innovation portfolio approaches]] is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. In situations with rising debt and reduced resources (e.g., in the development sector), the natural reaction is often to demand more accountability and restriction, which goes against the openness needed for portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.

*   **Challenges in Funding** Public and private money often still looks for individual projects and bankable assets, leading to incremental work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. The structural challenge is that a portfolio works when funding can be pooled across different systems and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>. Technical solutions for pooling funds from multiple ministries are often not in place, and public procurement structures are not designed for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.
*   **Two Stages of Portfolios** A portfolio needs to be able to:
    1.  Pull funds with agility and freedom to distribute them as grants into multiple initiatives, accelerating learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
    2.  Pull through investable options as a result of the portfolio itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.
*   **"Transformational Capital"** Initiatives like "Mayors for Growth" and blueprints for "system financing" are testing how to finance portfolios rather than individual projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. This involves designing investment vehicles to enable investment directly in the portfolio's capacity to induce effects, rather than specific projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Such an approach can make it easier to unlock funding, especially when combining recovery funds with philanthropic capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>.
*   **Importance of Narratives and Qualitative Outcomes** When dealing with funding, the focus should also be on narratives and connecting with the final public or beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. This involves understanding perceptions, stories, and experiences related to projects, using qualitative methods to learn, improve, and understand where to focus next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. The goal is to be relevant for different contexts, not just representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.

## The Role of Portfolio Stewardship

The role of a public sector [[Innovation in public sector management | innovation portfolio]] manager or steward is still emerging and differs significantly from a traditional project manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.

### Key Attributes of a Portfolio Steward
A portfolio manager is more like a "gardener" or an "orchestrator" in a jazz orchestra, someone who provides initial input and allows others to build on it, rather than a strict director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. This role involves being an "editor," able to combine, connect, and understand relationships between initiatives to create coherence and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.

### Differentiating from Traditional Planning
A core difference is the ability to clearly differentiate between project objectives and overarching intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. Traditional planning jumps to defining destinations (e.g., "reduce poverty by 20%"), while portfolios are comfortable with broader overall directions, adapting as things change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. This shift in thinking also questions the organization's identity: it's no longer just a "solution provider" but a facilitator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. Creating shared mental models through discussion and social processes is crucial, as this cannot be achieved by a consultant's report alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.

### Addressing the "Innovation Unit" Challenge
A common challenge is that [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation units]] are created to change others but show limited willingness to challenge their own ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>. This is often a problem of roles and culture, as introducing new cultures (e.g., design into policymaking) is difficult and takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. To avoid this, some cities create "labs" that act as bridges between public administrations and citizens or other ways of talking, fostering productive conversations between different cultures that might otherwise not understand each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>. The focus needs to be practical—on "what do we do next" rather than formal exercises that lack substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>.

## Ecosystem Approach and the Public Sector's Role

Facing society-wide challenges, unilateral action by a single administration is no longer sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>. Governments are ultimately held responsible but need to work within an ecosystem of actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

*   **Coherence between Problem and Solution** The problems requiring fundamental structural change in ways of living demand approaches that are coherent with that scale and reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>. This means designing for ecosystems and working with multiple actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>.
*   **Governments as Ecosystem Representatives** Governments are a representation of how societies are structured, and they need to enable public bodies to embrace roles like:
    *   **Challenge Owners** Holding accountability over political cycles and generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>.
    *   **Orchestrators** Proficient at joining dots, bridging, convening, and facilitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>.
    *   **Activists and Advocates** Representing multiple interests that need to be braided into systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>.
*   **Embracing Radical Collaboration and Technology** A shared mental model and a vision that can mobilize multiple entities are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>. This requires designing for and rewarding "radical collaboration" as an explicit requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. Furthermore, technology, particularly AI, should be used to help look across relationships and foster this collaboration, rather than contributing to siloed effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>. These are essential components for the public sector to steer transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
The discussion highlighted that [[Innovation Portfolio Management in Public Sector]] is an emerging practice that shifts from decision support to learning support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>, encourages not rushing to the first solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>, emphasizes narrative and intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>, and operates within existing organizational logics to introduce new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

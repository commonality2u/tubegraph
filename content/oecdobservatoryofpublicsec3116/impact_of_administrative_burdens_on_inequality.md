[[Administrative Burdens in Citizens and Government Interactions | Administrative burdens]] are defined as the negative interactions people have with government, or "frictions" they experience when trying to access public services or benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:07">[03:59:07]</a>. These burdens can significantly limit access to public services and reinforce existing patterns of [[addressing_inequality_and_inclusion_in_governance | inequality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.

There are three main types of administrative costs identified in this framework:
*   **Learning Costs** The process of searching for and collecting information about public services and their relevance to an individual, such as eligibility requirements for health insurance or a driver's license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:07">[04:30:07]</a>. An example is the complex navigation of the US Medicare system, which is a hybrid of public and private insurance, requiring difficult choices with significant consequences for access to healthcare and financial costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:07">[05:11:07]</a>.
*   **Compliance Costs** These are the costs associated with following rules and requirements, including paperwork, waiting times, fees, and providing documentation to prove eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:07">[06:12:07]</a>. An example is the annual renewal process for Medicaid in the US, where many people lose coverage due to procedural reasons, leading to "churn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:07">[07:27:07]</a>.
*   **Psychological Costs** Beyond stigma, these include stress, loss of autonomy, frustration, and even fear that people experience when navigating public processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:07">[08:34:07]</a>. These costs can significantly impact people's trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:07">[09:37:07]</a>. An academic recounts her niece's struggle to access food stamps during the pandemic, highlighting the frustration and fear involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:07">[09:55:07]</a>.

## How Burdens Reinforce Inequality

Existing research highlights several ways administrative burdens exacerbate [[addressing_inequality_and_inclusion_in_governance | inequality]]:
*   **Small Burdens, Large Impacts** Seemingly minor hurdles can have significant consequences. For instance, in a US student loan forgiveness program, simply having the loan provider fill out the form for the applicant (requiring only a signature and email back) drastically increased application rates from 24% to 60%, leading to an average monthly payment difference of $125 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:07">[12:02:07]</a>. This demonstrates how even minor barriers can prevent eligible individuals from accessing beneficial programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:07">[13:19:07]</a>.
*   **Disadvantaged Populations Affected Most** The people who most need help are often the least equipped to navigate complex systems due to factors like language barriers, illness, cognitive disabilities, or lack of time and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:07">[13:52:07]</a>.
*   **Performance Under Scarcity and Stress** Cognitive and psychological research shows that individuals perform less well under conditions of scarcity, stress, or poor health, which are precisely the conditions many needing public assistance face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:07">[14:29:07]</a>.
*   **Disparate Program Design** In contexts like the US, programs targeted at middle-class individuals (e.g., health insurance subsidies) are often easy to navigate, with employers handling administrative tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:07">[14:53:07]</a>. Conversely, programs for low-income populations (e.g., Medicaid) are frequently complex and burdensome, requiring more effort to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:07">[15:23:07]</a>. This means those with fewer resources are more likely to encounter complicated government programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:07">[15:30:07]</a>.

## Reducing Burdens and Promoting Equity

### Automatic Renewal (Ex-Parte)
The most effective way to reduce burdens is through automatic renewal processes, shifting the administrative load from individuals to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:07">[16:03:07]</a>. This approach aims to get as close as possible to automated processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:07">[16:16:07]</a>.

*   **Medicaid Example (US)** The [[biden_administration_initiatives_to_reduce_administrative_burdens | Biden Administration]] has pushed US states to expand automatic renewal for Medicaid. This policy, known as "ex-parte," allows states to renew eligibility using existing data without requiring individuals to resubmit paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:07">[21:22:07]</a>. Nationally, the automatic renewal rate for Medicaid increased from about 25% to nearly 50% between 2023 and 2024, significantly reducing burdens for millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:07">[22:30:07]</a>.
*   **Minnesota Case Study** In Minnesota, a project with Code for America (a non-profit civic tech firm) expanded automatic renewal for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled population, a vulnerable group often struggling with paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:07">[23:17:07]</a>. By helping the state organize and connect administrative data for case workers, the renewal rate for this population rose from approximately 40% to 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:07">[24:46:07]</a>. This intervention specifically helped non-white families, especially Black families, whose enrollment rates were historically lower than average, demonstrating how automatic renewal can "level the playing field" and reduce inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:18:07">[25:18:07]</a>.
*   **US Digital Service Intervention** The US Digital Service (USDS), an internal civic tech organization, deployed "tiger teams" to states to help improve Medicaid renewal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:07">[26:13:07]</a>. These teams provided technical expertise (identifying data sources, checking code) and policy capacity (clarifying flexibility in national policy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:07">[27:02:07]</a>. This intervention helped lower-performing states increase their automatic renewal rates to the national average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:07">[27:54:07]</a>.

### Role of Technology and Digitalization
[[Role of technology and digitalization in reducing administrative burdens | Technology]] is a powerful enabler for reducing burdens, especially when it leverages administrative data to shift burdens from the public to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:07">[32:25:07]</a>. However, [[artificial_intelligence_in_public_administration | automation]] and algorithms must be implemented carefully to avoid introducing new biases or failures that increase burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:33:07">[28:33:07]</a>.

*   **Risks of Automation** Cases in Australia and the Netherlands demonstrated that disproportionate focus on minimizing fraud, coupled with algorithms producing false positives and insufficient human oversight, led to significant negative consequences and increased burdens on citizens, even causing governments to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:07">[28:51:07]</a>. This highlights that [[role_of_technology_and_digitalization in_reducing_administrative_burdens | technology]] can be used to either increase or decrease burdens and should not be blindly trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:56:07">[48:56:07]</a>.
*   **Addressing Digital Inequality** When implementing [[role_of_technology_and_digitalization in_reducing_administrative_burdens | digitalization]], it's crucial to acknowledge the digital divide, particularly for older adults who may struggle with digital interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05:07">[48:05:07]</a>. A principle for governments is to create an "easy road" for the majority while reallocating resources to support those facing greater difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:07">[49:52:07]</a>.
*   **Privacy vs. Access** While privacy is a valid concern, particularly with [[artificial_intelligence_in_public_administration | automation]] and data sharing, government agencies may sometimes overvalue privacy relative to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:12:07">[58:12:07]</a>. Citizens often prefer easier access, expressing confusion as to why governments don't use their existing data to simplify processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:52:07">[58:52:07]</a>. A "do no harm" policy suggests that sharing data to benefit citizens intuitively makes sense, as opposed to using data to punish them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

## Measuring Burdens and [[Addressing Inequality and Inclusion in Governance | Addressing Inequality]]

Measuring administrative burdens, especially learning and psychological costs, is challenging, particularly for individuals who never initiate interaction with a program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:07">[35:19:07]</a>.
*   **Qualitative Methods** Initial understanding of psychological costs can be gained through qualitative methods, such as focus groups and interviews with community organizations and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:07">[36:05:07]</a>.
*   **Experimental Designs** Sophisticated randomized controlled trials can help identify the type of barrier encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:07">[37:45:07]</a>. For example, studies on the Earned Income Tax Credit showed that stigma did not reduce participation, while experiments with student support programs revealed that compliance costs, rather than learning costs, were the primary bottleneck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:07">[38:00:07]</a>.
*   **User Surveys** For those who engage with government programs, simple, short user surveys at every step can reveal patterns of how people respond to interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:02:07">[39:02:07]</a>. One key finding is that uncertainty creates a significant administrative burden; people who don't know the outcome of their application experience similar negative feelings to those whose applications were denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:47:07">[39:47:07]</a>.
*   **Trust in Government** While a single positive experience won't revolutionize trust, an accumulation of good experiences can matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:53:07">[44:53:07]</a>. Measuring trust should be done in a context logical to the user (e.g., trust in the specific agency interacted with) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:10:07">[45:10:07]</a>. Fear, particularly in immigrant communities, also significantly affects access to government benefits and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:20:07">[46:20:07]</a>.
*   **Geographical Variations** The type of burdens people face varies by geographic context. Rural areas may experience barriers due to lack of public transportation or reliable personal vehicles, while urban areas might face issues related to poor public infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:47:07">[46:47:07]</a>.

## Key Lessons for Governments

To successfully reduce burdens and address [[addressing_inequality_and_inclusion_in_governance | inequality]]:
*   **Culture Centered on the Public** Build a culture that prioritizes the public's experience of administrative processes, utilizing tools like human-centered design and journey mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:45:07">[30:45:07]</a>.
*   **Capacity Building** A change in practice requires dedicated customer experience staff whose primary role is to review existing processes and revise them based on public experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:08:07">[31:08:07]</a>.
*   **Collaboration** Redesigning processes often necessitates collaboration between multiple agencies, especially for data sharing to simplify eligibility verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:07">[31:36:07]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Processes** Governments are adept at adding new systems and rules but less so at reviewing whether existing ones are effective. Regular review of processes is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:07">[31:56:07]</a>.
*   **Technology as an Enabler (with caution)** [[Role of technology and digitalization in reducing administrative burdens | Technology]] can leverage administrative data to shift burdens from the public to the state. However, blind faith in [[artificial_intelligence_in_public_administration | technology]] can create blind spots, potentially increasing burdens and leading to worse outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:07">[32:25:07]</a>. Behavioral scientists can play a crucial role in emphasizing the importance of rigorous evaluation, as intuitive solutions may not always be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:07">[53:05:07]</a>.

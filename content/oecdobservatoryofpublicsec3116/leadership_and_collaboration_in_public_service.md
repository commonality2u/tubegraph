The "Government Aftershocks" series convened a global dialogue to discuss the crisis and its revelations about the role and expectations of government, with a particular focus on the future of public employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. A key aspect of this discussion centered on the evolving nature of [[leadership_and_teamwork_in_public_administration | leadership]] and [[Public sector innovation and crosssector collaboration | collaboration]] within public service.

## Impact of the Crisis
The crisis highlighted the critical role of the public service in meeting community needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. It revealed that public administration can be agile and responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. In Slovenia, the reputation of the civil service significantly increased due to its rapid provision of anti-coronal law packages and maintenance of critical infrastructure and economic support measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The crisis also shattered stereotypes of the public sector being rigid and slow to adapt, as exemplified by the overnight shift of nearly 70% of Slovenian civil servants to remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

A major takeaway from the crisis is that public services operate more effectively when they work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. There has been a significant increase in [[Public sector innovation and crosssector collaboration | cross-collaboration]] between agencies, government departments, and voluntary groups to support vulnerable communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This cooperative spirit is a testament to the flexibility, adaptability, and [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_leadership | innovative]] nature of public sector workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Lessons Learned for the Future
The pandemic demonstrated that public employees are essential to communities and societies, not merely bureaucrats defending privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. They proved highly flexible and skilled, often adapting to new ways of working and using their knowledge without adequate prior training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Key lessons learned include:
*   **The Power of Collaboration:** The crisis fostered an unprecedented level of [[Public sector innovation and crosssector collaboration | collaboration]] across agencies, which is normally challenging for large organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. The challenge now is to embed this collaborative way of working into the "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **People-Centricity:** Regardless of processes and structures, effective public service delivery relies on competent and capable people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Distributed [[Leadership and teamwork in public administration | Leadership]]:** There has been a significant growth in distributed leadership, requiring support and training for middle management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **[[Collaboration and governance in digital services | Digitalization]] and [[Skills for the future in the public sector | Skills]]:** The crisis underscored the importance of digital skills and technologies for public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, and that the public sector must become a [[Collaborative Learning and Innovation in Government | learning organization]] to keep pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Value of [[Collaboration and governance in digital services | Collective Bargaining]]:** [[Collaboration and governance in digital services | Collective bargaining]] proved to be a valuable tool for addressing problems and improving working conditions during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>.

## Developing Resilience and Future Skills
To enhance resilience in public workforces, an efficient use of digital technologies is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Investment in people and their skills, especially in becoming a [[Collaborative Learning and Innovation in Government | learning organization]], is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Key [[Skills for the future in the public sector | skills for the future]] include:
*   Critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>
*   Creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>
*   Judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>
*   Responsive [[Innovation in public service delivery | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>
*   The ability to continuously learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>

[[Leadership and teamwork in public administration | Managers]] and leaders need to develop learning agility, emotional intelligence, and the ability to manage through change and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. This includes cultivating "soft skills" like influencing, communicating, and bringing people along through change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. Foundational [[Skills for the future in the public sector | digital and data skills]] for all staff are also essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

Specific areas for development include:
*   [[Leadership and teamwork in public administration | Distributed leadership]] and support for middle management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   [[Leadership and teamwork in public administration | Leaders]] who are visible and focus on mental well-being and wellness for their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   [[Collaborative Learning and Innovation in Government | Communities of practice]] to foster learning and sharing of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
*   Managing the organization's risk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

Politically, there needs to be a collective will to invest in public services, avoiding cuts and understaffing that proved detrimental during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Political competition between different levels of government must be avoided as it hinders effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Rethinking Public Employment
The crisis presents significant opportunities to rethink public employment, especially regarding remote work and mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. While remote work has proven efficient, policies must be designed to maximize its benefits while mitigating risks like burnout and ensuring work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

Key considerations for the future:
*   **Flexible Work Models:** Designing job policies that combine remote and office work, defining which tasks are best performed in each setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. This requires a cultural shift in management towards building trust in employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.
*   **New Work Structures:** Exploring "public service hubs" closer to where people live, allowing for connection without extensive commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>.
*   **Workforce Mobility:** Developing a "surge reserve" of public servants who can be quickly mobilized to assist during future crises, leveraging skills across agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Governance:** Sustaining [[Public sector innovation and crosssector collaboration | collaboration]] will require embedding it into governance arrangements and organizational culture, aligning incentives with collaborative expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. [[Leadership and teamwork in public administration | Leaders]] must prioritize crisis management skills and effective communication with remote teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.
*   **Addressing Risks of Remote Work:** Ensuring fairness and proportionality in remote work opportunities to prevent senior or unburdened individuals from being the only beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. Concerns include disproportionate impact on women due to care burdens, lack of adequate home office space, and the risk of "out of sight, out of mind" for career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   **Investing in People:** Avoiding workforce reductions and pay cuts, as these were identified as past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. The focus should be on "flexibilities in terms of skills" and adapting competencies to community needs, rather than flexible employment contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.
*   **Changing the Narrative:** Shifting the perception of public administration from a cost to a vital investment, enhancing social recognition for public service workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
*   **Supporting Workers' Rights:** Ensuring that working conditions, whether in-office or remote, are regulated, and that workers have the right to organize and form unions, and engage in [[Collaboration and governance in digital services | collective bargaining]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

## Personal Commitments for the Future
Panelists expressed personal commitments to applying the lessons learned:
*   **Focus on People:** Prioritizing people in the civil service, including selecting the right individuals for the right positions and continuously supporting their adaptation and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>.
*   **Promoting Public Service Reputation:** Actively telling positive stories about the public service's contributions during the crisis to build recognition and counter misconceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
*   **Fostering Diversity and Well-being:** Ensuring diversity of thought and recognizing [[leadership_and_teamwork_in_public_administration | leadership]] from unexpected places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>. [[Leadership and teamwork in public administration | Leaders]] must also prioritize their own physical and mental well-being to lead by example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.
*   **Preparing for Instability:** Recognizing that instability can occur unpredictably (e.g., climate crisis, social unrest) and committing to equipping civil servants with the [[Skills for the future in the public sector | skills]] and capacity to respond to such multifaceted threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. This involves strengthening public administration structures and fostering cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>.

The overall sentiment from the forum's poll suggests optimism, with nearly half of respondents expecting a more flexible and resilient model of public sector employment, and 40% anticipating a more digitally savvy workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>. Crucially, almost no one believes things will return to how they were before the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.

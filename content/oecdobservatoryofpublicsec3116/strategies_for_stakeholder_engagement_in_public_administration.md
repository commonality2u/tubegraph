[[Collaborative approaches in public sector innovation | Co-creation]] with stakeholders is a critical method for building inclusive societies and addressing complex challenges in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This approach aims to develop more robust solutions and foster greater support for decisions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

## Defining Co-creation

Co-creation, in the context of public administration, involves engaging stakeholders in:
*   Identifying all dimensions of a problem or issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   Designing and implementing solutions through a "generative exchange of insights and ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

This approach goes beyond traditional methods like merely informing stakeholders of decisions or conducting online surveys for comments, which often result in a "series of monologues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. Co-creation encourages participants to come together, "talk and brush off their ideas and align around their path forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. It is viewed as a continuous process, essential for complex, evolving problem domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Importance and Benefits

[[Innovation in public administration | Co-creation]] is not merely a "nice" or "moral" practice; it's a fundamental necessity for managing complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Key benefits include:
*   **Optimal Results & Proper Decisions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Complexity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>: Central authorities often cannot fully comprehend or control complex systems due to informational problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Co-creation is the only viable way to tackle such complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Building Legitimacy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>: When departing from traditional policymaking, co-creation helps ensure ethical processes and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Legitimacy is constructed within the policy-making process itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   **Fostering Learning Capacity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>: It builds a "learning community" where every partner learns, which is fundamental to driving change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This learning experience is crucial for both participants and the administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Support and Buy-in**: Engaging stakeholders early prevents later obstruction of decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. The implementation phase becomes "so much more effective" once consensus is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   **Protection Against Lobbyists**: An open and transparent co-creation process ensures no secret meetings or backdoor deals, fostering "mutual policing of the lobby space" by all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Methods and Approaches

### General Principles
*   **Generative Exchange**: Facilitators aim for genuine dialogue where ideas are debated and refined to align on a path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Tailored Design**: Meetings are designed individually based on requirements and questions, often modifying approaches as the process unfolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Openness**: No secret meetings; everything is "out in the open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Open documentation of the process, learnings, and weekly notes allows for public challenge and input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Iterative Policy-making**: COVID-19 highlighted the need for agile, iterative policy processes that can adapt weekly based on data and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

### Specific Techniques
*   **Classic Participatory Methods**: Examples include World Cafe, Open Space Technology, and Circle Practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Some methods are developed specifically for certain settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Workshops, Hackathons, Design Sprints**: Used to find solutions for challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **User Journey Mapping**: Helps service users articulate problems and suggest improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Participatory Budgeting**: Allocating a portion of a public budget to a participatory process, actively recruiting diverse demographics for true representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Citizen Juries and Citizen Assemblies**: Used as key deliberative frameworks, integrating citizens directly into policy co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### Digital Tools
*   **CoGo Digital Toolkit**: A holistic tool to support public organizations in implementing co-creation at the service level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. It consists of four integrated tools:
    *   **CoRedi**: Assesses an organization's readiness for co-creation via a self-evaluation questionnaire, providing a roadmap for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
    *   **CoServe**: Helps identify which public service is most suitable for co-creation renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
    *   **CoNew**: Actively includes service users in the renewal process using user journey mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
    *   **CoMaster**: Assesses the quality of co-creation initiatives to identify areas for future improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

## Key Success Factors and Preconditions

Successful [[collaborative_approaches_in_public_sector_innovation | co-creation]] processes depend on several critical factors:

1.  **Political Backing and Clear Purpose**:
    *   Strong political support and momentum are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
    *   A clear purpose for the process, focused on the problem to be solved, rather than a predefined outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
    *   Senior leadership (Director Generals, Directors) must buy-in and be ready to step into the process and accept its outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

2.  **Skilled and Motivated People**:
    *   **Facilitation Expertise**: A highly skilled hosting team is needed to manage the process, along with an advanced secretariat to handle content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
    *   **"Holding Space" Capability**: This is a fundamentally different skill than traditional project management. It requires high emotional intelligence and social presence, often necessitating different recruitment strategies rather than just training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Public Official's Role**: Beyond hosting, public officials should provoke and challenge, ensuring the public interest is considered, even if it diverges from immediate community interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Autonomy and Discretion**: Staff need autonomy to act and a willingness to grant discretion to external stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Learning Mindset**: People must be open to new ideas, views, and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

3.  **[[Trust and engagement in public governance | Trust and Authenticity]]**:
    *   Building trust is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
    *   Authenticity in engagement: Officials must "say what you mean and mean what you say" and fully respect the process, not just gather input and then implement a predetermined solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

4.  **Systemic View and Ownership**:
    *   Recognize that problems often have no institutional boundaries, requiring a systemic, holistic, and "challenge-based system approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
    *   A committed project owner/sponsor with the mandate to design, deliver, and implement solutions in a co-creative manner is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Best results are seen when the project sponsor is from the state administration due to their mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

5.  **Implementation and Communication**:
    *   Clearly define concrete commitments, including responsible parties and deadlines for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
    *   Maintain constant two-way communication with all involved stakeholders about progress to foster continued cooperation and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges and strategies in implementing public sector innovation | Challenges and Pitfalls]]

Obstacles that hold back government authorities from fully embracing co-creation include:
*   **Hierarchical Mindset**: A prevalent top-down approach makes collaboration less comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Participatory Knowledge, Skills, and Tools**: Insufficient training in participatory methods, listening, and systems thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
*   **Time Consumption**: Co-creation can be time-consuming initially, though it yields significant long-term benefits in implementation and public acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Rigid Regulativ Frameworks**: Inflexible legislation, procurement procedures, or austerity measures can impede experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Internal Collaboration**: Public administrations may struggle to host external collaboration if internal practices are not collaborative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **Political Accountability**: A shift in politics is needed where politicians offer "generosity of space and the integrity of how the whole space" rather than just answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Budgeting Constraints**: Traditional public budget planning (e.g., two years in advance) makes agile, iterative policy changes difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
*   **Exclusion of Future Generations**: Current co-creation processes often fail to involve future generations, whose interests are significantly impacted by present decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Incumbent Bias/Interpretation**: Bureaucrats must avoid interpreting or re-framing participant outcomes, as this risks losing trust and de-naturing the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Examples from the Field

### Circular Plastics Alliance (European Commission)
*   **Goal**: Recycle 10 million tons of used plastic into new products annually by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.
*   **Approach**: Instead of legislating, the European Commission fostered an alliance by inviting members across the entire plastics value chain (chemical producers, product designers, consumers, waste collectors, recyclers, public authorities, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
*   **Process**: Began with CEOs of main industry and consumer groups, followed by 14 fully participatory working group meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Meetings were "scripted down to the minute" but participants felt complete freedom to discuss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. The focus was on building trust and generative exchange to create solutions collaboratively rather than competitively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>. This resulted in a declaration with 120 signatories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.
*   **Online Adaptation**: Moving online during COVID-19 was straightforward due to existing trust and relationships built from live meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. While informal interactions were lost, the online format significantly increased reach, involving people unable to travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>.

### innovative.si (Slovenian Ministry of Public Administration)
*   **Goal**: Creatively resolve complex social challenges and strengthen [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation culture]] by providing knowledge and competences for new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Approach**: Matches public sector challenges with internal/external facilitators to navigate co-creative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Public sector employees are part of the facilitation team to learn methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Emphasizes active user involvement from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Key Initiatives**:
    *   **Innovation Community Platform**: Established for networking, learning, support, and transferring good practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Holds monthly events and has grown to over 400 members from public, private, and academic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Innovative Ambassadors**: Individuals (currently 70) who act as active roles in the community and their workplaces, serving as entry points for co-creative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## [[Public sector innovation strategies | Future Considerations]] and Structural Changes

For co-creation to truly thrive and lead to fundamental societal transitions, deeper structural changes are needed:
*   **Rethinking Institutions and Democracy**: Co-creation calls for reimagining traditional institutional frameworks to enable more complex decision-making in an emerging world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. The ability of societies to make decisions together is seen as "fundamentally broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **[[experimental_approaches_in_public_administration | Embracing Uncertainty]] and "Care"**: Public administration needs to shift from a "control-oriented program" to one that can "hold uncertainty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. This requires institutionalizing "care" in how administration functions, dealing with open-ended questions and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Systemic Recruitment and Capability Rebalancing**: Instead of just training existing staff, governments should consider recruiting individuals with inherent "holding space" capabilities, emotional intelligence, and social presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Intergenerational Equity**: Crucially, future generations need to be involved in co-creation processes, as current decisions significantly impact them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Shifting from Consultation to Continuous Co-creation**: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted that traditional policy-making is too slow for "long emergencies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. The need for continuous, agile, and iterative policy development, where legitimacy is constructed in the process itself, points to a new "policy architecture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   **Unified View of Stakeholders and Citizens**: The distinction between "stakeholders" and "citizens" should blur, recognizing that "stakeholders are citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

Overall, [[innovative_approaches_to_public_governance | co-creation]] is viewed as a necessary evolution for public administration to effectively navigate complex, uncertain environments and build a society capable of making collective decisions for a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

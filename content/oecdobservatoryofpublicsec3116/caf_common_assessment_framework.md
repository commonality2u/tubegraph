The **Common Assessment Framework (CAF)** is a quality management tool designed for the public sector, aiming to foster innovation and improve regulation and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It is a self-assessment tool used by public administrations to enhance their overall performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The CAF model itself is subject to continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Core Principles and Interconnectedness

CAF emphasizes that quality and innovation are interconnected and should not be treated separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Research has proven that both processes are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. CAF helps organizations improve, set a different mindset, use collective knowledge, and embrace change by fostering continuous learning and a holistic approach to performance analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

The 2020 version of the CAF model explicitly includes innovation, mentioning the word 50 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. It is integrated into Principle 6: "Continued learning, innovation and improvement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. Criterion 2.4 specifically addresses managing change and innovation in an agile way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

## CAF's Role in Resilience and Crisis Response

The COVID-19 crisis highlighted the need for public administrations to be resilient and fit for future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. CAF has proven to be a significant aid for organizations in preparing for uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, and has emerged stronger after the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

An ongoing analysis, part of a [[cocreation_process_with_oecd | co-creation process with OECD]] and supported by the European Commission, is examining how organizations using CAF responded during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. The project aims to take stock of public sector resilience in the wake of COVID-19 and how the CAF model might evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>.

Key characteristics of resilient and innovative organizations identified by Deloitte's 2021 Global Resilience Report are embedded within the CAF model and its principles of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:25]</a>:
*   **Preparedness:** Having clear short- and long-term priorities and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Adaptability:** Utilizing an adaptable workforce with flexible teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Collaboration:** Increasing collaboration both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Trustworthiness:** Building trust between leaders and employees, and fostering transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Responsibility:** Adapting in response to crises beyond basic requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Public sector organizations need to focus on complex, multi-dimensional challenges, including restoring growth, protecting vulnerable populations, building a green economy, debt sustainability, and employment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>. CAF can help assess preparedness and strengthen resilience across dimensions like leadership, strategy, planning, human resources, partnerships, resources, and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

## Examples of CAF Implementation

### Vienna City Administration
The City of Vienna, with 1.9 million citizens and around 60,000 administration employees, has used CAF for almost 20 years, based on a mutual agreement between political and administrative levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>. They employ a "bunch of management methods" including [[common_assessment_framework_and_quality_management | ISO 9001]] and EFQM excellence models, with CAF blending in perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:43">[01:14:43]</a>.

CAF acts as a coach for organizational development and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>. Innovation requires a solid foundation and a basic perfection of organizational development, where it can thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>. CAF helps detect maturity levels and focuses on closing the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle to achieve higher maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. This systematic improvement leads to organizational fitness, agility, and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>. Small steps can make a huge impact in the journey for quality and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:34">[01:24:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:38">[01:24:38]</a>. CAF also serves as a "window to the world," enabling mutual exchange of experience and learning from other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:45">[01:22:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

### Kraków City Administration
Kraków City Office has been using CAF since 2011, conducting four self-assessments, each leading to improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:19">[02:27:19]</a>. The latest assessment in 2017 focused on improving communication with clients (citizens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:35">[02:27:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:53">[02:27:53]</a>.

Key communication improvements inspired by CAF:
*   **Taxpayer Portal (2018):** An electronic tool with an information platform on local taxes and fees, and a personalized channel for citizens to communicate with the office, check liabilities, launch declarations, and pay taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:09">[03:20:09]</a>. It has been a great success, reducing phone inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:28">[03:33:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:48">[03:38:48]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Official Language (2019):** Guidelines and training workshops were developed to help officials write and speak in a more understandable, inclusive language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:53">[03:49:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:02">[03:55:02]</a>.
*   **Parcel Lockers for City Services (2020):** Inspired partly by the COVID-19 crisis, this initiative allows citizens to receive physical documents (like license plates) via parcel lockers, offering 24/7 access and reducing queues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:21">[03:31:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:36">[03:37:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:11">[03:59:11]</a>.
*   **Integrated Contact Center (2021-2022):** A new unit designed to gather staff who can answer questions about various city services and municipal units, addressing issues of long phone queues and difficulty reaching officials during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:39">[03:38:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:01">[04:10:01]</a>.

CAF acted as a trigger that inspired these new ideas and focused management and staff attention on the area of communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:14">[04:33:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:57">[04:37:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:02">[04:49:02]</a>. The initial trigger for CAF implementation in Kraków was financial, with European Union funding for new management tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:50">[04:52:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:30">[04:53:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:37">[04:55:37]</a>.

### Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and Sports
After their first CAF self-assessment, the Ministry identified the need for an employee survey to understand employee satisfaction, organizational climate, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:01">[04:49:01]</a>. They collaborated with seven other public organizations to create a uniform methodology for a questionnaire called "Employee Eyes," allowing for comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:17">[04:49:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:19">[04:52:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:32">[04:53:32]</a>. This [[cocreation with stakeholders | collaborative initiative]] among CAF users on a national level proved beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:57">[04:53:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:08">[05:07:08]</a>.

The questionnaire's objectives included gaining insight into organizational function, obtaining information for strategic decisions, developing a uniform methodology, and identifying benefits and improvement opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:18">[05:20:18]</a>. The survey results are a strong management tool for strategic planning when used properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:08">[05:56:08]</a>.

## Impact on Human Resource Management

A poll conducted during the session revealed that participants consider [[human_resource_management_and_caf | Human Resource Management]] (HRM) to be the area most affected by the use of CAF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. A Slovenian study specifically measured a significant impact of CAF implementation on HRM and the "people" criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis highlighted weaknesses in HRM and the need to adapt working methods, including remote and hybrid models, which impact areas like knowledge management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. CAF can help organizations make step-by-step improvements in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.

## Conclusion

CAF acts as a framework for continuous improvement, innovation, and organizational resilience within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Its emphasis on self-assessment, learning, and collaboration has proved valuable in adapting to evolving challenges and fostering a culture of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a>.

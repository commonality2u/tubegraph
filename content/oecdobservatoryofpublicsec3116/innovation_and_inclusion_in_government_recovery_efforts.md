The International Conference on Governments Beyond Recovery and Towards a Future-Fit Public Sector, a virtual event hosted by the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU, the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, and the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA), with support from the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program, convened to explore opportunities for public governance as the world emerges from crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">00:00:01</a>. The conference aimed to explore how [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]], adaptation, strategic foresight, and co-creation can shape a better future for governments, societies, and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">00:00:47</a>.

## The Pandemic's Impact and Government Response
Governments faced significant challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic over the past year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">00:13:21</a>. Their bold and decisive responses were crucial in supporting businesses and households, and in saving lives and livelihoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">00:13:26</a>. This public support across the OECD, through increased spending, foregone taxes, and business loans, amounted to a massive 27% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">00:13:54</a>.

The [[economic_recovery_and_innovation | economic recovery]] is underway, with global growth projected to reach 5.7% this year and 4.5% next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">00:14:15</a>. This optimistic outlook is attributed to extensive policy support, rapid vaccine development, and accelerating digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">00:14:23</a>. However, the recovery remains uneven across countries and sectors, with new outbreaks posing the biggest risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">00:14:37</a>.

## Lessons Learned from the Crisis
The pandemic highlighted the need for preparedness and flexibility in facing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">00:22:48</a>. While some countries were well-prepared due to past experiences or adherence to recommendations, many, like Slovenia, were not, leading to struggles in initial responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">00:24:15</a>. Early European-level responses were chaotic, characterized by new borders and total disarray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">00:25:28</a>. However, subsequent phases demonstrated successful coordination, leading to recovery and resilience funds and significant financial support for vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">00:25:57</a>.

A key lesson from the pandemic is that a flexible system, allowing governments to take swift measures, is crucial for an effective initial response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">00:27:40</a>. However, democratic systems, with their need for parliamentary approvals, can sometimes hinder timely responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">00:28:05</a>. Conversely, innovation for solutions like vaccines came from countries with free markets, freedom, and democracy, rather than less democratic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">00:44:30</a>.

The crisis underscored the importance of digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">00:28:48</a>. Access to integrated online data, for instance across the EU or OECD countries, could have significantly improved the speed and targeting of responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">00:29:06</a>.

## Key Pillars for Future Governance: Innovation and Inclusion
To optimize recovery and prepare for future challenges, focus needs to be on immediate and medium-to-longer term priorities, including climate change, digital transformation, and strengthening international cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">00:14:56</a>. Policy support should remain flexible and targeted towards genuine need and future-focused investment in green and digital transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">00:16:01</a>.

### Innovation in Practice
[[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] is highlighted as a key word for the conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">00:07:10</a>. Petra Majdič, a former cross-country skiing champion, exemplified [[innovation_for_exploration_and_creativity_in_government | innovation]] by daring to be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">00:06:41</a>. Coming from a small country with fewer financial resources, she was forced to find innovative ways to achieve similar training conditions as nations like Norway or Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">00:05:31</a>. Her team's decision to use a unique, highly visible racing suit not only garnered attention but also attracted new sponsors, demonstrating that "dare to be different is not a handicap but it's an opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">00:06:41</a>.

Slovenia also contributed to pandemic response with its own innovations. A Slovenian company, BIA Separations, developed a technology for cleansing vaccines, which helps produce more secure shots at lower prices by removing impurities that cause side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">00:57:32</a>.

### Importance of People
The EIPA Director General, Marco Ongaro, emphasized that people are the key actors driving change, reorganization, and [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] within both citizens and public administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">00:34:42</a>. He highlighted the importance of adaptation and a flexible mindset, comparing children's ability to be "human chameleons" with adults' fear of failure, which hinders flexible and innovative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">00:07:11</a>.

> "If you want to tackle the problems for the future this is the kind of things people us the people in the administration the governments in general in the private sector et cetera need to do think differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">00:36:09</a>.

This adaptability, instilled by challenging and unexpected situations in her sports career, helped Petra Majdič's business career navigate the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">00:09:11</a>. She learned to never take the status quo for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">00:09:56</a>.

### Inclusion of Citizens and Professions
Inclusion is deemed a very important element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">00:36:43</a>. The pandemic revealed the crucial role of "invisible" professions like nurses, supermarket clerks, and truck drivers, who became everyday heroes by providing essential services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">00:37:00</a>. It is important that their voices are heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">00:37:35</a>. The concept of citizens' panels, taking place in different cities, is an experiment to bring people back to the center of decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">00:37:42</a>.

From a private sector perspective, empowering people within public administration to improve things is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">01:12:54</a>. This involves changing recruitment and evaluation methods, shifting focus from memorization to the ability to react to situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">01:14:06</a>. Opening up public sector positions to candidates from the private sector and recognizing their experience could also foster better understanding and collaboration between the two domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">01:15:04</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Global Crises
Future challenges may be more serious than the pandemic, with potential scenarios like a simultaneous pandemic and cyberattack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">00:29:56</a>. The need to prepare democracies to be more resilient towards such challenges is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">00:28:31</a>.

Climate change, though a slower-moving crisis than the pandemic, also requires urgent attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">00:59:02</a>. Lessons from the COVID-19 response, such as the need for rapid adaptation and effective leadership, apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">01:00:00</a>. However, climate change also demands long-term planning, strategic foresight, and investment in technologies like clean energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">01:01:20</a>.

A critical challenge is the need for global-level solutions for climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">01:03:50</a>. While the European Union is leading with ambitious goals like achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, it incurs economic costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">01:07:03</a>. Without the EU leading this struggle, there might not be enough global energy and power to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">01:08:38</a>. The current lack of a global organization to tackle climate change means focusing on investments in [[innovation_for_exploration_and_creativity_in_government | innovation]] to secure clean energy sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">01:09:42</a>.

## Moving Forward: Trust, Investment, and Cooperation
A surprising negative finding during the pandemic was the low trust in science in some parts of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">00:50:22</a>. This lack of trust can hinder decisions on major investments needed to tackle climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">00:51:50</a>. Investing in technologies that bring clean energy is seen as the biggest answer to the climate challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">00:52:03</a>.

Governments must foster public sectors that strategically embed [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] and foresight into policymaking, a commitment central to the OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">01:19:00</a>. More knowledge and experience sharing between countries within Europe is essential but currently not sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">01:16:00</a>. While European institutions and programs like Erasmus help distribute knowledge, bureaucratic obstacles remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">01:17:22</a>.

Better cooperation among European Union countries is a key element for facing future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">01:23:07</a>. Instead of countries working in silos, bringing people together to share knowledge and talk to each other can help them learn faster and avoid reinventing the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:35">01:23:35</a>. This collaborative approach, supported by organizations like EIPA and OECD, aims to build platforms for greater knowledge sharing and improved training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15">01:24:15</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to create a society in Europe that is [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]]-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">01:21:49</a>. The challenge is not the availability of knowledge or information, but how to use it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">01:21:56</a>. Citizens, from kindergarten onward, need to be taught how to use information, judge it, and prioritize effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">01:22:17</a>.

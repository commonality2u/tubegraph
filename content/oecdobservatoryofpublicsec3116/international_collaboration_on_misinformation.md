The complex nature of [[challenges_in_addressing_misinformation_in_different_contexts | misinformation]], which "knows no boundaries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, necessitates [[international_collaboration_during_crises | international collaboration]] to develop effective solutions benefiting global public welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This approach fosters inclusivity and diversity in framing pressing [[policy_implications_for_tackling_misinformation | policy issues]] and responding to complex challenges at local, regional, or global levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## The Need for International Collaboration

New digital technologies and information ecosystems have fundamentally reshaped how information is consumed and shared, leading to the spread of inaccurate information across all aspects of public life, including health, education, financial markets, and political affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The global challenge of misinformation heavily depends on individual behaviors, as its spread relies on people's choices in consuming and sharing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Ignoring the human factor poses a significant risk to the success of any solutions to tackle misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Effective responses to this global challenge should be designed and tested across borders, ideally through government collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This approach facilitates navigating the complex [[policy_implications_for_tackling_misinformation | policy landscape]] by incorporating diverse perspectives from multiple countries working towards a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Despite coordination [[challenges_in_addressing_misinformation_in_different_contexts | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, cross-border experimentation and coordination are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## The OECD-Canada-France Partnership

The OECD initiated a "first of its kind partnership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> between the Canadian and French governments to apply [[behavioral_science_applications_in_combating_misinformation | Behavioral Science]] to miss and disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> and develop solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The collaboration involved the OECD, Duke City's Impact Innovation Unit in the Canadian Privy Council Office, and the French Behavioral Insights Unit in the Ministry of Public Transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Origins and Goals
The collaboration was formed during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Behavioral Science teams worldwide pivoted to support government responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. In Canada, the team set up a large-scale longitudinal tracking study called Cosmo to understand how Canadians experienced the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. Data from Cosmo revealed the impact of believing false claims about COVID on downstream behaviors crucial to pandemic response, such as vaccination decisions or staying home when sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Recognizing that misinformation was not unique to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>, the Canadian team sought to partner with other governments and academic experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a> through the OECD's Behavioral Insights expert network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

The collaboration had three main objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>:
1.  **Understand complexities:** To better understand why people share misinformation on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
2.  **Evaluate interventions:** To assess the impact of [[interventions_and_strategies_to_reduce_misinformation | behavioral interventions]] on choices to share fake news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
3.  **Co-develop best practices:** To co-develop best practices for informing [[policy_implications_for_tackling_misinformation | policy responses]] to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Methodology
The study was an effectively randomized controlled trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a> led by the Canadian team as part of their Cosmo longitudinal survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. It involved nearly 2,000 Canadians, matched to national demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

The core hypothesis was that people share misinformation partly due to inattention to accuracy while engaging with news online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Two scalable [[interventions_and_strategies_to_reduce_misinformation | interventions]] were tested to boost attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>:
1.  **Accuracy Evaluation:** Respondents rated the accuracy of a random news headline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
2.  **Digital Media Literacy Tips:** Respondents saw a brief list of media literacy tips (e.g., "investigate the source," "look at other reports") before seeing news headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:25]</a>.

The study measured belief in true vs. false news and the likelihood of sharing news on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:49]</a>.

### Key Findings
*   People were more likely to rate true news as accurate and had higher intentions to share true headlines than false ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   However, the difference in sharing intentions for true vs. false headlines was four times smaller than the difference in accuracy judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:40]</a>. This suggests a disconnect, meaning some individuals may share fake news even when they don't believe it to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   Both [[interventions_and_strategies_to_reduce_misinformation | interventions]] were effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, but the digital media literacy tips had the greatest impact, reducing intentions to share fake news by 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   [[challenges_in_misinformation_sharing_and_belief | Individual differences]] in trust and information consumption patterns shaped beliefs and sharing of misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:28]</a>. Three clusters were identified:
    *   **Non-trusting:** Low trust in all sources, low openness to evidence, high conspiratorial thinking, high psychological reactants (approx. 20% of sample) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:14:17]</a>.
    *   **High trusting:** High trust in all information sources (especially social media), low openness to evidence, medium-high conspiratorial thinking, high psychological reactants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:41]</a>.
    *   **Institution trusting:** High trust in institutional sources, low trust in social media, high openness to evidence, low conspiratorial thinking, low psychological reactants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   The non-trusting and social media trusting clusters exhibited significantly greater belief and sharing of fake news compared to the institution trusting cluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:45]</a>.
*   The [[interventions_and_strategies_to_reduce_misinformation | interventions]] were found to be similarly effective across all three clusters, suggesting they are "globally useful" on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:24]</a>.

### Benefits and Experiences of the Collaboration
This [[international_collaboration_during_crises | international collaboration]] provided a "Brain Trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:49]</a>, allowing teams to regularly discuss data, literature reviews, and academic conversations to identify gaps in evidence and practical implications for governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:24:13]</a>. It enabled rapid launch of the pilot study due to existing infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:28]</a>. Benefits included:
*   **Diverse perspectives:** Tapping into diverse perspectives from scientists and practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Global network:** Connecting with a global network of academic experts, which was instrumental in sense-checking assumptions and providing technical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:25:07]</a>.
*   **Knowledge transfer:** Facilitating a significant transfer of knowledge across teams and countries, addressing issues of silos in [[policy_implications_for_tackling_misinformation | policy work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:38]</a>.
*   **Inspiration:** Inspiring teams to explore new ways of working and publishing results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **Ease of collaboration:** Despite cross-country and institutional differences, the OECD (specifically Kiara) made the experience "extremely easy and straightforward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:35]</a>.

## Policy Implications for Cross-Border Work
The collaboration yielded three key [[policy_implications_for_tackling_misinformation | policy messages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:43]</a>:
1.  **Don't ignore the human factor:** A comprehensive [[policy_implications_for_tackling_misinformation | policy response]] to dis- and misinformation must include an expanded understanding of human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:17:01]</a>. [[behavioral_science_and_misinformation | Behavioral Science]] is crucial as a policy tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:26]</a>.
2.  **Empower people:** The interventions focused on empowering users and changing their behaviors, rather than regulating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:21]</a>. These "effective and scalable solutions" complement holistic policy strategies and can help offset the threat of fake news without direct content regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:41]</a>.
3.  **Find what works across borders:** Governments should conduct rigorous policy experiments in collaboration with other countries to generate sustainable responses to the spread of misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:56]</a>. This international approach allows for broadening the tools available to policymakers, including less systemic, nudge-type interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:15]</a>.

## Future Directions
This collaboration is considered just the beginning of further work to determine which mitigation strategies work for whom and in what context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:18:10]</a>. There is a desire to replicate the study in other contexts, such as France, to validate findings and expand generalizability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:48]</a>. Future research is advocated to understand how [[interventions_and_strategies_to_reduce_misinformation | interventions]] might operate differently for various subtypes of misinformation (e.g., scientific, political, cultural) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:30]</a>.

Misinformation is also seen as a symptom of a larger problem: the erosion of trust in Western democracies and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:56]</a>. Addressing this core issue requires collective effort across governments, civil society, and other actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:49:02]</a>. The OECD's broader "Building Trust and Reinforcing Democracy" initiative aims to address key governance [[challenges_in_addressing_misinformation_in_different_contexts | challenges]] to democracy, with miss and disinformation being a critical component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:28]</a>. This initiative emphasizes a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach, looking at media literacy, regulatory transparency, and the role of [[the_role_of_social_media_platforms_in_spreading_misinformation | social media platforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:54:00]</a>, all contributing to building societal resilience to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:11]</a>.

Cancer has emerged as the primary cause of death in Western Europe, a challenge projected to escalate with aging societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Addressing this complex issue, which involves numerous parties, necessitates a structured collaborative approach among diverse [[stakeholders in healthcare innovation | stakeholders]] to achieve clear goals within a reasonable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Why a Mission-Oriented Approach for Cancer?

A [[mission oriented innovation | mission-oriented approach]] offers crucial directionality in tackling cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Without it, individual organizations with limited scope and mandates might move in different directions, leading to sub-optimal solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. For instance, precision cancer therapies might be too expensive due to a lack of sustainable reimbursement models, or diagnostic tools might be less accurate if data sharing across borders is restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The [[mission oriented innovation | mission approach]] facilitates joining forces, setting a common direction, and fostering shared understanding and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. It provides a framework for integrating systemic aspects of innovation, including technology, infrastructure, behavior, and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. No single actor can solve these challenges alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

The [[mission oriented innovation | mission approach]] is already implicit in many health areas, such as antimicrobial resistance, but making it explicit is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Cancer is particularly suited for this approach due to existing technological maturity, potential for new scientific advancements, and sufficient governance structures for health innovation, social systems, and regulatory frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Key Considerations for Missions in Cancer:

*   **Overcoming Fragmentation:** The European Commission aims to address fragmentation in research, healthcare, and education through this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Improving Outcomes:** The goal is to improve outcomes for at-risk individuals and patients, focusing research on their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Continuum of Care:** The mission must cover the complete continuum from prevention to therapy, including all components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure:** A robust infrastructure background, including comprehensive cancer centers and networks, is essential to reach all patients and address inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Prevention and Early Detection:** Prevention, which currently receives only about 7% of typical cancer research budgets, has an enormous potential to reduce the cancer problem by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Early detection is also crucial for better treatment outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Biological Questions:** Deeper analysis of biological questions, including heterogeneity within cancer types and genomic instability, is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Clinical Trials:** Structuring clinical trials for the next generation, which are more complex, and bridging the gap between innovation and implementation into the healthcare system are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Patient Involvement:** Patients must be involved in clinical trials and the development of comprehensive cancer centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. However, there are still gaps in health-related quality of life, outcomes research, and health economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Opportunities in Personalized Medicine for Cancer Patients

The biggest opportunities for [[building personalized medicine approaches in healthcare | personalized medicine]] lie in areas where multi-sectoral knowledge, experience, and decision power converge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Key opportunities include:
*   **Joint Mission and Co-ownership:** Aligning thoughts and ambitions around a mission makes collaboration easier, requiring co-ownership of actions and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Collaborators must take responsibility in their areas of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Lung Cancer Prevention and Early Detection:** A significant opportunity exists in lung cancer by focusing on greater prevention and earlier detection among risk groups and never-smokers to save lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This requires collaboration beyond medical specialists and industry, involving behavioral sociologists and communication experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Collaboration and Implementation

### Engaging Diverse Stakeholders

*   **Patient and Relative Involvement:** Actively involving patients and their relatives at all stages is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Communication:** Consistent communication is key to getting things done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

A "penta helix" model, involving academia, healthcare, patients, authorities, and industry, is crucial for [[building personalized medicine approaches in healthcare | personalized medicine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. While these partners are committed, a change in how they work together is needed as they are not always accustomed to inter-organizational collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. National [[building personalized medicine approaches in healthcare | precision medicine]] initiatives are growing in Europe, with over 34 national/regional initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Closer [[crossdisciplinary_collaboration_for_mission_success | collaboration across borders]] is essential, especially for rare diseases or cancers, to ensure patient access to detection technologies and therapies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

### Public-Private Partnerships

Large public-private partnerships, like the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) and the upcoming Innovative Health Initiative, demonstrate successful collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. The IMI, a 10 billion euro endeavor, with half the budget from the European Commission and half from industry in-kind contributions (people, not just money), fosters collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Within cancer, 12 major projects, totaling almost 200 million euros, aim to catalyze state-of-the-art oncology research and development, involving over 200 partners from 19 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

To succeed, these partnerships require:
*   **Alignment on Objectives:** Full agreement and buy-in on clear objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Legal and IP Framework:** A clear legal and intellectual property framework is essential to prevent conflicts between academic and industry goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Clear Work Plan:** A well-defined work plan ensures every participant understands their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
*   **Professional Alliance Management:** This crucial, often overlooked aspect ensures large projects are managed effectively, as researchers alone cannot handle them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

### Unconventional Partnerships

Sometimes, unusual partners outside the traditional healthcare field can be crucial. For example, identifying a gap in patient access due to lack of transport led to considering partnerships with ministries of economy or transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. Lessons from initiatives like the European initiative on active and healthy aging show the value of collaborating with diverse sectors like food and transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. For prevention, cooperation with education and schools is needed to raise awareness and improve health literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

### Building Trust

Building trust is critical, and it doesn't happen overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. It requires hard work, joint discussion, and shared development of the vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>. Concrete examples include industry partners learning to collaborate among themselves and legal teams working together to establish IP frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. Challenges like regulatory agencies being reluctant to partner with companies they regulate can be overcome by providing a neutral arena with neutral leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. Strong leadership, consistent communication, and transparency are vital pillars for successful collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.

## Highest Priorities on the To-Do List

### Innovation Agencies' Perspective
Innovation agencies prioritize creating better conditions for building partnerships across sectors, disciplines, and countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. They aim to support [[crossdisciplinary_collaboration_for_mission_success | collaborative mission-driven initiatives]] where actors can establish shared commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.

Key areas include:
*   **Agile Approach to Funding:** Public funders, like Vinnova, are adopting more agile approaches, allowing adaptability within consortia over time, even if it feels "scary" to fund initiatives without clear initial specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Funding:** Innovation funding is often project-based and short-term. Funders need to collaborate more closely to ensure a long-term perspective on funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.
*   **Health Economics and Reimbursement:** More work on health economics is needed to understand the societal benefits of [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] and to develop holistic, sustainable reimbursement models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.
*   **Case-Based Work and Demonstrators:** The ability to work case-based and build demonstrators, rather than attempting to change the entire system at once, is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. The Vision Zero Cancer initiative, starting with lung cancer, exemplifies this by addressing systemic innovation in a scalable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

### Digital Transformation and Data
[[Digital transformation in health care | Digital transformation]] is critical, especially concerning data. Priorities include:
*   **Data Management:** Ensuring data quality, standards, access, protection, and cybersecurity, viewing these as support tools rather than limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.
*   **Patient Input:** Utilizing patient-reported experiences, outcomes, and incidents through online monitoring platforms for remote monitoring and information exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
*   **Integrated Information Fields:** Including different [[stakeholders in healthcare innovation | stakeholders]] like social care, hospitals, and primary care within the same information field is a challenge that needs to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
*   **Integrating Genetics into Routine Healthcare:** The challenge of integrating genetic information into routine healthcare, alongside other patient data, requires awareness raising and patient engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.
*   **Prioritization:** Before launching activities that create knowledge of risks (e.g., genetic testing), there must be agreement on how to handle individuals with those risks, including service offerings and reimbursement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.

### Patient Advocacy Perspective
Involving patients is crucial, but the "how" is often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. It's difficult to reach a representative group and requires significant resources, not just good intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. Patients, as citizens, must be truly involved to ensure services deliver what matters to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. Bottom-up solutions are critical, as they reveal unexpected challenges like transport issues preventing medical intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>.

### Healthcare System Administration
Respecting and understanding administrative systems and leadership within healthcare is also essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. Activities are often tied to administrative routines and annual budget cycles, which need to be addressed jointly by all sectors, including industry and academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.

### Sustainable Infrastructure
[[Cancer collaborative initiatives | Collaboration between research groups]] alone is insufficient for sustainable change; a strong infrastructure background is needed, especially as [[building personalized medicine approaches in healthcare | personalized medicine]] becomes more prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. This requires collaboration between integrated centers that combine research, education, and healthcare, such as comprehensive cancer centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

### Transparency
Transparency within the mission is key, ensuring all parties know what others are doing to avoid repetition and effectively use resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. Lessons learned from the [[missionoriented_innovation_in_cancer_prevention_and_care | cancer mission]] and [[crossdisciplinary_collaboration_for_mission_success | cooperation with primary care]] should be shared broadly across healthcare, not just within the specific mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>.

## Outlook

Europe has demonstrated its capability to develop and scale new therapies rapidly, as seen with the COVID-19 vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. This achievement serves as a "demonstrator" for what can be accomplished in [[cancer collaborative initiatives | cancer initiatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>. The focus on [[missionoriented_innovation_in_cancer_prevention_and_care | cancer]] now, coupled with learnings from the pandemic, presents a unique opportunity to redefine cancer care and establish a "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>. The fact that the Swedish Cancer Vision is housed at Vinnova, an innovation agency rather than a research agency, offers a broader perspective beneficial for this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>. With [[stakeholders in healthcare innovation | stakeholders]] aligned and a clear vision like "Vision Zero Cancer," the stage is set to advance [[building personalized medicine approaches in healthcare | personalized medicine]] in cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. The healthy competition among countries like Sweden and Estonia in [[digital transformation in health care | digital health]] further indicates positive momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. This is a joint learning process, supported by frameworks that foster leadership and trust-building mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.

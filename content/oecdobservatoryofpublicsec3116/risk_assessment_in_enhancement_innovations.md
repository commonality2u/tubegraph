[[enhancement_oriented_innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]], a common practice in government innovation activities, focuses on upgrading existing practices and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Examples include making taxation systems work better, faster, or quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, or using behavioral insights to encourage faster tax payments or more informed responses to inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Characteristics of [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | Enhancement Oriented Innovation]] and Risk

The risks associated with [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] are relatively low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These innovations do not typically call for the transformation of entire systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Instead, they are implemented within the existing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Calculability of Risks

A key aspect of [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] is the ability to calculate the risks connected to their implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This allows for either directing innovation to improve a specific system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, or exploiting existing ideas to enhance current operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Foresight and scenario planning are crucial for navigating the rapidly changing and unpredictable future of the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The world is constantly evolving, making it essential to understand where disruptions originate and where global trends are heading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Need for Foresight

The current global context, highlighted by events like the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrates that public administration can be agile and responsive, adapting quickly to new ways of working and communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. However, to sustain this agility and foster innovation, public sector organizations must be designed to be dynamic and resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. Governments traditionally prioritize stability and control, managing risk and ensuring quality services at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:32">[01:53:32]</a>. While these traits are necessary, especially in times of crisis, there is a continuous need to proactively push for [[anticipatory_innovation_and_strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | innovation]] and transformation to meet evolving societal expectations and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>.

## What is Foresight and Scenario Planning?

[[strategic_foresight_tools_and_methods | Foresight]] involves using future thinking, scenarios, and other methods to anticipate potential developments and systematically explore uncertain futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. It encourages organizations to be both humble and ambitious about the unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The future is not a single predetermined path; various forces are at play, leading to different possible scenarios, particularly concerning technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

Scenario planning, a specific foresight tool, is a methodical and disciplined process, often conducted every three to five years in governments like Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. This process helps convert individuals to thinking in terms of future possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.

## Benefits and Purpose

### Anticipating and Shaping the Future
[[Role of Foresight in Policymaking | Foresight]] helps governments understand where disruptions come from and where the world is headed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It allows the public sector to transition from a "wait and see" reactive stance to actively participating in and steering societal transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:33">[01:53:33]</a>. By imagining desired futures, stakeholders can be mobilized to implement radically different, more future-fit public sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Enhancing Policy and Service Delivery
[[Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | Strategic foresight]] can improve public services, making them customer-focused, efficient, innovative, personalized, and technology-enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. This requires innovating and transforming current practices, embracing agile structures, and formalizing practices like remote working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. It also promotes evidence-based policymaking through the use of data and analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.

### Fostering Collaboration and Co-creation
Foresight encourages [[collaborative_approaches_in_foresight | collaboration]] within and outside government ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This includes cooperation and exchange of good practices with other governments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, as well as co-creating services directly with citizens through active citizenship platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The combination of design methods and foresight enables immersion and exploration of future stories, allowing decision-makers and citizens to envision future scenarios and make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Cultivating New Thinking and Capabilities
[[Strategic foresight for future global challenges | Strategic foresight]] encourages "expansive thinking," enhancing engagement with critical global challenges and expanding resources to think differently about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. This includes considering vastly different time horizons (e.g., designing a society for the next 9,000 years, as exemplified by a Norwegian village project) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>.

## Challenges

### Mindset and Structural Incompatibility
A key challenge is that current mindsets and bureaucratic structures within the public sector can be incompatible with desired future states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. For example, while the rhetoric might support agile working or smart cities, deep-seated practices (e.g., traditional performance appraisals, procurement processes) can impede radical change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.

### Entrenched Futures and Paradigms
Certain "futures" are already being written or assumed without conscious realization, such as the established power of digital giants and the way they shape interactions, deepen divides, and even influence forms of conflict (e.g., mass disinformation campaigns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. Other deeply entrenched narratives include:
*   **Capitalism**: The common perception of markets as purely separate from government, rather than co-created by various actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.
*   **Growth Narrative**: The relentless focus on GDP growth as the primary measure of progress, despite its failure to address climate change or inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.
*   **Linearity and Progress**: A deep-seated belief that the future will always be a linear progression and inherently better than the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. This belief has eroded, with many generations now believing the future will be worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>.

## Implementing Foresight

### Scouting and Naming Emerging Issues
A core function of foresight involves scouting for early signals of change and emerging issues. Giving these signals a name helps to formalize their existence, allowing leaders and policymakers to discuss them, trigger important conversations, and generate new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. This requires discipline and protecting time and space for these processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

### Challenging the Present
Foresight must challenge existing mindsets and structures that are incompatible with desired futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. This can be done by pointing out inconsistencies or, more effectively, by immersing people in future experiences through storytelling and scenarios to build empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

### Growing Capability and Playing the Long Game
To embed foresight, it's crucial to "grow" the capability for future thinking across the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. This involves:
*   **Formal Training and Experiential Learning**: Combining formal training in foresight tools with practical application through "doing as training" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   **Communities of Practice**: Building communities around foresight and future thinking, contextualized to the local policy environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.
*   **Developing People**: Having a "revolving door" policy where officers are trained in future thinking and then return to their respective agencies, acting as "multipliers" and advocates for foresight at leadership levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

## Key Capabilities for the Future

The public sector needs to develop specific capabilities to be dynamic and resilient by design:

1.  **Ability to Frame and Reframe Problems**: Moving away from policy silos to reframe problems in ways that citizens understand and that motivate civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. This includes shifting from GDP as a measure to well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.
2.  **Openness**: Cultivating open public organizations with flatter, team-based structures and leveraging digital infrastructure that supports openness by design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. This includes communities of practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.
3.  **Ethics of Innovation**: With increased openness and innovation, public servants need a strong ethical capability to navigate complex, uncertain spaces, understand biases, and incorporate diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>.
4.  **Diversity of Analytical Viewpoints**: Moving beyond backward-looking statistical or economic analysis to integrate diverse approaches like ethnographic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>. This diversity is crucial for understanding power dynamics and analyzing events effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

By embracing these approaches and capabilities, the public sector can actively shape a better future, fostering inclusive, circular, and connected societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>.

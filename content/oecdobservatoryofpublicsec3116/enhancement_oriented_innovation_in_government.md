[[enhancement_oriented_innovation | Enhancement oriented innovation]] is one of the most common practices undertaken by [[innovation_in_government | governments]] when engaging in [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This approach focuses on upgrading and improving existing systems and practices within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Characteristics and Examples
[[enhancement_oriented_innovation | Enhancement oriented innovation]] involves:
*   **Upgrading Existing Systems** Enhancing current practices and systems that are already in place within the [[innovation_in_government | government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Process Improvement** Making existing processes, such as taxation systems, work better, faster, and more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Insights Application** Utilizing behavioral insights, for instance, to encourage citizens to pay taxes faster or respond to queries in a more informed manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Risk Profile
One of the key features of [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement oriented innovation]] is its relatively low risk profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These [[innovation_in_government | innovations]] typically do not require the fundamental transformation of entire systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Instead, they are implemented within the current structures of [[innovation_in_government | government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This allows for the calculation and management of risks associated with their implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Purpose
The primary goals of [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement oriented innovation]] are to:
*   Improve specific systems, making them more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   Leverage existing ideas to enhance current processes and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

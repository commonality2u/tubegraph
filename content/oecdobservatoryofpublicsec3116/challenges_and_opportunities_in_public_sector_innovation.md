The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) is spearheading a public consultation process for a draft declaration on [[innovation_in_public_sector | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This declaration aims to foster [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation action]] by codifying language and fostering a common understanding across governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. The initiative draws on the experiences of countries like Canada and France, which have already implemented their own declarations or manifestos to drive public service transformation.

## Canada's Declaration on Public Sector Innovation

Canada's Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] has been in place for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Its genesis began in 2015 when the heads of Canada's public services (federal, provincial, and territorial) started discussions on public service renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The goal was to ensure the public service kept pace with external changes and remained relevant to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Common [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | challenges]] identified across government levels included:
*   Effective use of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>
*   Impactful use of digital technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
*   Engaging citizens for co-creation and co-design of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>

After annual gatherings dedicated to [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]], a non-binding declaration was drafted and signed in November 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This was a historic moment, as it was the first time all heads of public services in Canada signed onto a document together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

The declaration serves as a "signpost" to:
*   Signal that public service leaders care about new approaches, risk-taking, and testing ideas, even if they don't always work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Empower agencies and decision-makers to pursue [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] for better policy and program delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   Facilitate more meaningful engagement and co-creation of new ideas with provincial and territorial colleagues, embodying a "safer in numbers" approach to de-risk [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## France's Manifesto for Public Sector Innovation

France released its manifesto for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The motivation stemmed from a growing interest in [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] within the French administration, notably the creation of new public labs in many regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. There was an expectation to define [[innovation_in_public_sector | public sector innovation]] within the French context and provide guidelines for new public servants who were unfamiliar with concepts like labs, design thinking, or experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

The manifesto aimed to:
*   Prevent [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] from being merely a "fashion" and establish it as a serious approach to public policymaking that yields tangible results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   Provide a common reference text and official national guidelines to promote and define [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   Offer legitimacy and a basis for public sector innovators, helping them convince colleagues that their work was serious and impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   Serve as a main tool for developing the community of public innovators, fostering a shared vision and mindset to change the culture of French public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

## Challenges and Reactions to Declarations

Both Canada and France experienced similar [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | challenges]] and reactions to their respective documents:
*   **Initial Skepticism/Difficulty in Endorsement**: In France, there were initial difficulties getting the manifesto endorsed by leadership, with concerns that it might be "too early" or the administration "not mature enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Hostility or Lack of Seriousness**: A persistent [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | challenge]] is the hostility or lack of serious consideration from many in top administration who don't understand [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] or resist different ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   **Limited Transformative Impact**: While helpful, the documents alone are not sufficient to fully transform governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. They serve as a step forward, helping to drive political support and grow communities, but a full impact is still in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
*   **Perception of Innovation**: The concept of [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] and experimentation within government is still in its infancy or adolescent phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. The declaration acts as a guidepost, acknowledging [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] in a positive or neutral way, but deeper systemic shifts are still needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

## The OECD's Perspective on an International Declaration

The OECD's draft declaration aims to unify efforts and signify the importance of [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] as an embedded part of how governments operate, not just an addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. Key ideas underpinning the declaration include:
*   **Context-dependent Nature of Innovation**: [[innovation_in_public_sector | Innovation]] is inherently contextual, pushing activities towards segmented patterns, hence the need for a unifying declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
*   **Addressing Modern Challenges**: [[innovation_in_public_sector | Innovation]] is crucial for governments to address modern [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | challenges]], though it's not always the most appropriate choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
*   **Embedding Innovation Systemically**: While [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] has always occurred, its current rate doesn't match the need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. The declaration seeks to embed [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] as a more systemic activity across government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
*   **Sophisticated Conversation about Innovation**: The term "innovation" is broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. The declaration aims to build a more accessible language by unpacking its multifaceted nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

The OECD introduces the concept of "innovation facets," which are incorporated into the declaration:
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation**: Improving existing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented innovation**: Achieving ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation**: Responding to a changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation**: Engaging with weak signals early to shape change rather than just react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

Effective governments must maintain a portfolio across these facets, hedging bets to be ready for unpredictable [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. The declaration aims to tell a richer story about why [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] matters, why governments support it, and how all public servants can play a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. It emphasizes the need to:
*   Embrace and enhance existing [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   Equip all public servants for their role in [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
*   Foster new partnerships and diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
*   Recognize [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] as a continually evolving practice requiring shared learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

## Public Consultation and Next Steps

The OECD's public consultation process for the draft declaration opened in November and concludes on February 22nd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. Feedback is welcomed from individuals, organizations, groups, or countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. Useful contributions include:
*   Identifying what makes sense or doesn't, and suggesting alternative wording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.
*   Suggesting language changes to avoid jargon (e.g., "weak signals") or address cultural differences in terminology (e.g., "civil servant" vs. "public servant") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
*   Highlighting the usefulness or impossibility of proposed actions in specific contexts, and their potential implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. For example, clarification that "failure" in [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] refers to experimentation as a discrete activity for auditing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

The declaration is intended to be an official, non-legally binding OECD instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. Its purpose is to signal the importance of [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] in government, inspire [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] strategies, and encourage deeper reflection on existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

### Citizen Participation and Leadership
[[Citizen participation]] is considered a crucial part of an effective [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] process, as [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] relies on understanding diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. The OECD also actively researches the leadership mindsets and skills required to develop [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] capabilities and the specific skills needed at different stages of the [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. Recognizing that no single person possesses all necessary skills, an ecosystem of diverse players is required for successful [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.

The OECD encourages engagement from all levels of government, including local governments, as [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] must be considered from an ecosystem perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. Local bodies can affirm commitment to the declaration as an important signal to their stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

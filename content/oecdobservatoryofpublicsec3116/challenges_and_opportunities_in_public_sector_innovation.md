This article provides an overview of two recent OECD reports focusing on [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] in Brazil, drawing from a webinar featuring Alex Roberts and Daniel Gerson from the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), and Guilhermer from ENAP (Brazil's National School for Public Administration). The discussion highlights the context, challenges, and opportunities for fostering a more deliberate and systemic approach to innovation within the Brazilian public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Context of the Reports
The reports stem from a Memorandum of Understanding between ENAP and the OECD signed in 2015, specifically centered on [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>. Following a successful review of digital government in 2016, two new reviews were initiated: one focusing on innovation skills and leadership, and another on the innovation system within the Brazilian public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. These reports, consolidated through several missions and consultations, were launched at the fifth edition of Brazil's [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:02">[04:59:02]</a>. An external vision was crucial in ensuring continuity for these agendas across governmental transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:18">[06:06:18]</a>.

## Why Public Sector Innovation is Needed
[[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] is essential for Brazil to achieve its ambitions and address real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. It must be at the core of government, not merely a sporadic or reactive activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Current challenges are so complex that routine, ongoing innovation is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Specific drivers for innovation in Brazil include:
*   Addressing inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>
*   Managing the government's financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>
*   Combating corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>
*   Dealing with changing demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>

While innovation isn't a "magic bullet," it is a necessary component for tackling these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Historical Journey of Innovation in Brazil
Over the last three decades, Brazil has focused on areas conducive to innovation:
*   **De-bureaucratization**: Emphasis on making the public service more efficient and streamlining processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **New Public Management (1990s)**: Reform ideas aimed at streamlining processes and enhancing government effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Modernization**: A period following New Public Management focusing on government modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation**: Significant attention over the last decade on digital transformation and specific innovation needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

This history reveals recurring patterns in the Brazilian public service, such as a legalistic system, strong emphasis on controls and corruption, and a focus on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. While innovation has gained momentum, it has not yet been fully integrated into the public service narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Mandates or presidential decrees alone are insufficient; continuous embedding of innovation practices is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## [[Challenges and opportunities in government innovation | Challenges in Public Sector Innovation]]
Several inherent characteristics of the public sector, not unique to Brazil, contribute to a shortfall in innovation:
*   **Risk Aversion**: The public sector is fundamentally designed to avoid negative feedback and mistakes, unlike the private sector which can tolerate failures for potential profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Political processes tend to focus on what goes wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
*   **Complexity**: Innovation itself is challenging, requiring continuous learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   **Lack of Systemic Approach**: Much of the innovation observed in Brazil is driven by individual efforts or organizational perspectives, rather than a coordinated systemic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:36">[02:39:36]</a>. This reliance on individuals makes innovation vulnerable to staff turnover or burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:54">[01:50:54]</a>.
*   **Structural Bias**: The existing structure often pushes innovation towards incremental and uncontroversial changes, despite a need for more radical exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:01">[02:40:01]</a>.
*   **Implicit Stewardship**: Stewardship of the innovation system is often implicit rather than officially recognized or deliberately managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:01">[02:46:01]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The reform agenda is ongoing, and there is no simple "magic bullet" or quick fix for embedding innovation. It's a continuous journey of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58">[01:42:58]</a>.

## Achieving Deliberate and Systemic Innovation
A deliberate and systemic approach to [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] requires addressing three key questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:34">[01:36:34]</a>:
1.  Is innovation occurring to the extent needed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a>
2.  Is the innovation mix appropriate (e.g., the right types of innovation)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>
3.  Is there sufficient stewardship to ensure the innovation system delivers as hoped? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:24">[01:43:24]</a>

### Models for Understanding Innovation
To illustrate these concepts, OPSI employs two models:

#### The Determinants Model
This model examines the underlying factors that determine the extent of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. It views innovation through three lenses of activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>:
*   **Individual-driven innovation**: Often seen in Brazil, but unsustainable as it relies on luck or individual effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>.
*   **Organization-driven innovation**: Focuses on solving problems specific to a single organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.
*   **Systemic activity**: Integrates collective interests into the innovation process, which is the desired level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:32">[01:53:32]</a>.

Moving innovation up from individual to organizational and systemic levels is crucial for sustainability and addressing societal questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:16">[01:59:16]</a>.

#### The [[Facets of Public Sector Innovation | Innovation Facets Model]]
This model describes different types of innovation activities, helping to assess the mix of innovation occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:37">[02:07:37]</a>:
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation**: Building on existing approaches, doubling down on what's already present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented innovation**: Dealing with big, audacious goals, like putting a man on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation**: Driven by bottom-up changes on the ground, responding to shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:15">[02:17:15]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation**: Asking big questions about current practices and future relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:41">[02:20:41]</a>.

The mix of these facets determines how innovation is shaped. In Brazil's risk-conscious environment, innovation often leans towards enhancement-oriented changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>. The question then becomes whether this mix is a deliberate choice or an unintended outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:17">[02:30:17]</a>.

### System Stewardship
[[Public Sector Innovation | Innovation]] is inherently contextual and can pull a system in different directions, especially in a large and complex system like Brazil with thousands of local government situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:01">[02:31:01]</a>. This can create tension with the need for overall coherence and interoperability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>. Therefore, some form of collective consideration or "stewardship" of the whole system is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:05">[02:37:05]</a>.

## Role of Leadership and Skills in Innovation
A separate report delves into the leadership and skills required for innovation, especially among senior civil servants (DAS five and six positions, or FCPE equivalents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>.

### Why Focus on Senior Civil Servants?
*   **Productivity and Efficiency**: Brazil's civil service is expensive (13% of GDP vs. OECD average of 10%; almost 30% of public expenditure vs. OECD average of 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:04">[03:47:04]</a>. Effective leadership can ensure this investment is managed well, maximizing the talent of public servants to meet pressing needs like innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:16">[03:59:16]</a>.
*   **Public Trust and Integrity**: A highly qualified, professional senior civil service is linked to greater integrity and trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:15">[04:11:15]</a>.
*   **Innovation Support**: Leadership support is consistently identified as one of the most crucial enablers for innovation, and its absence is a major barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:52">[04:19:52]</a>.

### Core Skills for Public Sector Innovation
While there's no simple formula, OPSI identified six core skill areas for successful public sector organizations to engage in and produce innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:25">[04:42:25]</a>. Leaders need to ensure their workforce possesses and can activate these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:39">[04:54:39]</a>.

A survey of nearly 3,000 Brazilian civil servants revealed:
*   **Self-assessment**: Mid-level confidence in their own skills, with strong curiosity but less confidence in iteration or user-centricity (e.g., prototyping, behavioral insights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:16">[04:59:16]</a>.
*   **Management support**: Significantly lower perceptions of management's ability to support their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:44">[05:08:44]</a>.
*   **Organizational readiness**: Perceptions fell between self-assessment and management support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:39">[05:11:39]</a>.

### Leadership Model for Innovation
Based on workshops with Brazilian public sector innovators, a leadership model emerged, founded on public service values and ethics, comprising three main skill groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:43">[05:52:43]</a>:
1.  **Business skills**: Aligning resources with needs, using various management tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:47">[06:09:47]</a>.
2.  **Innovation skills**: Leaders need to understand how to support iterative processes, data, and create space for those using these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:09">[06:17:09]</a>.
3.  **Mindsets**: This includes empathy, empowering civil servants, continuous learning, courage, and digital thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:40">[06:21:40]</a>.

### Senior Civil Service System: Supply and Demand
Most OECD countries have a structured system for senior civil service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:49">[06:54:49]</a>. The report frames this in terms of supply and demand:

*   **Supply Side (Building Leaders)**:
    *   Clearly define required skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:17">[07:46:17]</a>.
    *   Provide opportunities to develop these skills, both for current and future leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:17">[07:51:17]</a>.
    *   Map the workforce to identify existing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:24">[07:58:24]</a>.
    *   Create a learning culture for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:36">[08:04:36]</a>.
*   **Demand Side (Calling for Leaders)**:
    *   Appoint leaders based on clear, transparent criteria, especially innovation-related ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:02">[08:40:02]</a>.
    *   Provide ongoing support through training, performance, and accountability mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:03">[08:52:03]</a>.

In Brazil, while there is significant effort on the supply side (e.g., various innovation training initiatives), the demand side faces greater [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_government_innovation | challenges]] due to the political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:06">[09:56:06]</a>. Appointment processes are often at the will of the president and ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:06">[10:04:06]</a>.

> [!TIP] A presidential decree has established minimum criteria for DAS and FCPE positions, a good starting point, but much more is needed to develop a genuine senior civil service system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:24">[10:18:24]</a>.

## Key Achievements and Areas of Opportunity
Brazil has made notable achievements in [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]]:
*   **Innovation Awards**: Provide rich insights, underscore the value of public service, and inspire others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:37">[02:15:37]</a>.
*   **InovaGov Network & Innovation Week**: Great mechanisms for socializing innovation, connecting people, and building momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>.
*   **Collaboration**: Strong collaboration between major actors, including joint sponsorship of the report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>.
*   **Innovation Labs**: Encouraging growth of labs in different agencies, testing new approaches and fostering sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:05">[02:33:05]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation Agenda**: Highlighted the value of change and serves as a model for broader system-level transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:13">[02:39:13]</a>.

The reports provide "useful prompts" and "starting points" for advancing the system to be more mature, systemic, and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:13">[02:49:13]</a>. Key areas of opportunity are categorized by audience:

*   **For the Whole System**:
    *   Establish an explicit agenda for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]], clarifying what is wanted and how it will be supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:08">[03:04:08]</a>.
    *   Give more attention to structural drivers to offset inherent inertia and bias against innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:08">[03:10:08]</a>.
    *   Assign explicit responsibility for stewardship of the [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:03">[03:18:03]</a>.
*   **For Central Actors**:
    *   Major agencies (e.g., ENAP, Ministry of Economy, TCU) should have explicit roles in system functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:21">[03:25:21]</a>.
    *   Ministry of Economy should clarify links between [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:01">[03:32:01]</a>.
    *   Control bodies (e.g., TCU) should identify how audit and risk management can support innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:09">[03:38:09]</a>.
    *   ENAP, on behalf of the InovaGov Network, could partner to develop an annual high-level commentary on the performance of the [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:04">[03:46:04]</a>.
*   **For Individual Agencies**:
    *   Identify where innovation is needed in their operations and publicize those priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:02">[03:54:02]</a>.

## Role of External Actors
### Public Universities
Public universities play a crucial role in the [[public_sector_innovation | innovation system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.
*   **Insight and Rigor**: They can provide insight into identifying problems, generate new ideas (technology, policies, practices), and add rigor to implementation assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:13">[11:11:13]</a>.
*   **Talent Pipeline**: Universities train the next generation of civil servants and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. Stronger linkages between government and universities are needed to attract talent, teach relevant skills, and present the public sector as a valuable career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Creation**: Universities contribute to knowledge creation and can foster stronger connections between government, universities, and the private sector to develop innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:19">[11:51:19]</a>.
*   **Policy Piloting**: Universities can be brought in to pilot public policies, enabling faster testing and appraisal of new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:24">[17:18:24]</a>.

### Open Innovation
Open innovation can be a valuable tool, recognizing that solutions may come from outside government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. It is particularly effective when broad aims are known and external solutions can be integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:08">[18:40:08]</a>. However, its value may be less in exploratory or adaptive innovation spaces where questions are less clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>.

Brazil is experimenting with open innovation through initiatives like a public challenge platform where organizations can suggest challenges and offer awards for solutions and prototypes, even providing additional funding for better implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
The reports provide a clear vision of the context, [[Challenges and opportunities of public sector innovation in a crisis | challenges]], and path forward for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Key challenges ahead include translating and disseminating the reports, keeping the conversation going, and creating networks to engage more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to promote the skills needed for a more effective Brazilian civil service system and its civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. The journey of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is continuous, requiring ongoing learning, experimentation, and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

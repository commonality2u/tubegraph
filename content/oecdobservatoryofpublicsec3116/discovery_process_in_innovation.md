The [[discovery process in innovation]] is central to [[adaptive innovation | adaptive innovation]], focusing on uncovering new possibilities rather than achieving predefined goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It emphasizes [[exploration and adaptive innovation | exploring new ideas]] and determining what is feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Purpose and Characteristics
This process is crucial for the emergence of genuinely new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While conventional thinking often operates within existing systems and paradigms, the [[discovery process in innovation]], through [[adaptive innovation | adoption]], actively seeks out novel ideas on the ground that could prove beneficial to current services or even challenge established systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Enabling Discovery

For effective discovery, individuals need the autonomy and space, particularly from a [[bottomup innovation | bottom-up perspective]], to explore new concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Those working most closely with citizens can draw upon signals from their daily lives to innovate, test, and experiment based on direct feedback from the system itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Outcomes

The [[discovery process in innovation]] can lead to both transformative changes and enhancement-oriented innovations, with both types being highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Example: Canada's Regulatory Apps
In Canada, various [[adaptive innovation | adaptive innovations]] have emerged where individuals developed applications "by the side of their desk" to simplify regulatory systems for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This initiative focused on making complex regulations understandable and usable for clients, shifting the [[problem_framing_in_innovation | problem]] from excessive regulation to its comprehensibility and applicability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This outcome was a direct result of [[adaptive innovation | adaptation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

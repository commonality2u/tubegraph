The "Government beyond recovery: anticipation to bold missions" conference, co-organized by the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), highlighted the critical need for new, adaptive missions in the wake of [[challenges_and_responses_during_the_covid19_pandemic | the COVID-19 crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06"></a>. The pandemic provides an opportunity to define new missions to prevent future global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45"></a>.

## The Imperative for Future-Ready Missions

The central challenge is to establish missions as a long-term endeavor, capable of envisioning alternative futures and committing to new challenges in agile and iterative ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07"></a>. This approach aims to prevent "lock-in" within current mission frameworks, given the uncertain future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14"></a>.

A poll conducted during the conference revealed that only about 17% of organizations or countries surveyed felt their missions were "future-ready" or had mechanisms built for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18"></a>. In contrast, 41% stated their missions were definitely not future-ready, and a significant 43% were unsure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55"></a>.

Areas identified as most uncertain and influenced by continuous change include:
*   Climate challenges (47% of responses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22"></a>.
*   Societal challenges (nearly 40% of responses), influenced by new technologies and evolving social contexts, as demonstrated by the accelerated adoption of technology and changes in urbanization patterns during [[impacts_and_vulnerabilities_revealed_by_covid19 | COVID-19]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05"></a>.
*   Economic challenges (25%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20"></a>.
*   Health challenges (15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23"></a>.

## Current Approaches and Examples

Organizations like the OPSI are focusing on both anticipatory and mission-oriented approaches, including the launch of a Missions Action Lab to correctly implement missions iteratively and agilely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02"></a>.

### European Commission
The European Commission's DG Research & Innovation launched five missions in September, with significant funding from the Horizon Europe program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29"></a>. These missions are integrated across the EU policy agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41"></a>:
1.  **Conquering Cancer**: Targeting over 3 million lives saved and improved living by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47"></a>.
2.  **Climate Resilient Europe**: Preparing Europe for climate disruptions and accelerating transition to a healthy, prosperous future by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53"></a>.
3.  **Mission Starfish (Oceans and Waters)**: Restoring oceans and waters, aiming to clean marine and fresh waters, and restore degraded ecosystems by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06"></a>.
4.  **100 Climate Neutral Cities by 2030**: Supporting and showcasing systemic transformation towards climate neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18"></a>.
5.  **Caring for Soil (Life)**: Ensuring at least 75% of EU soils are healthy for food, people, nature, and climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29"></a>.

The development of these missions benefited from foresight, ground-up evidence gathering, expertise from mission boards, and novel approaches to citizen engagement and listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17"></a>.

### Denmark
Denmark is focusing on missions and mission-driven innovation, particularly in the green transition, aiming to be a frontrunner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27"></a>. The Danish government's green research strategy (September 2020) highlights four specific green research and innovation missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37"></a>:
1.  Capture and storage or use of CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47"></a>.
2.  Green fuels for transport and industry (Power-to-X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50"></a>.
3.  Climate and environment-friendly agriculture and food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55"></a>.
4.  Circular economy with a focus on plastics and textiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03"></a>.

These missions aim to contribute to a 70% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050, while also increasing biodiversity and the competitiveness of Danish industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36"></a>. Success relies on a systemic development of technologies and solutions, considering the full value chain including financial and regulatory roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09"></a>. Denmark has embraced an urgent, iterative approach, developing its mission program within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56"></a>.

### Norway
Norway is utilizing mission orientation and strategic foresight to develop "seamless services for life events" within its public sector digital strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28"></a>. This addresses "wicked problems" that require systemic changes across sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24"></a>. The seven prioritized life events include:
*   New in Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02"></a>
*   Losing and finding a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04"></a>
*   Having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06"></a>
*   Death and inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07"></a>
*   Starting and running a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09"></a>
*   Seriously ill children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12"></a>
*   Starting and running a voluntary organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14"></a>

The mission approach is used for these cross-sectoral challenges, requiring collective and targeted efforts from public, private, and voluntary sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22"></a>. This innovation combines ambitious top-down goals with broad bottom-up efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50"></a>. Foresight is applied to future-proof services by analyzing driving forces for change, potential impacts, and developing future personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:26"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:28"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:36"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50"></a>.

## Ensuring Missions are Future-Ready

### Foresight and Co-creation
Missions are inherently future-oriented, setting broad objectives with timelines to provide direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:45"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50"></a>. The process of co-creating missions by different actors is key to achieving shared objectives and commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25"></a>. Approaches vary, from formal governance structures (e.g., Japan's visionary council including a science fiction novelist) to online consultations and workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:57"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:10"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:15"></a>. While missions are about the future, formal foresight practices are not always consistently integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:33"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00"></a>.

Foresight helps detach discussions from present obstacles and focus on future needs and opportunities, fostering an innovative space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:09"></a>. It also helps account for future users and generations, which may differ significantly from current ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:06"></a>.

### Adaptive Governance and Processes
To maintain dynamism, missions require flexible, agile, and iterative practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:07"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:21"></a>. Key elements include:
*   **Robust Governance**: Setting up a governance system that allows for micro-changes and regular monitoring and evaluation of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:28"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:36"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:40"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:45"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07"></a>. This includes reoccurring meetings with senior government officials to identify political barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:53"></a>.
*   **Learning Mindset**: Financing and investment plans should allow for partnerships to adapt, integrate new partners, and embrace a "learning mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:10"></a>.
*   **Portfolio Approach**: Rather than focusing on single projects, a portfolio of interconnected projects that contribute to the broader mission allows for flexibility and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:24"></a>.
*   **Iterative Reviews**: Periodic stress testing of missions ensures they remain relevant and avoids lock-in to initial assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:38"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:01"></a>. These reviews should have a future perspective, not just retrospective evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:54"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:56"></a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Political Commitment and Funding
Securing political commitment for long-term missions, especially beyond leaders' terms of office, is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:21"></a>. Emphasizing broad agreement, citizen buy-in, establishing clear decision points, and demonstrating potential for investment beyond initial funding streams can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:37"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:24"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:48"></a>. Missions must also be designed to attract diverse funding sources beyond government budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:39"></a>.

### Incumbent Bias and New Actors
Co-creation of missions can lead to incumbent bias, where existing players dominate discussions based on current interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:07"></a>. Counteracting this requires:
*   **Challenging Assumptions**: Actively including partners with completely different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:53"></a>.
*   **International Collaboration**: Encouraging cross-border cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:58"></a>.
*   **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Including social sciences and humanities alongside technological expertise to understand behavioral aspects and consumer shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:20"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:30"></a>.
*   **Engaging Emerging Actors**: Actively seeking out and bringing in new actors from "Horizon 2" and "Horizon 3" to challenge existing norms and foster true transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:26"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:29"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:33"></a>.

### Managing Failure
The concept of "failure" in missions is complex; it's not a binary outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21"></a>. Missions, by their disruptive nature, will have aspects that succeed and some that don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04"></a>. Performance measurement systems need to be attuned to allow for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40"></a>. A "culture of cooperation" where blame is not attached is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57"></a>.

Lessons from past missions, such as the internet's development, show that even when initial goals are not fully met, significant side effects and new technologies can emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01"></a>.
*   **Reflectivity and Learning**: Evaluation is essential to learn from failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18"></a>.
*   **Exit Strategies**: Having an exit strategy can prevent brutal termination of missions and allow for activities to be reformed or repurposed, reducing sunk costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34"></a>.

### Intergenerational Fairness and Well-being
A critical aspect of future missions is addressing intergenerational fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:09"></a>. Questions arise regarding who benefits and who pays across generations for large-scale investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:40"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:45"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:48"></a>. Youth, particularly sensitive to [[impact of COVID19 on vulnerable groups | climate change]], demand representation in discussions about their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:30"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:34"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:36"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:48"></a>.

Integrating foresight into mission planning helps move beyond current problems to consider future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24"></a>. This includes designing processes for deep and effective participation and representation, such as Japan's public dialogues that include perspectives for people born in 2060 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51"></a>. Engaging the next generation of foresight practitioners, who are often young people transforming their communities, is also vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18"></a>.

Many current climate missions are heavily focused on technological solutions, often neglecting the behavioral dimension and changes to social norms, which could lead to a "wake-up call" if societal habits are not addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39"></a>. Integrating well-being and behavioral dimensions directly into missions from the outset can enable a smoother transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01"></a>.

### Breaking Silos
Missions often cut across traditional governmental silos, but ensuring synergy between diverse goals like climate and well-being remains a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:58"></a>. Mission-oriented innovation requires linking various players—research, commercial, public sector, and political systems—to address overarching targets and identify policy barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18"></a>. Organizations like the OPSI's Mission Action Lab are working on implementation tasks to break these silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24"></a>.

## Personal Commitments for the Future
Panelists shared personal commitments for future work:
*   **Staying Open to Change**: Continued openness to new ways of working and collaborating, ensuring that lessons from [[lessons_learned_from_the_covid19_crisis_and_the_future_of_public_sector_resilience | the pandemic]] are consciously carried forward, rather than returning to old norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:46"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56"></a>.
*   **Courage and Pace**: Maintaining courage in doing things differently and at a fast pace, as there is no existing blueprint for solving complex problems like food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:19"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:36"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:38"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:54"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05"></a>.
*   **Building Trust and Extending Ownership**: Recognizing the power of sharing information to build trust and extend ownership in mission-oriented endeavors, as exemplified by the European experience with vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:39"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:43"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:47"></a>.
*   **Intergenerational Solidarity**: Continuing to ask if decisions and investments are intergenerationally fair, aiming to foster solidarity rather than conflict across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:28"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:36"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:44"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:46"></a>.
*   **Action Research and Implementation Focus**: Engaging in more action research and practice-based research within the mission action lab, providing advice to missions while simultaneously learning from their implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:39"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:43"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:45"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51"></a>.
*   **Developing Practical Tools**: Committing to developing practical tools and methods applicable across different mission fields for countries by next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:11"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20"></a>.

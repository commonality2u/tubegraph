[[public_trust_and_governance | Building trust in public services]] is a central and urgent agenda in today's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:20">[02:07:20]</a>. The ability of governments to provide quality services and ensure inclusion directly reflects citizens' [[building_public_trust_in_institutions | trust in institutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Improving people's lives is the ultimate goal of innovation in public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

## Why Innovation is Key to Trust

The OECD's global trends report on government innovation, particularly focused on public services, emphasizes the need to "put the public back into public services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. [[innovation_in_public_services | Innovation in public services]] is no longer optional; it's essential for addressing complex challenges like inequality, climate change, and digital transformation, and for [[building_and_maintaining_public_trust | building trust]] as the state addresses citizens' needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Governments are pursuing various objectives through innovation, including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>:
*   Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>
*   Increasing public satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>
*   Helping uptake of services, especially for populations facing access challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>
*   Ensuring fairness and equal treatment in the government-citizen relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>

## Human-Centricity as a Foundation

A core principle for building trust is placing people at the center of public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This requires a cultural shift in bureaucracy, moving from a product-based view to one centered on "life events" and "life journeys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>.

### Examples of Human-Centric Approaches:

*   **Brazil** emphasizes that innovation must be human-centered, ensuring public services are not only efficient but also inclusive and transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. The national digital government strategy was developed collaboratively, involving public servants, experts, and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
*   **Portugal**'s national digital strategy aims for public services to proactively meet citizens' and businesses' needs, enhancing efficiency and reducing bureaucracy by consistently putting users at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. Their Lab X, a center for innovation in the public sector, fosters experimentation, testing, and continuous improvement through research, co-creation with citizens and other stakeholders, and testing solutions before full implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.
*   **Canada** has adopted digital standards that require openness in tool development and invite users to be part of the design and implementation of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:00">[31:17:00]</a>.

## Fostering Transparency and Accountability

[[trust_and_transparency_in_public_governance | Trust and transparency in public governance]] are enhanced when governments demonstrate accountability and clear processes.

### Practical Applications:

*   **Brazil**'s K collabor program centralizes personal management, procurement, and budget execution in a single agency, committing to transparency and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>.
*   **Canada** is experimenting with a money-back guarantee for passport services, a first for their public service, demonstrating "skin in the game" and a commitment to service quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>. Reducing errors in benefit programs, like the old age benefits transformation, also builds trust by ensuring essential financial support is received correctly and avoiding later financial pressures from overpayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:12:00">[32:12:00]</a>.

## Ensuring Inclusion and Accessibility

[[trust_and_engagement_in_public_governance | Public participation and trust in urban governance]] are crucial, and innovation must ensure no citizen is excluded from the benefits of digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:16:00">[42:16:00]</a>.

### Initiatives for Inclusion:

*   **Brazil**'s gobbr digital identity allows 160 million citizens (75% of the population) to access over 2,500 digital public services easily, agilely, and transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. They are also building a unified early childhood registry to integrate various data sources (social assistance, school enrollment, vaccines, food security) into a single platform for individualized monitoring and effective public policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. Innovation also aids inclusion by addressing gender and race issues, with programs training women and black women for leadership positions and integrating these themes into civil servant training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   **Portugal** focuses on preventing exclusion due to lack of digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:39:00">[43:39:00]</a>. Their "citizen spots" network (over 930 across Portugal) provides direct and mediated support to access digital services and serves as learning hubs for citizens to gain digital confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:10:00">[44:10:00]</a>. The national civic engagement platform, participle.gov.pt, allows citizens to transparently propose and vote on ideas and monitor public decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:05:00">[47:05:00]</a>.
*   **Canada** acknowledges unequal service access across its large country and invests in digital infrastructure to ensure all Canadians can access services regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>. They also aim to adapt program language and interface quality for ease of use across various digital devices, fostering digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:37:00">[33:37:00]</a>.

## Enhancing Efficiency and Effectiveness

Improving efficiency and effectiveness of public services contributes directly to [[building_and_maintaining_public_trust | public trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

### Streamlining Processes:

*   The **European Union** aims for a 25% reduction in reporting obligations for companies, translating to savings of up to 37 billion euros annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:19:00">[22:19:00]</a>. Key to this is implementing the "once-only principle," where businesses and individuals are asked for information only once, with administrations handling data exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>. This requires full interoperability between public administrations and countries, harmonizing standards, and ensuring data is machine-readable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>.
*   The EU promotes a "data-driven public administration" that works with data rather than through documents, allowing seamless data flow between administrative layers and across countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>.

## Advice for Building Trust through Innovation

[[the_role_of_ai_and_technology_in_public_administration | The role of AI and technology in public administration]] is a rapidly developing area, with governments exploring its potential to enhance public services, drive economic development, and foster [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]]. Serbia's National AI Supercomputing Platform stands out as a key example of a public sector initiative aimed at leveraging AI for national growth and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.

## Serbia's Journey in GovTech and AI
Serbia embarked on a significant tech revolution in 2017, with a strategic shift towards a knowledge and [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]]-driven economy, powered by technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>. This focus has led to the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector becoming the largest net exporting sector in Serbia, with every second job created in the country in the ICT sector in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.

Serbia has made notable progress in GovTech, ranking among the top 10 countries globally for e-government progress according to the United Nations e-Government Development Index, and fourth in Europe and eleventh worldwide in the World Bank's GovTech Maturity Index in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. This progress is partly attributed to a deliberate effort to create an environment where Serbian minds can develop their ideas domestically, addressing a historical challenge where talented individuals like Nikola Tesla had to seek opportunities abroad due to a lack of infrastructure and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

## National AI Supercomputing Platform
A major pillar of Serbia's [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | digital transformation]] and [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]] strategy is the development of its artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.

### Key Components of Serbia's AI Ecosystem
*   **National AI Strategy:** Serbia was the first country in Southeastern Europe and the 26th globally to adopt a national AI strategy in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
*   **AI Institute:** Established in 2021, this research and development organization employs over 40 researchers, many of whom are Serbian talents returning from abroad, focusing on areas such as computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and AI in healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>.
*   **Support for AI R&D:** National Science and Innovation funds actively support numerous AI research and development programs, companies, and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.
*   **Education:** Serbia is one of only 11 countries worldwide with an AI program implemented in primary and secondary education. The country also offers five Master's programs in AI, with plans to expand to seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.
*   **Public Sector Implementations:** There have been successful implementations of AI in public sector domains, particularly in energy and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. Data science and AI subjects are also part of the National Academy for Public Administration's program for civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>.

### The AI Supercomputing Platform
In 2020, the Serbian government established the National AI Platform within its State Data Center in Kragujevac, one of the largest and most sophisticated data centers in Southeastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. This platform provides the essential computational infrastructure required for AI product development, which is typically expensive and hard to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.

*   **Technical Details:** The supercomputer is an Nvidia-based cluster, installed in December 2021, and includes a fast machine learning engine with a graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies the use of its computational resources for data management and workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Accessibility and Impact:** The government made a "fantastic decision" to offer the platform free of charge to all stakeholders in the Serbian AI ecosystem, including faculties, science and technology institutes, and startup companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. This significantly reduces the financial barrier for startups, as hosting similar projects on commercial cloud AI platforms could cost up to 10,000-20,000 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. The AI Institute was the first user, already collaborating with multinational companies like Continental, NCR, and Takeda, using the platform for their projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. Currently, 24 institutions and 19 startup companies utilize the platform, with over 200 user accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>.
*   **Efficiency and Environmental Considerations:** This centralized platform serves as a catalyst for economic development in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. By allowing businesses and individuals to leverage the government's supercomputing power instead of setting up their own data centers and server hosting, it inadvertently contributes to reducing the overall carbon footprint associated with data storage and processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>.

### Future Plans
Serbia plans to launch another public call for startups in the second quarter of the year, providing theoretical and hands-on training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. The country is also fostering its AI and GovTech ecosystem through international collaboration:
*   **Euro HPC:** Membership provides opportunities to learn from European peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>.
*   **Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI):** Recent membership aims to build partnerships around AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.
*   **Digital Euro Program:** Serbia will join this program and work jointly on GovTech projects with Gothic Crawl consortia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.
*   **GovTech Program:** In cooperation with GIZ and the World Bank, a sustainable system of [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation in the public sector]] will be launched through collaboration with innovative companies, universities, and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>.
*   **Innovation Fund:** A dedicated grant competition for GovTech startups is forthcoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.
*   **Bilateral Partnerships:** Serbia cherishes bilateral partnerships in AI and GovTech, with particularly advanced collaboration with the United Arab Emirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.

The Serbian government views its AI platform and broader AI ecosystem as a crucial step in transforming the way it designs and develops services for citizens and responds to societal needs, by embracing new approaches and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

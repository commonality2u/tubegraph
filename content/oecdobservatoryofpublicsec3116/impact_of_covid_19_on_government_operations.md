The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered and presented new challenges and opportunities for government operations globally. Discussions among leading officials from the EU, France, the United States, and the OECD highlight key lessons and necessary transformations for public administration.

## Initial State of Public Administration Before the Pandemic
Before the pandemic, public administration in many countries had been "eroded" and weakened over two decades due to a series of crises, including the financial and sovereign crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:11">[03:36:11]</a>. This period saw limited possibilities for renewal, improvement, and training, leading to a loss of experienced civil servants through retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:04">[03:59:04]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities Presented by the Pandemic
The pandemic created a "critical moment" for public administration, facing a dual challenge:
*   A "weakened kind of skeleton" of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>.
*   New challenges demanding focus on digital transformation, greening economies, and a more cohesive societal approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:19">[04:52:19]</a>.

Despite these challenges, the pandemic also created an opportunity for significant change:
*   **New Funding and Support** Substantial new funding and technical support, such as the EU's Technical Support Instrument and Recovery and Resilience Plans, provide avenues to reshape and reorganize civil services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:15">[05:22:15]</a>.
*   **Boost for Recovery** The recovery period offers a chance to build back better, creating a more agile, flexible, and fit-for-purpose administrative structure at central, regional, and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:42">[38:46:42]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Accelerated Trends
The pandemic accelerated existing trends in government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:21">[16:45:21]</a>:
*   **Whole-of-Government Approach** There is a critical need to operate in a "whole of government" or horizontal manner, breaking down traditional silos between programs, budgets, and organizational structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:03">[17:01:03]</a>. This requires developing the right skills and capabilities at the center of government for effective coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:37">[17:31:37]</a>.
*   **Vertical Optimization and Feedback Mechanisms** Governments must optimize vertically by creating feedback mechanisms that allow senior leadership to better understand frontline issues and the experiences of the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:19">[18:00:19]</a>. This involves listening to those delivering services on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:03">[18:15:03]</a>.
*   **Adaptable Policy-Making and Implementation** Policy-making and implementation routines need to be constantly adapted, as annual reviews are insufficient for the fluid nature of current challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:01">[19:42:01]</a>.
*   **Surge in Innovation** The pandemic led to an undeniable surge in innovation, including increased adoption of digital government, rapid upskilling and reallocation of public servants, and an opening of governments to ideas from the third sector to ensure service continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:35">[23:19:35]</a>. At the beginning of the crisis, approximately 60% of civil servants in OECD countries were teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:04">[23:36:04]</a>.
*   **Significant Public Spending** Governments worldwide maintained societies and economies afloat through substantial public spending, estimated at about 26% of GDP in OECD countries during the first year of the [[Challenges faced by governments in the Covid19 crisis | crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:35">[22:29:35]</a>.
*   **Valuing the Workforce** The pandemic highlighted the critical role of the public sector workforce, which often goes unrecognized in day-to-day operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:41:55">[39:41:55]</a>. Supporting the workforce should be a consistent focus for leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:39:13">[41:39:13]</a>.

## Moving Towards Future-Oriented Governance
The consensus is that governments must learn from the [[Challenges faced by governments during the pandemic | crisis]] and take concrete action to steer towards a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. This involves:
*   **Systematic Innovation** Carrying forward the innovative momentum from the pandemic and systematically building the public service's capacity to use innovation for future challenges, especially [[Pandemic impact on government practices | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:35">[23:53:35]</a>.
*   **Strategic Digital Transformation** Digital transformation is central to the agenda, but it requires reshaping the entire administration, not just electronically replicating old systems, to avoid creating new digital divides that isolate vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:45:21">[34:45:21]</a>.
*   **Focus on Inclusion and Equality** Governments must integrate systematic approaches to gather diverse perspectives in decision-making and better promote equality and inclusion, as crises disproportionately affect different groups and can increase inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:44:03">[42:44:03]</a>. This includes considering generational impacts, geographic location, and social belonging to ensure equal access to public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:17:15">[53:17:15]</a>.
*   **Investing in Foundations** Governments must invest in the foundations of their governing systems to drive innovation, harness new opportunities, and remain resilient and adaptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:47:04">[57:47:04]</a>.
*   **Cross-Border Collaboration** Enhancing [[Impact of COVID19 on international cooperation | cross-border collaboration]] and knowledge exchange among countries is crucial for addressing global challenges that transcend national boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:24">[24:51:24]</a>.

Ultimately, the recovery from [[Impact of COVID19 on government roles | COVID-19]] presents a unique opportunity for governments to transform their actions, organization, and operations to avoid returning to the "old normal" and to shape a future with equal opportunities for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:46:16">[59:46:16]</a>.

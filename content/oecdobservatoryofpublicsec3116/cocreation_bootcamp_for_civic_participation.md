The co-creation bootcamp brought together 100 individuals from the public sector, private sector, academia, and civil society organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its primary goal was to [[tools_and_approaches_for_implementing_cocreation_in_public_sector | co-create solutions]] to civic participation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These challenges were presented by public sector teams from Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands, who committed to collaborating with society to address them by leveraging [[emerging_technologies_in_civic_engagement | emerging technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The challenges tackled aimed to prioritize people, utilizing technologies such as AI, blockchain, and VR to enhance [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | democratic participation]], making governance more inclusive and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Design Sprint Process

To transition from identified challenges to [[prototyping_ideas_in_civic_tech | prototype solutions]], participants worked in teams and followed a process designed by the OECD, structured as a design sprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Day 1

#### Align on the Challenge
The initial step involved teams aligning on the specific challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This required understanding not only the problem itself but also its context and any previous attempts to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Teams identified key [[cocreation_and_stakeholder_engagement_in_mission_setting | stakeholders]] and users, potential barriers to implementation, and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This process ensured a shared understanding and a clear direction for moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

#### Ideation of Solutions
With a clear understanding of the challenges, teams moved into ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. They quickly brainstormed, discarded, and discussed ideas, generating solutions while prioritizing them to address the challenge effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The most popular ideas were developed into well-articulated solution sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

#### Refine and Select
After sketching and discussing, teams refined their ideas, narrowing down possibilities to select one idea for [[prototyping_ideas_in_civic_tech | prototyping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Day 2

#### Prototyping
Day two was dedicated entirely to developing the selected idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Teams started by developing a minimal [[prototyping_ideas_in_civic_tech | prototype canvas]] based on their sketches from the previous day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They explored various approaches, some utilizing digital tools and [[emerging_technologies_in_civic_engagement | emerging technologies]], while others opted for traditional materials like Legos and modeling clay to quickly create a tangible representation of their solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

#### Final Pitches
As time concluded, teams prepared for final pitches of their solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. They showcased their two-day work in five minutes to other participants and a jury of experts from Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, and the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Three solutions were selected for further development, recognized as prototypes that pushed the boundaries of civic participation with [[emerging_technologies_in_civic_engagement | emerging technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

These developed ideas are expected to shape the future of civic participation across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

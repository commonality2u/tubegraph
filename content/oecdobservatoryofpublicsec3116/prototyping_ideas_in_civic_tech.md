Prototyping ideas in civic tech involves a structured approach to developing tangible solutions for challenges in civic participation, often leveraging [[emerging_technologies_in_civic_engagement | emerging technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A [[cocreation_bootcamp_for_civic_participation | co-creation boot camp]] brought together 100 individuals from the public sector, private sector, academia, and civil society to co-create solutions for civic participation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These challenges were presented by public sector teams from Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The objective was to put people at the center, using technologies such as AI, blockchain, and VR as tools to enhance democratic participation and make governance more inclusive and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Design Sprint Process

The journey from a challenge to prototype solutions followed a process designed by the OECD, structured as a [[design_sprint_process_for_developing_solutions | design sprint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Step 1: Align on the Challenge
The initial step for teams was to align on the specific civic participation challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This involved a deep understanding of the problem itself, its context, and any previous attempts to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Teams also identified key stakeholders and users, potential implementation barriers, and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This ensured a shared understanding of the challenge and a clear direction for moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Step 2: Ideation
With a clear understanding of the challenges, teams moved into the ideation phase to brainstorm solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This involved quickly brainstorming, discarding, and discussing ideas to generate and prioritize potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Step 3: Solution Sketching
The most promising ideas were further developed into well-articulated solution sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Teams created quick drawings to give shape and form to their solutions on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Step 4: Refinement and Selection
After sketching and discussing, teams refined their ideas, narrowing down the possibilities to select one idea for prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Step 5: Prototyping
The second day of the boot camp was entirely dedicated to developing the selected idea into a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Minimal Prototype Canvas**: Teams began by developing a minimal prototype canvas based on their sketches from the previous day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Tools and Materials**: Different approaches were used for prototyping. Some teams utilized digital tools and [[emerging_technologies_in_civic_engagement | emerging technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, while others opted for traditional materials like Legos and modeling clay to achieve a tangible representation of the solution as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Final Pitches and Future Development
At the end of the process, teams prepared final pitches to showcase what they had built over two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. They presented their solutions in 5 minutes to other participants and a jury of experts from Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Following the pitches, three solutions were chosen for further development, selected for their ability to push the boundaries of civic participation using [[emerging_technologies_in_civic_engagement | emerging technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The ideas developed through this process are intended to shape the future of civic participation across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

[[public_sector_innovation_introduction | Public sector innovation]] is a timely and crucial topic, particularly as governments navigate the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and address future challenges like climate change and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has long recognized this topic as crucial, alongside its knowledge base and the participation of knowledgeable experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Context and Challenges for Public Administration

The past two decades have seen a series of crises, including a financial crisis leading to a sovereign crisis, and then the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. During this period, public administration in many countries and regions was often eroded, with limited possibilities for renewal, improvement, or training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Consequently, it became weaker, with experienced civil servants retiring or leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Many member states and regions in Europe and beyond face a critical situation regarding their public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

On top of this, new funding, such as strong funding to boost recovery based on digital transformation, greening, and a more cohesive approach, presents a dual challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. Governments face the challenge of having a weakened public administration skeleton while simultaneously confronting new demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

## Opportunities for [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | Innovation in the Public Sector]]

Despite the challenges, there is a significant opportunity to reshape the capacity and institutional capability of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. New financial and technical support, including the Technical Support Instrument managed at the European level and Recovery and Resilience Plans, provide avenues to reorganize the civil service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This allows for managing massive financial opportunities towards recovery within a new framework, leveraging new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. Member states have requested support, highlighting the central role of public administration in enabling regions, especially the weakest, to catch up and achieve a more resilient and sustainable path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

The focus on the quality of public administration and the need for a good institutional framework is a precondition for convergence and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

### Poll Results: Public Willingness vs. Government Action
A poll revealed an audience that is very committed to applying conference learnings in their organizations (42% very committed, 37% committed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. However, there's significant skepticism about government action post-COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>:
*   **32%** believe governments are willing and ready to learn and take action towards a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   **50%** think lessons will be recognized, but no concrete action will be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **17.5%** believe governments will do nothing and stick to the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
This indicates a fear that concrete action, particularly for long-term issues like climate change, may not be taken, given governments' tendency to focus on short-term problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from the Pandemic and [[public_sector_innovation_trends | Public Sector Innovation Trends]]

The pandemic accelerated existing trends in government, similar to the private sector and personal lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Dustin Brown, Deputy Assistant Director for Management at the Office of Management and Budget, identified three key lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>:

1.  **Whole-of-Government Operations**: Governments must operate horizontally, breaking down silos across programs, budgets, and organizational structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This requires ensuring the right skills and capabilities exist within the center of government to coordinate efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Vertical Optimization and Feedback Mechanisms**: Historically, the focus has been on top-down compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. The future of government necessitates listening and creating feedback mechanisms to bring frontline issues to senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. An example is the US government's first-ever government-wide pulse survey for almost two million employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
3.  **Adaptive Policy Making and Implementation Routines**: Governments need to convene people with the necessary frequency to adapt policies and implementation approaches based on the experiences of the workforce, managers, and the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Annual routines are too slow for the pace of change, requiring mechanisms to adjust given the fluid nature of challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

Elza Pilikowski, Director for Public Governance at the OECD, further highlighted that the pandemic, while placing increased pressure on governments, led to an undeniable surge in [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Examples include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>:
*   Increased uptake of digital government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   Rapid upskilling and reallocation of public servants to urgent tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   Sixty percent of civil servants teleworking at the start of the crisis across the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   Opening governments to ideas from the third sector to ensure continuity and supply of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Goals for Future-Oriented Governance and [[public_sector_innovation_fundamentals | Public Sector Innovation Fundamentals]]

The OECD Public Governance Committee's mandate for 2020-2024 emphasizes increasing trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. This focus is built on three areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>:
1.  The people governments serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
2.  The workforce that serves them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
3.  The policies and routines that drive government culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

This evidence-based approach aims to improve trust in government, achieve results that matter to the public, and strengthen democratic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

It is essential to carry forward this innovative momentum and systematically build the public service's capacity to use [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] to respond to future challenges, particularly climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. This requires embedding innovation capacity within institutions and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Addressing Inequality and Promoting Inclusion
Crises disproportionately affect people and often increase inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Rethinking [[public_sector_innovation_methods_and_strategies | public governance tools]] is crucial to address inequality, especially with future crises like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Young people, for example, have been particularly affected by the pandemic and show increasing dissatisfaction with how democracies function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

Countries need to integrate systematic approaches to gather diverse perspectives in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. The Netherlands' "generation check" to evaluate policy impact across generations is an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. Future governance models need flexibility and decision-making mechanisms to accommodate minority voices and consider future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## [[public_sector_innovation_methods_and_strategies | Public Sector Innovation Strategies]]

Discussions from the conference highlighted several strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>:
*   **Designing Ambitious Missions**: Governments can design and structure ambitious missions to tackle the climate crisis and achieve climate targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Creative Foresight Exercises**: These are vital not only to envision the future but also to build the necessary skills and competencies for the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Pushing Innovation Beyond Administrative Boundaries**: Enhancing [[public_sector_innovation_and_collaboration | cross-border collaboration]] is crucial in the face of global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Inclusive Policy Design**: Deliberately integrating inclusive policy design helps build better policies for all and increases trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   **Investing in Governance Foundations**: It is important for governments to invest now in the foundations of their governing systems to drive [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], harness new opportunities, and remain resilient and adaptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. This includes promoting more inclusive citizen involvement in policy making and representation of diverse interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   **Supporting the Workforce**: Public entities must recognize their workforce as their most important asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. Leadership should focus on supporting the workforce in day-to-day operations, as they are on the front lines, directly interacting with citizens and delivering the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

### The Role of Digital Transformation
Digital transformation is at the center of the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. However, this fast technological change requires reshaping the entire way administration is managed and organized, not just replicating old bureaucratic systems electronically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. It's crucial to avoid creating a "digital divide" where segments of the population are cut off from basic public services due to location, capacity, or educational capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This requires careful, detailed, and place-based approaches to manage opportunities while ensuring no increase in regional and social divides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

## European Union's Role in [[public_sector_innovation_and_collaboration | Public Sector Innovation and Collaboration]]

The European Commission is working with member states, providing technical support, often subcontracting to experts, to support reforms in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. This includes strengthening government capacity for gender-sensitive and inclusive recovery, assessing public expenditure with a gender dimension, and addressing employment gender gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

The EU is also exploring a more horizontal program to exchange experiences and even civil servants, aiming to create a common culture for improving public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. This is part of ensuring that generational gaps, geographical location, and social belonging are not associated with unequal access to public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

The Technical Support Instrument and Recovery and Resilience Plans offer significant opportunities for member states to "build back better" by developing more agile, flexible, and fit-for-purpose administrative structures at central, regional, and local levels, which is essential for sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Path Forward

The COVID-19 crisis forced governments to change, and the recovery presents an opportunity to transform government action, organization, and operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. "Governing differently" should be the next priority to avoid reverting to old norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. Governments should use the recovery to shape a future with equal opportunities for everyone, where major challenges like climate transition and digital transformation benefit all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

As leaders and change-makers, it's crucial to step outside comfort zones, challenge the status quo, and push the boundaries of government with passion, courage, and tenacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. The momentum from discussions needs to translate into commitments and actions that pave the way for a public sector that remains fit for the future and continues to drive positive results for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

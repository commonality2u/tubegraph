[[public_sector_innovation | Public sector innovation]] focuses on improving public services and government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This field aims to demystify the process of innovation and reveal what it truly takes to succeed, moving beyond the celebration of grand triumphs to acknowledge the underlying failures and false starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## The Observatory for Public Sector Innovation (OPSI)

The Observatory for [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) was founded in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. OPSI works closely with the European Commission and innovation groups globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, focusing on:
*   **Uncovering What's Next:** Identifying innovative practices at the edge of government, whether in OECD or non-OECD countries, national or sub-national <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Providing Trusted Advice:** Working directly with governments to identify contextual and system-specific barriers to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This often involves applying systems thinking to solve problems and emerging issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Integrating into the New Normal:** Developing frameworks and methods to help countries understand and conceptualize innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The goal is to establish a shared understanding of innovation, given that many people have different definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## The Innovation Lifecycle

OPSI outlines an [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] lifecycle that includes several key phases:
1.  **Identifying Problems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>
2.  **Generating Ideas (Ideation)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>
3.  **Developing Proposals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>
4.  **Implementation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>
5.  **Evaluation and Diffusing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

## Problem Framing

Problem framing, often represented by a double diamond design model, involves two main phases: problem definition and creating solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. These phases are broken into sub-phases: discover, investigate, identify options, and validate and recommend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

A common challenge in the public sector is that civil servants often begin their work after the "investigate" phase, being given a problem that is already defined, or even a solution that only needs implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This can lead to negative results and projects that fail to deliver expected value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. It is crucial to spend more time in problem framing, even if a specific problem has been assigned, to fully understand its context before moving to the solution space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Even in a political environment where politicians may come in with pre-defined solutions, there is always room to find areas to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Innovation isn't just about radical transformation; it also includes incremental changes and improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Ideation

Ideation, the generation of ideas, is more than just forming concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. In [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] processes, it involves finding the best ideas from internal or external sources, and then screening and prioritizing those ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. It is not merely a brainstorming activity in a closed room filled with post-it notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

Ideation is deeply connected to the type of problem being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. It can involve:
*   Solving concrete issues by exploring many different options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   Signaling to citizens or companies the problems of interest to generate solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   Creating expectations for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

### Mythbusting: Creativity in the Public Sector

A common misconception is that public sector employees are not creative enough to ideate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. However, [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is rarely the result of a lone innovator; it is very much a team effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

Major enemies of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and ideation include:
*   **Groupthink:** When people spend too much time together and start to think alike, reducing constructive conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This can be countered by involving diverse stakeholders, rotating people in teams, and being open to different ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Lack of Diversity:** Creativity thrives when individuals with different backgrounds, experiences, and ways of thinking interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   **Limited Experience:** Creativity is a resource that needs to be created; people become more creative by having experience with innovative or creative projects and opportunities to test ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

Creativity is not just about inventing entirely new ideas but also about "adaptive creativity" â€“ finding existing solutions and applying them in new contexts or industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. Reading diverse materials and constantly challenging assumptions also fosters creative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

### Facets of Public Sector Innovation

[[facets_of_public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] can be viewed across two dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>:

1.  **Type of Uncertainty:**
    *   **Exploratory Phase (High Uncertainty):** Dealing with new technologies (like AI or blockchain) where solutions and options are unknown, but there's great promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
    *   **Exploiting Phase / Incremental Innovation (Certainty):** Making existing systems more effective or efficient, leveraging existing knowledge and adapting novel ideas to a specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

2.  **Directive/Demand:**
    *   **Clear Directive (Top-Down):** A clear, mission-driven problem needs to be solved (e.g., education reform, making tax systems more effective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Expected outcomes are clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
    *   **Adaptive Innovation (User-Driven/Bottom-Up):** Experimenting based on feedback from citizens experiencing public services, allowing for quick adjustments without top leadership involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

The type of ideas sought and their sources vary significantly depending on these quadrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. For high uncertainty areas, signals from external partners (developers, experts) are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. For design-oriented or citizen-oriented problems, stakeholders like citizens themselves are the primary source of good ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

### Assessing Innovation Readiness and Overcoming Bias

It's vital to "love the problem" to understand why one is innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. This requires an objective, critical, and outside voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Expert Bias:** Experts, even when unsatisfied with outcomes, might resist looking for new ways of doing things, especially in the ideation phase where expanding options is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. This bias can be managed by:
    *   Directly engaging experts with the problem and affected citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
    *   Framing discussions around desired outcomes rather than just problems, which can create urgency if current results are unsatisfactory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.
    *   Using good facilitation to encourage participants to set aside their "expert hats" and view problems from a fresh perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

### Addressing Leadership Misalignment ("Innovation Theater")

A common challenge is leaders who "talk the talk" about [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] but do not "walk the walk," failing to provide resources or actively supporting the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. This is often not malicious but stems from a lack of full understanding of the innovation process, which differs significantly from traditional ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

To bridge this gap:
*   Engage in user-driven and incremental innovation, initiating "proof of case" projects to demonstrate the benefits of new approaches to high-level leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.
*   Highlight that innovation can happen through "pet projects" on the side, which, if successful, can gain broader support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.
*   Objective, third-party organizations like OPSI can influence this dynamic by emphasizing the importance of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

### Practical Applications: Ideation Checklist

A basic checklist can help ensure ideation is appropriate and systematic:
1.  **Problem Framing:** Have you spent enough time truly understanding and "falling in love with" the problem before moving to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>? Avoid rushing to solutions based on minimal data, which can lead to project failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.
2.  **Innovation Environment:** Do you understand the context (top-down vs. bottom-up, leadership resistance, political/organizational environment, outside actors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>? For problems like changing people's behavior, stakeholder buy-in and cooperation are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
3.  **Strategy Match:** Does your ideation strategy align with your environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>? For emergent problems with high uncertainty, broad strategies like crowdsourcing or public consultations are useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. For more concrete problems with less uncertainty, a smaller, select group may suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. For wicked problems (e.g., homelessness), deep engagement and co-creation with specific representative groups are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
4.  **Inclusivity:** Does your strategy allow everyone to contribute, recognizing different working styles (e.g., not just extroverts) and allowing time for ideas to develop over days or weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>?
5.  **Diverse Group:** Do you have a diverse group with varied backgrounds, thinking styles, and gender to prevent groupthink and generate fresh ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>?

This checklist helps in self-assessment to guide the ideation and problem-defining processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.

### Sifting and Filtering Ideas

After generating numerous ideas, the crucial next step is to narrow them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>. Transparency in the selection process is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.

Common, simplified methods like scoring models (based on novelty, usefulness, value, risk, etc.) are often used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>, but a single model cannot universally filter ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>. The filtering criteria must align with the **purpose of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]**:
*   For **mission-oriented innovation** (e.g., solving poverty), consistency with the mission is paramount, even if the idea isn't novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.
*   For **anticipatory radical ideas** (exploring new technologies), legitimacy and risk might be less important initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.

Beware of "shark tanks" or pitch competitions, as these formats can favor the person's characteristics and selling ability over the idea's merit, potentially excluding valuable contributions from less assertive individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. It's crucial to explore diverse methods for filtering ideas to ensure an inclusive strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>. There isn't one "best" solution; the approach depends on the specific goals and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>.

### Organizational Capabilities and Workplace Civility

**Organizational capabilities** in innovation go beyond individual skills to include:
*   **Motivations:** Incentives for employees to engage in innovative activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.
*   **Opportunities:** Providing opportunities for individuals to build and practice innovative skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.
*   **Culture:** Fostering a culture where innovation is a normal part of work, not just a side activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>.
*   **Team Level:** Building great creative innovation teams with diverse backgrounds, as innovation is a team effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.

**Workplace civility** and its relationship with innovation and creativity is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. While innovation requires questioning the status quo, it should be done constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. Organizations need rules for professional disagreement, ensuring that debates are about content and ideas, not personal attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. A safe environment for disagreement is crucial for [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a>.

### Innovation in Emerging Countries

Emerging countries can be highly innovative because they often lack the institutional infrastructure and path dependency that can hinder radical innovation in developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. This allows them to make massive transformations and leaps, often bootstrapping solutions and testing many things due to limited investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>. They can move much faster in adopting new ways of operating because they are not locked down by established, institutionalized systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.

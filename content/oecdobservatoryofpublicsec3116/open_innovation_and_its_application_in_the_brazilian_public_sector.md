Open innovation is considered a valuable tool within the [[innovation in the public sector | public sector innovation]] system, recognizing that solutions may originate from outside government, drawing on external experiences from Brazil or globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>.

## Value and Application
Open innovation is particularly effective when there is a clear broad aim, allowing external parties to contribute solutions based on their diverse contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>. It can help explore various [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation facets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>.

## Limitations
However, the value of open innovation varies with context and the nature of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. It may be less suited for "anticipatory innovation" or "adaptive innovation" spaces where questions are less defined and more exploratory work is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>.

## Application in Brazil
Brazil is actively experimenting with [[innovation in the public sector | open innovation]] approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:53">[01:19:53]</a>.

### Challenge Platform Initiatives
A key initiative in Brazil is the creation of a challenge platform for public challenges, such as "DISA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>. This platform allows [[public_sector_innovation_and_collaboration | public sector]] organizations to:
*   Suggest specific challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.
*   Offer awards, including monetary incentives, for the best suggestions, answers, or prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>.
*   Provide additional funding for the better implementations of solutions selected in prior rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>.

These new platforms and methods aim to integrate [[innovation in the public sector | open innovation]] into [[Public Sector Innovation Introduction | public sector innovation]] discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>. They promote tools that enable organizations to experiment and invest in new ways of engaging:
*   The public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>
*   Society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>
*   Startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>
*   Companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>

This engagement helps in solving public problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:27">[01:21:27]</a>. This approach is viewed as a promising initiative, acknowledging that it involves "taking risks and making experimentations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.

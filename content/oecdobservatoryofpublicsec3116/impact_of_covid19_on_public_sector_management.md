The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced public sector management, driving a re-evaluation of skills, leadership, and organizational structures. The crisis has highlighted the need for public administrations to be more digital, flexible, and prepared for unexpected challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

## Immediate Shifts and Challenges
The [[Impact of COVID 19 on government operations | pandemic impact on government operations]] has taught several crucial lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. Contrary to stereotypes of being inflexible, public administration proved resilient during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. The immediate necessity was to adapt rapidly, particularly through the use of digital tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:41:00">[43:41:00]</a>. This period offered a historic opportunity to reshape the perception of public service as an attractive and agile workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.

However, challenges remain:
*   **Organizational Inertia** Public managers, while acknowledging lessons learned, may be less willing to change due to existing policies, precedents, and ingrained habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Change** Despite the evident need, there's a tendency to revert to the pre-COVID "old normal" status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>.
*   **Talent Acquisition** Governments face difficulties in bringing in diverse talent outside their traditional hiring processes, such as hiring designers instead of only economists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

## Skills for the Future Public Sector
The future of work in the public sector demands new and evolving skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Almost half of the current workforce will need to reskill in the next five years due to increasing technology adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Key skills include:
*   **Digital Literacy** Fundamental for navigating the modern work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.
*   **Soft Skills** Critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>, creative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>, teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>, empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>, and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a> are becoming increasingly vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>.
*   **Anticipation** Moving from planning the future based on past events to actively anticipating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:24:00">[55:24:00]</a>.

## New Ways of Working
The shift to a "new normal" in public administration involves several key changes:
*   **Hybrid Work Models** The ability to work remotely has proven effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. Many employees desire continued hybrid arrangements, combining remote work with office presence to maintain social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>.
*   **Focus on Results over Process** Management needs to shift from being process-driven to focusing on desired outcomes, especially with hybrid teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:29:00">[50:29:00]</a>.
*   **Flexible Working Arrangements** Implementing options like job sharing, concentrated working hours, and organized team rotations can enhance efficiency and employee well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:22:00">[41:22:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Tools for Collaboration** Platforms like Mural and Miro enable equitable participation and better organization of ideas in virtual environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.

## Leadership and Trust
Leadership is crucial for fostering an environment where talent can flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. The [[Impact of COVID19 on government roles | impact of COVID19 on government roles]] highlights:
*   **Distributed Leadership** Moving beyond centralized, top-down models to a more distributed and bottom-up leadership approach, potentially involving "shadow boards" of young people to give them power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:00">[34:27:00]</a>.
*   **Trust-Based Management** Leaders must build trust, as entities with higher levels of trust were faster and more efficient in deploying crisis measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:44:00">[49:44:00]</a>. This requires a social contract between managers and staff focusing on results and delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:54:00">[50:54:00]</a>.
*   **Creating Safe Environments** Fostering psychologically safe environments where staff can speak up freely and constructively, while balancing accountability for taxpayer money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:28:00">[52:28:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing Mistakes** Allowing space for errors and innovation without a "blame error culture" is essential for fostering creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:42:00">[51:42:00]</a>.

## Learning and Innovation
The [[Public Sector Innovation in Response to COVID19 | public sector innovation during COVID19]] has shown that learning must extend beyond the classroom and become a day-to-day activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:08:00">[38:08:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning** Emphasizing training programs on leadership, communication, crisis management, and digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:04:00">[32:04:00]</a>.
*   **Democratic Futures Thinking** Connecting public, people, and private sectors through collective intelligence to build the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.
*   **Competence Centers** Developing centralized "centers of excellence" for knowledge sharing, supporting digital literacy and information security awareness, and fostering collaborative training across diverse cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.
*   **"Everyone a Leader" Concept** Encouraging every individual to take ownership and do their best in their given roles, fostering trust and a bottom-up approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:48:00">[39:48:00]</a>.
*   **Citizen Engagement in Policy Making** Engaging citizens and civil society organizations more regularly in policy development through listening and co-creation modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>.
*   **Policy Silo Breaking** Thinking collaboratively across policy silos to address complex challenges like SDGs, recognizing that problems transcend traditional departmental boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>.

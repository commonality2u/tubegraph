The global COVID-19 pandemic presented an unprecedented time for governments worldwide, prompting significant learning and reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Discussions among government officials focused on identifying elements to abandon, retain, and adapt differently from the shock to the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Key themes that emerged included modernization, new reality, gratitude, leadership, and new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This article explores the [[challenges_and_responses_during_the_covid19_pandemic | government response strategies to COVID-19]] from the perspectives of the UAE, Montenegro, Estonia, and Indonesia.

## Initial Government Responses

### UAE: Speed and Agility
The UAE's [[government_response_to_covid19 | government response to COVID-19]] was characterized by "speed and agility," with a clear prioritization of health and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. All efforts were directed towards planning for the worst-case scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This included:
*   **Healthcare Mobilization**: Rapid rallying of healthcare resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Early Testing**: Being early adopters of drive-through testing and conducting massive amounts of tests to gather knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Food Security**: Reaping benefits from a 2017 initiative to establish a Minister of Food Security, which ensured strong storage capacity for food. This enabled the UAE to provide aid to approximately 120 countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Investment in Science and Technology**: Heavy investment in vaccine adoption, research, stem cell research, and tele-medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Economic Continuity**: Implementing stimulus packages and ensuring continuity of business, access to services, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The existing agile mindset within the government significantly contributed to this rapid adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Indonesia: Data-Driven and Adaptive
Indonesia, a highly populated country with 267 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, faced significant challenges in monitoring the virus's impact due to the lack of a single data system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The [[government_responses_to_covid19_and_innovation | government response to COVID-19]] rapidly developed:
*   **Integrated Data Platform**: Within the first month, a platform called "Fighting Against COVID-19" was developed to integrate data from 514 districts and cities across 34 provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Zonation and Monitoring**: This platform allowed for the creation of maps and zonations based on WHO indicators, used by all levels of leadership for monitoring and weekly updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Public Communication**: The data was used to drive public communications, with regular announcements on regional performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Domestic Production**: Initially facing a shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), Indonesia discovered it had the raw materials (polyester) and textile industry capacity to produce its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. This led to the development of domestically produced PPE that met international ISO standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

### Estonia: Responsive and Tech-Entrenched
Estonia's [[government_response_to_covid19 | government response to COVID-19]] was described as "responsive" and deeply "entrenched in Tech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. The approach was iterative, adapting to changing circumstances, akin to "crossing the river by feeling the stones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Key aspects included:
*   **Data Focus**: Recognizing a need for better data maturity, efforts were made to improve data flow, publication, and ensure decision-makers worked from reliable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Community Involvement**: A significant insight was the crucial role of community involvement, particularly the tech community and hackers, who proactively offered assistance, even freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. This led to rapid digital solutions, such as a hackathon that produced quick fixes for managing protective gear stock and public maps of the virus spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. Estonia's COVID tracing app was built with government collaboration but primarily by the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

### Montenegro: Mobilization and Digitalization
Montenegro's [[government_response_to_covid19 | government response to COVID-19]] involved mobilizing all policy departments to face the new reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. The strategy focused on:
*   **Societal Ownership**: Ensuring every sector of administration and society took ownership and participated in the response, emphasizing hand hygiene, mask use, and physical distancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
*   **Community Transmission Suppression**: Rapidly finding and isolating cases, providing care, and supporting contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Flattening the Curve**: The overall objective was to reduce the pace of the virus to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   **Continuity of Public Services**: Adjusting public administration to non-physical contact measures, ensuring services to citizens through rethinking working patterns and communication methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
*   **Digitalization and e-Services**: Providing information on national portals, mobile applications, and social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Rapid adjustments were made to internal ICT procedures and legal frameworks to support new working methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Software developers were mobilized to design new apps and services, and secure communication channels were provided for remote work for public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Areas for Improvement

### Challenges Faced
*   **Data Integrity and Literacy**: Estonia initially struggled with data issues, highlighting a need for better data maturity and ensuring decision-makers work from reliable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Strategy and Policy Gaps**: Montenegro noted the absence of a pre-defined strategy or policy paper for similar situations, which led to a fragmented [[challenges_and_responses_during_the_covid19_pandemic | crisis response]] instead of a coordinated multi-sectoral effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   **Social and Economic Impact Analysis**: A lack of relevant social and impact analysis on children and adults, including quantitative forecasts on economic and financial stability, was identified in Montenegro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.
*   **Procurement Process**: Montenegro's public procurement process proved too long and inadequate for the rapid response needed during the pandemic, underscoring the need for e-procurement procedures, especially for urgent situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

### Unexpected Insights
*   **Youth Adaptability**: The UAE found that children and the younger generation adapted most seamlessly to remote schooling and new ways of living, demonstrating resilience and technological adaptability that governments can learn from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   **Community Readiness**: Estonia was surprised by the willingness of the tech community and hackers to offer help, highlighting that the challenge was government readiness to work with them, rather than a lack of resources from the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
*   **Domestic Production Capabilities**: Indonesia's discovery of its own capacity to produce PPE, even for international aid, after initial reliance on imports, was an unexpected benefit of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.

### The "New Normal" and Future Governance

Many governments anticipate that some changes enacted during the pandemic will become permanent aspects of the "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

*   **Remote Work and Productivity**: Remote work is expected to be a lasting trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. However, a key challenge is cracking how to effectively measure staff productivity in remote settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. The shift challenges the traditional view that productivity is contingent on set hours within an office environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation and e-Services**:
    *   **UAE**: Heavy prior investment in Digital Services allowed for a smooth migration to online service provision during lockdown, with usage increasing significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. The UAE plans to shut down 50% of its physical customer care centers within two years to further accelerate digital service adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.
    *   **Montenegro**: Expects governmental agencies to decrease or abolish direct in-person contact, fully transitioning to electronic communication and service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.
    *   **Indonesia**: Developed a new normal strategy with five steps: preconditioning, priority, timing, coordination between central and local governments, and monitoring/evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. Local leaders manage openings for industries, schools, businesses, and tourism, requiring preparation of health infrastructure and simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. A dashboard monitors not only cases but also public behavior (e.g., mask-wearing, physical distancing) through thousands of volunteers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.
*   **Agility in Governance**:
    *   **UAE**: Hopes that the "fast track" approach used for urgent, high-priority issues during the crisis will become a structured framework, aiming to institutionalize an agile framework for policy-making and regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.
    *   **Estonia**: Expressed hope that the experience of going digital overnight will demonstrate that rapid action "can be done," encouraging less discussion and more action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.
    *   **Montenegro**: Believes the crisis should accelerate changes that foster collaboration, flexibility, inclusion, and accountability within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **Investment in Prevention and Preparedness**: The experience reinforced the importance of proactive anticipation and investing in key areas before a crisis hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
    *   **UAE**: Continued to invest in ambitious projects like space missions (probe to Mars, mission to the Moon by 2024) even during the pandemic, based on the belief that early investments yield future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. They also launched a digital school platform for refugees, recognizing the risk of increased digital divide in education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.
    *   **Indonesia**: Is investing in improving its health systems as part of the Global Health Security Agenda, focusing on capacity to detect, prevent, and respond to emerging infectious diseases. This includes expanding its laboratory network for detection and supporting drug and vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.

### Institutionalizing Change and Foresight
There is a consensus that these positive changes will not last unless consciously worked upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. The pandemic, while devastating, has provided invaluable knowledge to pass on to future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.
*   **Post-COVID Committees**: The UAE established a team in March to develop a post-COVID strategy, focusing on opportunities across different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. Indonesia also has a committee with two task forces: one for COVID-19 control and another for National Recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. Montenegro's National Coordination Body makes future plans, though activities were delayed due to a change in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>. Estonia is working to build foresight capabilities within its teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.
*   **Remembering**: The idea of "remembering" the lessons learned from the pandemic is crucial to ensure resilience for future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Role of Government**: Most panelists anticipated an increased role for government post-COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

The collective experience highlights that the pandemic has acted as a "tailwind," pushing public administrations towards modernization and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.

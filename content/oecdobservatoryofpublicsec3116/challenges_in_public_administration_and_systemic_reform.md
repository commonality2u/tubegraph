The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated dramatic transformations in the public sector, raising questions about the sustainability of these changes beyond the immediate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A key poll question posed to participants in one session of the OECD's Government Aftershock initiative asked whether the pandemic would lead to a return to "business as usual" or induce sustainable, resourced, and long-standing innovations in governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Initial results showed strong optimism for enduring change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, though this was later tempered to about two-thirds believing in sustainable change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Drivers for Change in Public Administration

The OECD's Innovative Responses Tracker captured over 430 innovative responses to the pandemic across various policy areas, functions, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Many of these, such as widespread remote working, telehealth, [[public administration transformation | de-siloing the state]], increased collaboration, greater stakeholder engagement, raised risk tolerance, reduced administrative burden, and fostering entrepreneurial public servants, had been called for by practitioners and academics for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

The crisis provided a "burning platform" that pushed these [[public administration transformation | transformations]] over the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, enabling:
*   **Entrepreneurial Mindset:** Bureaucrats questioned established habits rather than solely adhering to laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
*   **Cultural Shift:** Aversion to risk decreased, and employees felt a greater sense of purpose, receiving clear directions and autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Collaboration:** Silos were broken, replaced by rapid, dynamic, small-team decision-making and cross-agency and cross-national cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.
*   **Citizen Demand:** Citizens deeply understood the need for digital services like telehealth, becoming potential adopters of new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.
*   **Political Leadership:** Strong political leadership was crucial in providing the necessary impetus for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.
*   **Pre-existing Pilot Programs:** The pandemic released funding and broke down scaling barriers, allowing existing pilot programs in business processes and work practices to rapidly expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

## [[Challenges and opportunities in public administration | Challenges to Sustainable Reform]]

Despite the impetus for change, several [[public sector challenges and transformations | challenges]] persist in sustaining these innovations:
*   **Bandwidth and Priorities:** Public service organizations face numerous demands, making it difficult to maintain a consistent program of [[public administration reform | reform]] when constantly reacting to immediate issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Vested Interests:** [[public administration reform | Reform]] involves challenging existing practices, potentially affecting economic interests or making work more difficult for specific groups who may resist change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion and "Gotcha" Culture:** Public servants are often risk-averse due to public scrutiny, parliamentary committees, and inquiries that penalize mistakes, hindering experimentation and [[Challenges of government innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.
*   **Attention Span:** Sustaining interest and funding for long-term contingency planning is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.
*   **Societal Readiness:** Governments can only move so fast if society cannot follow. This includes addressing digital literacy and accessibility gaps, as seen with online education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Constraints:** High national debt and declining tax bases could lead to austerity measures, making it difficult to fund continued [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] and investment in government capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.

## Enduring Changes and [[Future challenges and opportunities in public administration | Future Priorities]]

Some changes are likely to persist as normal operating procedures:
*   **Remote/Blended Work:** The working place is no longer solely a building; a blended approach of remote and in-office work is likely to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. This also forces rethinking classified information handling, performance evaluation, and the essential nature of affordable childcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>.
*   **Digitalization and Data-Driven Decision Making:** A push for completely paperless processes, increased use of digital forms, and decision-making based on robust data will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>.
*   **Agility and Incremental Innovation:** The speed of reaction, agility, and step-by-step experimentation and [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] dynamics are expected to remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>.
*   **Collaboration and Consultation:** Increased collaboration within and between governments, and with society, is likely to be a permanent shift, moving towards more bottom-up solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **Health System Capacity:** Increased capacity in health systems, including testing and tracing infrastructure, will likely remain for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.
*   **Application of AI:** Implementation of chatbots and artificial intelligence for machine augmentation will likely persist to reduce service times and allow humans to transition to higher-value work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>.
*   **Focus on Social and Racial Justice:** A systematic appreciation and assessment of the impact of social and racial justice in government programs is gaining traction, particularly at local levels, driving structural adjustments for more equitable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

## Capacity Constraints and Areas for Improvement

Key capacity constraints and areas needing attention include:
*   **Public Trust in Government:** The level of citizen trust in government is crucial for driving change and sustaining a government that meets people's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **People and Skills:** Attracting and nurturing the next generation of [[leadership_and_teamwork_in_public_administration | leaders]] with the right skills and motivation is vital. The crisis has given public servants a sense of common purpose, potentially making public service a more attractive career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.
*   **Data Utilization:** Improving how data is used, linked, and leveraged to make better decisions and provide better services to citizens is a significant capacity issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>.
*   **Foresight vs. Risk Management:** While risk registers are common, more investment in foresight and scenario planning is needed to anticipate [[future_challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_administration | future challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

## Administrative Habits to Decommission

Several administrative habits should be abandoned to foster continuous [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] and adaptability:
*   **Inability to End Things:** The public sector must learn to deprioritize and stop initiatives that are no longer effective, rather than continuously starting new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.
*   **Outsourced Large IT Projects:** Multi-year, largely outsourced IT projects should be replaced with shorter-term deliverables that lead to greater success and better cost management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
*   **Excessive Risk Aversion:** A shift towards taking balanced, entrepreneurial risks is needed, requiring a cultural change within the civil service and in political and media discourse to move away from a "gotcha" culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>.
*   **Long Policy Cycles:** The slow pace of policy-making and adoption should be replaced with smart, incremental policies that speed up the legislative and policy creation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
*   **Lifetime Career Model:** Fostering a more permeable service model that allows movement between government and the private sector could introduce higher levels of risk tolerance and facilitate cross-sector [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>.

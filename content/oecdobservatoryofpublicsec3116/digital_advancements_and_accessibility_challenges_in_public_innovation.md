Innovation, in general, is difficult to define because it pertains to new things and novelty that did not previously exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Defining Innovation in the Public Sector

While innovation in the private sector focuses on new things implemented in a market context to gain a competitive advantage (be it a service, process, product, or new thinking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, defining [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_sector_innovation | innovation in the public sector]] is more complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This is due to the absence of the market's feedback system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

[[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_sector_innovation | Public sector innovation]] should be defined by novelty â€“ not just new things, but things new to the specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. These can include new thinking, services, or other concepts, but they must always be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This means that we are not talking about mere inventions or ideas, but rather applied new thinking, services, or processes that have had an actual [[impact_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Unlike the private sector, the public sector typically cannot talk about competitive advantage, as the government is often the sole provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Instead, the focus is on contributing to a change in public value through these new initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## The Dual Nature of Innovation's Impact

The [[impact_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | impact]] of innovation does not necessarily have to be positive; it can also be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For instance, innovation linked to [[digital_transformation_and_inclusion_in_public_services | digital advancements]] can enable quicker delivery of services to different people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

However, such advancements can also lead to a portion of the population being excluded from the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This exclusion can occur because they lack access to the necessary digital tools or do not possess the capabilities or capacity to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Therefore, innovation can yield both positive and negative outcomes, but it consistently involves new things implemented in a new context that bring some form of value to the population that uses them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

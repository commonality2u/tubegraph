European governance faces a complex and uncertain future, marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, an energy crisis, and high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This challenging environment highlights the critical need for a resilient public sector, which is considered the cornerstone in difficult situations for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Governments must become more proactive in tackling arising issues and shaping a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## The Role of Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG)

Recent events underscore that anticipatory innovation and foresight are essential elements of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Citizens turn to public administration when change happens and crises hit, necessitating preparedness and proactive planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG) involves creating knowledge about the future and making decisions based on that knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. It's about taking action today towards future outlooks, requiring an agency in governments to use tools, make sense of scenarios, explore alternatives, and translate insights into innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. An "authorizing environment" with feedback systems and evaluation is also needed to legitimize this work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

The European Commission, through its Directorate-General for Structural Reform Support, coordinates policy-making for the quality of public administration and supports member states in adopting AIG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The Commission provides financial and technical support, intellectual advice, and shares inspiring project examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## [[future_challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_administration | Future Challenges for European Administrations]]

European administrations face increasingly complex policy issues in a world of "super wicked problems" such as climate change and "black swan" events like COVID-19, compounded by complex multi-level governance and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Complexity can be managed with the right decision-making and cooperative systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

The European Commission has identified five key [[future_challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_administration | future challenges]] where anticipatory innovation capacity will be central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>:

1.  **Unprecedented Speed of Technological Change** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>: This requires adapting administrative working and decision-making methods, enabling human-centricity in public services, and rethinking, redesigning, and redeploying administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
2.  **Impact of Demographic Changes and Increasing Skills Shortage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>: New skills are necessary to address these challenges, develop solutions for reform and recovery packages, and maintain/improve administrative capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
3.  **Increasing Complexity of Managing Policy Issues** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>: Public administrations must encourage a culture of innovation as a central part of their functioning at all levels of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
4.  **Impact and Importance of the [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_green_governance | Green Transition]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>: To achieve the goal of a climate-neutral continent, administrations need leadership competence, a sound knowledge base, and accountability/transparency in policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
5.  **Increase in Competition for Limited Public Funding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>: Prioritization, leadership, innovative thinking, and improved financial management are key to addressing intergenerational fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. This requires better understanding of future [[challenges and opportunities in public administration | challenges and opportunities]], making a culture of innovation essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Finland's Leadership in AIG

Finland is undertaking one of the biggest public sector transformations, including the creation of welfare counties, representing a completely new level of public governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This, combined with numerous crises, makes their work challenging, requiring them to work harder, identify core issues, and be more proactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Finland intends to take concrete steps towards [[future_oriented_governance | proactive governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This transformation is a "marathon," not a "sprint," with an expected completion by the end of the 2020s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

The country has collaborated with the OECD to develop and assess an AIG model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. Key insights from Finland's work include the need to:
*   Increase civil servants' capacity to reflect on [[future_challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_administration | future policy challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   Create long-term planning for short-term democracies through revised policy-making and budgetary processes, and better dialogue between politicians and the public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   Integrate anticipatory innovation functions into existing government functions, such as strategy planning, budgetary decisions, legislation, and human resource management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
*   Develop new government functions, like a "government transition function," to ensure continuity of complex policies across government terms and prevent loss of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
*   Make government planning functions more transparent for analyzing emerging issues and assigning responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.

Finland's work serves as a blueprint for other member states to plan and adjust better to evolutions and be more prepared for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## Approaches in Other European Countries

Other European countries are also exploring and applying anticipatory innovation concepts:

### Norway
Norway sees similarities between its society and government and Finland's, aiming to strengthen a "Nordic model" of anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. Initiatives include:
*   Using scenario planning, horizon scanning, and foresight methods to create robust policies and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.
*   Assignments on information influence on elections, presenting scenarios to illustrate how influence can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>.
*   Developing public sector scenarios for 2040 to make innovation policies [[future_oriented_governance | future-fit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.
*   A "seamless services" program using foresight methods to ensure new services meet future user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
*   Focusing on developing future literacy and connected skills for public sector leaders and learning from international cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>.

### Portugal
Portugal has established PlanAPP, a new competence center at the core of government focused on planning, foresight, public policy monitoring, and evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. PlanAPP aims to cut across silos through networks like RIPLAN, providing a more holistic response to [[future_challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_administration | future challenges and opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.

Specific initiatives include:
*   Developing an anticipatory innovation starter kit for a network of innovative public administration entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.
*   Launching the "Ministries of the Future" initiative and the "Network of Foresight of the European Union" during its Council presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   Aiming to regain competencies and skills across the public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>.
*   The "2050 Lab" project, a participatory visioning project involving civil society and citizens to imagine Portugal's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.
*   A critical goal is to create a culture inside public administration that promotes and integrates foresight and innovation into daily practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

### Netherlands
The Netherlands, an open country with broad policy discussions, could integrate the AIG model well, though it's not yet doing so in a structured way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>. Challenges include:
*   Difficulty in translating innovations (e.g., AI, hyperloops, flying cars, data science) into policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.
*   Public servants' risk aversion, requiring a culture change to create room for innovation and dismantle unsustainable practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.
*   Funding is key to keeping topics on the agenda, especially for urgent projects, but innovation phases struggle with funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.

## Building Resilience and Trust

The primary challenge for public administrations is building resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Resilience is born from two elements:
1.  Stable and efficient processes and structures that deliver quality services and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
2.  A capacity for disruption that allows for challenging, innovating, adapting, and improving public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

Anticipatory innovation capacity and the structural courage to challenge the status quo are vital for democratic societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Citizen participation is crucial for anticipatory approaches, as it builds trust and resilience within both government and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>. The ability to innovate in government is directly linked to trust in government itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Anticipatory Innovation Governance is not an "extra layer" but an essential driver for public sector effectiveness and a part of the culture of modern public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>. It helps governments remain dynamic, explore possibilities, experiment, and continuously learn as part of a broader governance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>. Governments around the world are expected to upgrade their capacity to anticipate the future and act together to respond to [[challenges_of_global_governance_systems | global challenges]] through continuously identifying, testing, and implementing innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>.

There is ongoing work to connect anticipation to risk management across public and private ecosystems and link anticipation to recovery and resilience plans across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>. Anticipatory innovation approaches are critical for governments to integrate and deliver effectively in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>.

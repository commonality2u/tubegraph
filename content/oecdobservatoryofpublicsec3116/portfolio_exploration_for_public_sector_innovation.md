## Introduction to Portfolio Exploration
Portfolio exploration is a method and tool developed by the OECD Observatory of [[public sector innovation]] (OPSI) to help organizations understand, manage, and strategize their innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The approach aims to provide a clear picture of an organization's existing innovation portfolio and identify areas for development and strategic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

The OPSI team has been developing the Portfolio Exploration Tool for about a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It transforms theoretical concepts into a self-service virtual tool, allowing distributed analysis without OPSI's physical presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## Why Portfolio Approaches are Needed in the Public Sector
[[innovation portfolio management in the public sector]] is crucial because organizations, even unknowingly, have existing innovation portfolios comprising various projects and programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. These approaches are essential to effectively steward [[public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### OPSI Innovation Facets Model
The OPSI works with an "innovation facets model" to categorize different types of innovation based on their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. These facets are connected to specific questions or purposes the public sector aims to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The level of certainty influences how each type of innovation can be stewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

The four main types of [[types of innovation within public sector organizations]] are:
*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>: Driven by specific goals, often top-down, with high certainty regarding the desired outcomes. It aims to achieve agreed-upon results and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>: Focuses on improving existing systems to be more effective, efficient, or to reach more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. It has high levels of certainty and is often pushed by drivers like austerity, cost reduction, or increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>: Responds to new ideas and evolving situations from within the system. It cannot be steered top-down, requiring open space for creativity, experimentation, and exploration by employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>: Addresses new risks, uncertainties, and future developments, preparing for fundamental shifts and changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This area involves high uncertainty and may look at ideas critical to the organization's strategic aims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## The Portfolio Exploration Tool
The Portfolio Exploration Tool is designed to allow organizations to analyze their context, visualize their innovation portfolio, and identify areas for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.

> [!tip] Tool Purpose
> The tool helps organizations develop innovation capabilities, recommends actions based on results, and facilitates exploration of changes over time to intervene and shift their innovation portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

The tool offers:
*   **Self-service online tool** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>.
*   **Kit for hosting and running local portfolio exploration sessions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

Outputs from the tool include:
*   **Individually tailored results and guidance**: Helps understand organizational capabilities and strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:29">[01:32:29]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Management Capability Score**: Assesses the strength of factors important for managing an innovation portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
*   **Project-based mapping**: Visualizes where current projects and activities land within the innovation facets model, enabling "reverse engineering" conversations about desired future portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:33">[01:14:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.

The tool also provides guidance on combined results, such as when the organizational portfolio balance and support structures do not align with the project map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>.

### Levels of Analysis
The tool can be used for different levels of analysis:
*   **Individual**: To understand one's own portfolio or perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.
*   **Team**: To make a case for deeper portfolio analysis, see how a team fits into the organizational portfolio, and decide on its role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.
*   **Senior Management/Advisors**: To get a snapshot, build a strategy, or align efforts with ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>.

### Practical Applications
The tool aids in:
*   Gaining an understanding of where innovation is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   Opening conversations between projects to identify synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.
*   Allowing for "discourse by design," where anticipatory projects might question existing missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:22">[00:52:22]</a>.
*   Clarifying the definition of innovation within an organization, usually defined as "novel to context," "implemented," and having "impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.

> [!important] Note
> The tool is a starting point for discussions; it doesn't solve all innovation problems but forces long-overdue questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

## Case Studies
### Natural Resources Wales (NRW)
NRW, formed in 2013, operates under groundbreaking Welsh legislation that enshrines sustainable development and places a statutory duty on public bodies to consider future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. It is a large environmental sponsored body with over 1900 staff and a wide range of roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

**Challenges and Use of Portfolio Exploration:**
*   **Addressing major challenges**: NRW faces the climate emergency and nature crisis, which require innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   **Balancing responsibilities**: The organization must balance innovation with statutory responsibilities around regulation and enforcement, which often require a risk-averse approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.
*   **Crystallizing discussions**: The tool provided a framework to crystallize discussions and create a common language around innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   **Wider engagement**: It helped widen conversations about innovation beyond small groups of like-minded innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.
*   **Portfolio balance**: Initial results showed NRW is strong in the "enhancement" space, due to its highly specialized staff, but needs to be stronger in the "anticipatory" space to address radical challenges like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.
*   **Innovation fund experience**: An internal innovation fund, initially loose for experimentation, became rigid due to demands for transparency. The tool highlighted why projects with a stronger "innovation core" often failed to progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>. It showed how the organization thinks about [[public sector innovation]] and managing projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>.
*   **Portfolio management capability**: NRW has a small interdisciplinary team providing central coordination, focusing on culture, capability, and capacity (the "three C's") for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.
*   **Defining innovation**: A challenge remains in getting everyone on the same page about what counts as innovation and what should be included in the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

### City of Lund, Sweden
Lund is a university city with a history of innovation (e.g., Bluetooth) and is home to major research facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. The city operates an innovation platform, a governmental initiative to push [[innovation in the public sector]] down to the city level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

**Challenges and Use of Portfolio Exploration:**
*   **"Super storm" of innovation**: Lund faces a rapid influx of innovation that impacts the city, requiring new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   **Awareness and collaboration**: Key challenges include creating awareness of innovation's potential within the city and fostering collaboration with external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   **Structuring efforts**: Portfolio thinking helps structure thoughts, combine with other models (like multi-stakeholder governance), and avoid random innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
*   **Political context**: In a political context, the city needs to balance mandates with practical delivery and proper tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.
*   **Portfolio balance**: The tool revealed that "enhancement" and "anticipatory" areas were often not explicitly considered "innovations" and lacked dedicated resources, despite being significant areas of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. Mission-oriented goals receive more attention but lack proper follow-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
*   **Portfolio management capability**: For Lund, [[innovation portfolio management in public sector]] is less about process management and more about a "people-relational system." It requires a neutral facilitator who can negotiate between different areas and external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>. This work takes time (e.g., three years for an electric charging project) and requires patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. A key approach is to be "strength-based," focusing on positive aspects and successes, giving credit to all projects and avoiding problem-centric language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.

## Portfolio Balance and Management Capability
### Portfolio Balance
Portfolio balance does not mean having an equal number of projects or funding across all innovation types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. Instead, it should be meaningful to the organization's specific aims and purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. For example:
*   A caregiving or welfare organization might have a portfolio heavily weighted towards adaptive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.
*   Organizations like NASA or the European Space Agency would have a highly anticipatory and mission-oriented portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.

The key is to connect strategic aims to the innovation portfolio and avoid "lock-ins" that prevent exploring different types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>. An unbalanced portfolio can be appropriate if it aligns with strategic goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

### Portfolio Management Capability
Effective [[innovation portfolio management in public sector]] requires:
*   **Clear Assignment of Responsibility**: Someone must be assigned to steward the portfolio, collect information, make sense of it, and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>. This needs to be an ongoing activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.
*   **Supportive Structures**: Structures must allow different types of innovation to coexist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Resource Allocation and Monitoring**: How different types of innovation are resourced, monitored, and evaluated across the entire portfolio (not just single projects) is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Learning and Communication**: Managing learning and communication within and about the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Tolerance for Failure**: Single innovations can fail, but the portfolio as a whole should succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. A 100% success rate indicates insufficient risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.
*   **Strategic Alignment**: Portfolio management capabilities should connect to the organization's strategic intent and goals, whether at a city, ministry, team, or specific mission level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.
*   **Cross-cutting Issues**: For wicked issues like climate change, portfolio management needs to consider how different units' portfolios interact and fit together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.
*   **External Partnerships**: The ability to analyze meeting points and motivations with private sector, NGO, and network partners is a crucial skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.

> [!info] The Power of Conversation
> The tool's primary benefit is fostering conversations about portfolios and portfolio balance that might otherwise be long overdue, helping organizations define a starting point for discussions, strategies, and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Get Involved
The OPSI Portfolio Exploration Tool will be launched at the "Government Aftershock" event in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. This event program aims to bring together conversations about the impact of major shocks on government and how to integrate hard-won lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>.

Organizations can sign up to host their own self-organized strategy sessions leading up to the main event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:36">[01:21:36]</a>. These sessions should be planned for two hours, with an additional 30-45 minutes for individual self-assessment using the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:45">[01:22:45]</a>. The kit provides a facilitation plan and communication plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>. The aim is to discuss three key questions:
1.  What do we need to leave behind? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>
2.  What do we want to keep? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>
3.  What should we do differently? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>

Participants in these sessions will be able to share their experiences with the tool and provide feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>. The aggregate results from these sessions will contribute to a continuously updated global picture of [[public sector innovation_strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>.

This article explores the challenges and practicalities of public sector organizations adopting [[mission_oriented_innovation_strategies_and_practices | Mission-Oriented Innovation]] approaches. It draws insights from a webinar jointly hosted by the OECD Observatory of [[Public Sector Innovation | Public Sector Innovation]], the OECD Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation, and the OECD Development Cooperation Directorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The primary goal is to discuss insights on the practical implementation and long-term governance of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Defining Mission-Oriented Innovation Policy

The OECD defines [[mission_oriented_innovation_strategies_and_practices | Mission-Oriented Innovation Policy]] as a coordinated package of policy and regulatory measures tailored to mobilize science, technology, and innovation to address societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This package:
*   Spans several stages of the innovation cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   Uses different policy instruments, from supply-side to demand-side, including regulatory measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   Crosses different policy fields, sectors, and disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Is targeted toward ambitious, bold, and concrete measurable goals to be met within a defined timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Dimensions and Challenges of Mission Orientation

Mission orientation involves three main dimensions, each presenting specific challenges:

### Strategic Orientation
The core challenge is creating broad consensus on selected societal challenges and translating them into clear, bold objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Key questions include:
*   How to customize missions for specific situations, considering scope, depth, granularity, focus, and boldness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   How to secure and balance the involvement of diverse stakeholders (politicians, experts, policymakers), and manage the risk of mission inflation or dilution due to broad participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   How to engage beyond traditional stakeholders, including citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Policy Coordination
This dimension focuses on coordinating public and private actors across disciplinary, sectoral, and policy silos towards shared mission achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Challenges involve:
*   Engaging policy bodies beyond the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) area, including sectoral ministries and regulatory bodies, to address complex societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   Coordinating actors across different levels of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   Setting up effective governance structures, which can be complex (e.g., the mission-driven top sectors governance structure in the Netherlands) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Policy Implementation
The ultimate test of a mission-oriented approach is its practical implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Key questions include:
*   How to connect supply-side and demand-side instruments effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   How to manage solution portfolios, ensuring they remain solution-neutral while addressing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   How to monitor and evaluate these systemic policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. An example of bringing together agency portfolios to cover the innovation chain is Norway's Pilot-E scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## The Bright Side of Missions
Despite the challenges, [[mission_oriented_innovation_in_public_administration | mission-oriented innovation]] policies offer a dedicated and tailor-made space for collective action, adaptable to each area and institutional setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. They facilitate:
*   Co-creation of objectives and targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   Establishment of specific governance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   Design and implementation of an intentional policy mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

This systemic approach can be developed gradually through experimentation and learning, avoiding the need for an "all at once" implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## The Mission Action Lab
The OECD is establishing a "Missions Action Lab" to support countries in operationalizing missions and addressing practical challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. The lab aims to select 3-4 demonstration cases across different mission areas, types, and countries starting in late 2021 or 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. It will also foster a community for knowledge sharing and learning from diverse experiences, including those in low and middle-income countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.

## Missions in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)

Countries, regardless of income level, share important characteristics in addressing complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Missions can be separated by the type of challenge they address (complicated vs. complex) and their scale (global vs. national/city-level) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

The involvement of bilateral development providers, multilateral institutions (including international financial institutions), and national governments adds significant complexity to [[Public Sector Innovation | public sector innovation]] in LMICs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

### Specific Challenges in LMICs:

#### Strategic Orientation
*   **Localization and Ownership:** Ensuring the mission is localized and genuinely owned by national actors (government, civil society), rather than being externally driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Capacity Reflection:** Missions must reflect the capabilities and capacities of the national [[Public sector innovation fundamentals | innovation]] ecosystem, often requiring integral technology transfer models, which is a key differentiator from high-income countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

#### Policy Coordination
*   **Fit-for-Purpose Mechanisms:** Determining if existing International Development coordination mechanisms (e.g., UN system, poverty reduction strategies, humanitarian clusters) or national government coordination systems are suitable for advancing cross-sectoral work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Mimicry:** Preventing superficial adoption of approaches ("morphic mimicry") without undergoing necessary deep institutional transformations and coordination process changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

#### Policy Implementation
*   **Projectification:** The tendency for development work to be project-based, which accentuates challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Commitment:** Securing sustained commitment from international and multilateral actors, who may shift priorities based on "development fads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Bottleneck of Single Implementation:** Overcoming the established practice of pursuing a single implementation pathway, which contrasts with the mission-oriented premise of investing in competing solutions to drive systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

Emerging good practices in LMICs include the Family Planning 2030 Mission and place-based missions for circular economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

## Practitioner Perspectives on Implementation Challenges

### CSIRO, Australia
CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, operates on a "science for impact" model, focusing on applied research and development. Unlike some European models, it doesn't have a central pool of government funding for missions but aims to "crowd in" existing financial and other resources from industry, government, research, and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. CSIRO has identified 12 mission candidates, with 4 formally launched (Hydrogen Industry, Future Protein, Trusted Agri-foods, Drought Resilience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

*   **Biggest Challenge:** Scaling up. Despite extensive preparation, mission leads struggle with a lack of clear signposts beyond impact pathways and program logic. Questions arise about incentives, ongoing monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and determining intervention points if programs deviate from objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>.
*   **Role in Intervention:** CSIRO's central "missions program office" acts as a gatekeeper, given a mandate by the CEO and board to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. With missions aspiring to drive one-third of external revenue, distinguishing between mission-aligned activities and other valuable research (e.g., spin-out companies, normal research discovery) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>.

### Research Council of Norway (RCN)
Norway's Pilot-E scheme, an inter-agency initiative developed bottom-up by entrepreneurial individuals, links existing tools across agencies to achieve better results, such as developing electric ferries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

*   **Scaling Up:** The scheme has scaled up to new areas like healthcare, adapting to different actors (municipalities, hospitals) with distinct incentives and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
*   **Leveling Up:** A major shift involves moving towards a "whole-of-government" approach for industrial transformation (e.g., reducing oil and gas dependency), aiming for a broad political agreement within a new long-term plan for research and higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.
*   **Biggest Challenge:** Scaling up from successful, informal, bottom-up initiatives to larger, more formal levels often introduces cultural and legal issues (e.g., publicizing applicant lists), and increased political involvement can bring "prestige issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. Connecting national missions with European or global missions is also important for maximum impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.

### UNDP Vietnam
The UNDP in Vietnam employs "deep demonstrations" and portfolio sense-making to address complex socio-environmental challenges like plastic waste and the transition to a circular economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. Their approach involves an iterative process of learning and extracting insights from current projects to identify acceleration opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.

*   **Biggest Challenge:** Creating a movement and necessary buy-in from local actors. In Da Nang, despite existing policies on circular economy, implementation was lacking. Designing interventions requires understanding underlying drivers and dynamics, rather than just organizational positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>. A key issue is bridging silos and incentives across different government departments and ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Management:** The UNDP uses a "studio approach" to reframe challenges, bringing together diverse backgrounds (architects, journalists, economists, biologists) to understand various angles of the problem space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. Key learnings included recognizing circular economy as an economic and resilience-building emergency, requiring cross-ministerial interventions beyond environmental ministries, and managing risks for future-proofing Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>. The portfolio must be adaptable to unexpected learnings and allow for pivoting, which current development mechanisms often hinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

### Innovation Fund Denmark
The Innovation Fund Denmark is implementing Denmark's first true mission-driven program with significant funding for green research (PTX, carbon capture, agriculture/food, circular economy, plastic/textiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>. They have asked stakeholders to define roadmaps and are now selecting between them for partnership calls, operating under a tight one-year timeframe for program development and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.

*   **Biggest Challenge:** Measuring impact of different roadmaps, especially when comparing diverse goals like greenhouse gas reduction and competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. There is a conflict between staying focused on the roadmap and maintaining agility to adapt to changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. Incentivizing new companies and researchers to join, and establishing methods (legal and cultural) to stop underperforming projects, are also critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>. Finally, ensuring industry involvement beyond public funding and integrating demand-side policies (consumer behavior, regulation) is crucial to avoid technology-only solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.

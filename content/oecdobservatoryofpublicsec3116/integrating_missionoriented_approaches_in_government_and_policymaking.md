This article explores the concept of [[missionoriented_innovation_in_public_policy | mission-oriented innovation]] and its integration into government and policymaking, drawing insights from experts and practitioners around the world. The approach focuses on tackling complex societal challenges by setting ambitious, time-bound goals that require cross-sectoral collaboration and a shift from traditional market-fixing to market-shaping frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.

## Introduction to Mission-Oriented Innovation

[[missionoriented_innovation_in_public_policy | Mission-oriented innovation]] is defined as a coordinated package of research and innovation policy measures designed to address societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>. These policies span multiple stages of the innovation cycle, from upstream research to market launch, and utilize various instruments, including both supply-side and demand-side approaches, as well as top-down and bottom-up strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>. They cut across different policy fields, disciplines, and sectors, all while being targeted towards clear, ambitious, and concrete goals within a defined timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.

This approach is crucial for addressing urgent and complex challenges faced by the public sector and societies today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It emphasizes the need for a new framework where public and private entities actively co-create and shape markets, rather than merely fixing market failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### Key Principles

At the core of [[missionoriented_innovation_in_public_policy | mission-oriented innovation]] are several principles:
*   **Market Shaping and Co-creation:** Governments should not just fix markets but actively shape and co-create them, with purpose at the center of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This means going beyond simply filling gaps in areas where the private sector doesn't invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   **Risk Sharing and Rewards:** Instead of de-risking for private entities, policymakers should share risks and welcome uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. This naturally leads to questions about how rewards are also shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
*   **Directionality of Growth:** Economic growth should have a clear direction, moving towards specific goals like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Outcomes-Oriented Approach:** Policies should be designed with ambitious, outcomes-oriented strategies, nested within local contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Cross-Disciplinary and Cross-Actor Collaboration:** Missions require diverse involvement from public, private, and third sectors, as well as contributions from various disciplines, including humanities and social sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.
*   **Bottom-Up Experimentation:** While setting a clear direction, the approach must also enable and foster multiple bottom-up solutions and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

## Historical Context and Inspiration

The concept draws inspiration from ambitious past missions, such as the moon landing. While primarily technological, the moon landing demonstrated how diverse sectors (aeronautics, materials, electronics, software) could innovate and invest together, with public procurement policies designed to crowd in various efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

Modern [[mission_oriented_innovation_in_public_sector | missions in the public sector]] aim to apply this bold, ambitious, and outcomes-oriented strategy to global challenges like the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their 169 targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

## Challenges in Implementation

Implementing [[missionoriented_innovation_in_public_policy | mission-oriented innovation]] in government and policymaking faces several significant [[challenges_in_implementing_missiondriven_approaches | challenges]]:

*   **Silos and Anti-Collaboration Incentives:** Government structures often incentivize maintaining silos rather than breaking them down and collaborating across departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>. Procurement processes and HR structures can be "anti-collaboration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Placement of Missions:** Missions are often siloed within specific ministries (e.g., environment or innovation) instead of being central to economic growth and broader policy discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.
*   **Growth Models and Metrics:** Traditional economic growth models and metrics do not adequately account for the directionality of growth or the dynamic spillovers from [[mission_oriented_innovation_in_public_sector | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion:** Public agencies often face disincentives for risk-taking, unlike venture capitalists who can boast of failures leading to big successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>. There is a need to build an organizational culture and capability that embraces learning from trial and error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>.
*   **Defining Clear Missions:** While the ideal mission is bold, inspirational, clear, directed, and cross-disciplinary, many initiatives are often "mission washing" or lack specific targets and timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
*   **Technological vs. Societal Solutions:** Most [[missionoriented_innovation_in_public_policy | mission-oriented policies]] tend to focus on scientific and technological solutions, less so on solutions requiring changes in consumption or production behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.
*   [[challenges_in_coordinating_stakeholders_in_mission_oriented_policies | Stakeholder Coordination and Power Dynamics]]: Overarching frameworks risk dilution of missions and high transaction costs due to the need to enlist many stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. Cross-ministerial and cross-agency governance structures, while valuable, can still harbor strong tensions and power conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.
*   **Evaluation and Scale-Up:** Current evaluation tools for [[missionoriented_innovation_in_public_policy | mission-oriented policy]] are largely traditional, hindering the ability to capture dynamic spillovers and learn effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. Most initiatives remain pilots, with challenges in scaling up and diffusing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy and Administrative Instruments:** Overcoming existing bureaucratic structures and administrative instruments is a significant hurdle to implementing mission-driven change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>.

## Practical Examples and Approaches

### European Commission and Beyond

The European Commission has placed missions at the core of its ambitious €100 billion proposal for [[integration_of_national_climate_targets_with_missionoriented_approaches | mission-oriented research and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This includes focusing on grand challenges like climate change, aiming for carbon neutrality, which requires innovation across diverse sectors such as renewable energy, real estate, construction, mobility, and social sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

### The UK Government and Industrial Strategy

The UK government's industrial strategy shifted from a list of sectors to addressing key challenges, leading to the establishment of a [[mission_oriented_innovation_in_public_sector | mission-oriented]] commission. An example is transforming "future mobility" into a mission for "universally accessible travel," which spurred bottom-up innovation, particularly in accessibility for disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

### Local Level Engagement

*   **Camden Council (London, UK):** Worked on a carbon neutrality mission for 250 social housing estates, involving citizens directly in the process and developing metrics they could monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **Barcelona (Spain):** The mayor brought hackers into city government to proactively govern data for public purpose, such as public transport, reducing reliance on big tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Mondragón Region (Spain):** Leveraging a history of cooperative models, local government is working with workers, capital, government, and academics to drive regional transitions through a stakeholder value approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

### Public Finance and Conditionality

*   **Scottish National Investment Bank:** Designed as a goal-oriented public bank, it aims to put conditionalities on loans to ensure recipients help steer areas towards specific missions, inspired by successful models like KfW in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.
*   **European Investment Bank (EIB):** Research has explored how to transform EIB's loan generation system to truly function as a climate bank and support the circular economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.
*   **COVID-19 Recovery Schemes:** Globally, significant recovery funds (e.g., EU, US, Japan) are an opportunity to embed public value and conditionalities (e.g., lowering carbon emissions for companies receiving aid in France, or no tax havens in Denmark) directly into contracts to ensure alignment with public goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.

### Case Studies in Practice

*   **Sweden (Vinnova):**
    *   **"The Street" Mission:** This initiative repurposed existing streets, traditionally managed by traffic departments, to foster biodiversity, social life, and commerce, using them as "innovation environments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>. Prototypes, designed with input from local communities, including school children, were built to scale, providing a rationale for wider investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>. The project demonstrated a multi-faceted value model beyond just traffic management, showing how simple interventions can unlock complex systemic benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>.
    *   **School Food Mission:** This aimed to transform the existing public meal system (2 million meals/day in Sweden) from a focus on cost and hygiene to sustainability and health, encouraging regenerative agriculture and new business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>. This involved extensive co-creation with 300-400 organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>.
    *   **Lessons:** Emphasizes direction-led yet participatory design, place-based innovation to unlock [[systems_thinking_in_policymaking | systemic]] approaches, leveraging existing investments, and continuous engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>. Small islands of coherence can change the whole system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>.

*   **Spain (ENISA - National Innovation Agency):**
    *   **Focus:** ENISA, with 20 years of experience financing innovative SMEs and startups, focuses on industrial and business perspectives rather than solely basic R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>.
    *   **Four Pilots/Missions:** Sustainable Mobility, Universal Access to Housing (new construction), Secure Health (self-care and care for others), and Rural Agri-food Activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:46">[01:25:46]</a>.
    *   **Approach:** Emphasizes empowering entrepreneurs and innovative SMEs, a bottom-up discovery process, and strengthening local entrepreneurship ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>. Missions are broken down into challenges, with multiple solutions identified, and then transformed into Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>.

*   **Netherlands (Health Holland):**
    *   **Central Mission:** Focused on "living longer in good health for Dutch citizens" and "decreasing health inequalities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:49">[01:40:49]</a>.
    *   **Quadruple Helix Model:** Builds on a strong triple helix (researchers, entrepreneurs, government) but explicitly includes citizens as a fourth helix in the entire innovation chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.
    *   **Co-creation and Field Labs:** Facilitates connections between stakeholders by working directly with people who have a sense of urgency, especially at the local level. They swap the traditional approach by making local initiatives that meet needs the starting point for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:45">[01:44:45]</a>.
    *   **Tom de Luze Example:** A healthcare organization for people with dementia invited the whole village to co-create solutions, resulting in a community where residents have freedom enabled by technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:10">[01:45:10]</a>.

*   **UK (Royal Academy of Engineering - Engineering X):**
    *   **Role:** An academy leveraging its global engineering networks to tackle complex, global grand challenges. It focuses on taking existing knowledge and practices and diffusing them to where they are most needed, as well as targeted research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:06">[01:51:06]</a>.
    *   **Mission Example: Safer End of Engineered Life:** Addresses the safe disposal and decommissioning of engineered artifacts (e.g., medical devices, ships), particularly where risks are outsourced to less capable regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:35">[01:53:35]</a>.
    *   **Approach:** Used a global workshop to "put the system in a room," bringing together diverse stakeholders (workers' rights advocates, regulators, industry, academics) to build collective intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:17">[01:59:17]</a>. Emphasizes the importance of leveraging "networks of networks" and being open and exploratory in engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:31">[01:59:31]</a>.
    *   **Lessons:** The mission framework is highly useful for navigating uncertainty and encouraging experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:23">[02:02:23]</a>. It's crucial not to define programs or solutions too early, to be inclusive of underrepresented voices to avoid unintended consequences, and to prioritize collaboration over duplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:09">[02:03:09]</a>. Ultimately, success depends on fostering trusted personal relationships and mutual understanding among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:44">[02:04:44]</a>.

## Tools and Methodologies

A common thread in implementing [[missionoriented_approaches_and_cocreation | mission-oriented approaches and co-creation]] is the need for context-aware methodologies. This involves:

*   **System Mapping:** Engaging diverse stakeholders to collectively build system maps to understand complex interdependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.
*   **Engagement Frameworks:** Using frameworks that invite participation from the start, enabling [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | inclusive policymaking and community engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. This includes bringing citizens, companies, and government agencies together in workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.
*   **Prototyping:** Developing tangible prototypes on the ground to gather evidence, build political capital, and demonstrate the potential for scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Metrics and Evaluation:** Moving beyond traditional cost-benefit analysis to more dynamic metrics that capture spillovers and reflect the broader impact of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Implementation:** Allowing for flexibility and adaptation throughout the mission lifecycle, learning from failures, and continuously building on successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>.
*   **Platform Strategy:** Aligning the entire system around prototypes and mission goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:44">[01:22:44]</a>.

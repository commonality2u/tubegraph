Climate councils are independent advisory bodies established to guide governments and parliaments on their [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. They play a crucial role in strengthening [[mission_governance_in_climate_policy | climate governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> and are part of networks like the International Climate Council's Network (ICCN), which comprises councils globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

## Key Functions of Climate Councils

Climate councils provide vital functions in advancing climate action:

*   **Scientific Advice** Their primary role is to interpret [[role_of_foresight_in_addressing_climate_change_and_biodiversity | climate science]] and offer advice to government officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. They help bridge the gap between scientific findings and policy implementation, particularly in [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_implementing_missionoriented_climate_strategies | harder-to-abate sectors]] like agriculture and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Progress Assessment and Forward-Looking Advice** Councils assess progress against national targets and provide advice on how to stay on track for long-term climate goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. This includes advising on policies and sectoral pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>.
*   **Promoting Consistency and Neutrality** Due to short election cycles, government policy can fluctuate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Climate councils help ensure policy consistency across long-time horizons, remaining politically neutral and rooted in evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Fostering Societal Engagement** Climate councils can spur public participation and support for climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. Examples include deliberative dialogues with sectors like agriculture in Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>, citizen panels in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>, and broad stakeholder engagement on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.

## Challenges Faced by Climate Councils

Despite their importance, climate councils encounter several challenges:

*   **Politicization of Climate Change** Climate change is increasingly politicized, often painted as a left-wing issue rather than one based on scientific evidence, making decarbonization progress harder globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Councils often need to protect their independence amidst changing political tides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Weak Governance Structures** Inadequate channels within government can hinder the integration of climate policy with science and public engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Slow Policy Adoption** The pace of climate policy adoption and strengthening has slowed, reducing from 10% annually to 1-2% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Resource Strain and Shifting Priorities** Global growth slowdown, geopolitical tensions, and rising public debt strain government budgets, diverting attention from climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Government priorities can shift with changes in administration, leading to pushback from some sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Bureaucratic Inefficiencies** Despite high-level political support, bureaucratic processes can impede the implementation of climate policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.
*   **Disconnection in Policy Implementation** Climate policy at the national level may contradict provincial and local policies, leading to a lack of clear vision and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Mobilizing Private Investment** Crowding in resources from external actors, particularly private investment, remains a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>.

## Leveraging Mission Governance for Climate Action

Climate councils can significantly enhance their impact by embracing [[mission_governance_in_climate_policy | mission governance]] principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This approach establishes clear, measurable, and time-bound objectives, anchoring [[integration_of_national_climate_targets_with_missionoriented_approaches | climate commitments]] within strategic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

### Key Aspects of Mission Governance for Councils:

*   **Anchoring Mandates in Government**
    *   [[role_of_government_in_environmental_threats | Governments]] play a pivotal role in achieving global climate targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. Mission governance requires clear mandates and formalized responsibilities for high-level bodies responsible for climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.
    *   This involves anchoring missions in central government bodies, such as a cabinet committee on climate change chaired by the Prime Minister (e.g., UK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a> or a presidential commission (e.g., South Africa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. Such high-level anchoring ensures unified action and accountability across government departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
    *   Climate councils can serve as anchors or advise central government bodies and ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
*   **Fostering Cross-Sectoral Coordination**
    *   [[crosssectoral_and_interdisciplinary_collaboration_for_climate_policy | Mission governance]] promotes alignment of policies and actions across ministries and public agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
    *   This "whole-of-government" approach is essential as climate change is an economy-wide issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. It counteracts the perception that climate policy is solely the responsibility of environmental departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
    *   Councils can facilitate horizontal coordination at the national level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a> and vertical alignment with subnational bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.
*   **Building Capabilities and Evidence-Based Decisions**
    *   Mission governance emphasizes strengthening capabilities of public officials and institutions, requiring technical expertise and adaptive policymaking skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
    *   It supports evidence-based decision-making by integrating robust data and continuous learning, explicitly embedding evaluation, experimentation, and iterative learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This ensures policies remain responsive to changing circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **Enhancing Stakeholder Engagement**
    *   Mission governance fosters stronger stakeholder engagement, promoting transparency and equity in climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. This includes businesses, civil society, local communities, and citizens, ensuring policy decisions reflect broad societal interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
    *   Public consultation, if underdone, can lead to backlash and negative impacts on vulnerable communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
*   **Targeted Missions and Policy Mixes**
    *   Instead of broad goals, mission governance advocates for very specific missions below overall targets, such as "all feed from farmed fisheries shall come from sustainable sources" (Norway) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.
    *   These require access to a comprehensive policy mix, including legal frameworks, market-creating instruments, and skills development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.
*   **Innovation and Experimentation**
    *   [[Demand Side Policies in Climate Change | Innovation]] is a key driver for net zero, particularly for technologies not yet commercially available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
    *   However, current innovation efforts often focus on incremental improvements rather than R&D for entirely new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
    *   Mission-oriented approaches, particularly in [[climate and environmental missions in the European Union | STI (Science, Technology, and Innovation)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>, can foster ambitious cross-sectoral collaboration to scale and deploy solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Experimentation, though crucial, is often a lagging area in climate mitigation plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>.

### Examples of Climate Councils in Practice

*   **South Africa's Presidential Climate Commission**: Chaired by the President, it adopts a mission-based approach to overcome fragmentation and ensure broad alignment across government departments and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. This central anchoring allows for a more systematic and cross-sectoral approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>.
*   **Ireland's Climate Change Advisory Council**: Works within a legal framework that provides clear objectives for climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>.
*   **Denmark's InnoMissions**: Managed by the Innovation Fund Denmark, these are research and innovation partnerships in specific green areas (e.g., carbon capture, green fuels, eco-friendly agriculture, circular economy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. They gather ecosystem actors to develop and implement roadmaps, though the direct link to overall government strategy can be a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.
*   **UK's Climate Change Committee**: Acts as an independent advisor on targets, pathways, and progress towards net zero missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **New Zealand Climate Change Commission**: Has prioritized improving stakeholder engagement to enable greater societal contributions to achieving net-zero emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

## Findings from the Report "Harnessing Mission Governance to Achieve National Climate Targets"

The report, based on an analysis of climate mitigation reports from 15 countries and interviews with climate council members, highlights that while many countries have integrated net-zero emission targets into their frameworks, the current pace of action is insufficient to meet Paris Agreement commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

It identifies that:

*   **Framework Anchoring**: Most climate mitigation frameworks provide a good basis for problem anchoring and roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.
*   **Policy Mixes**: Countries often have access to broad policy mixes to address climate goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.
*   **Weaknesses**: Significant gaps exist in private investment, experimentation, mobilization of communities and private sector actors, and strong coordination and process integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.

The report strongly advocates for integrating [[mission_governance_in_climate_policy | mission governance]] principles into national climate efforts to make them more systematic and concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. This includes developing targeted sub-missions with clear commitments and timelines, enhancing political support, and fostering societal engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>.

The topic of [[public_service_skills_and_development | skills for the future]] in the public sector is a crucial subject that resonates with many involved in public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The objective is to effectively identify and develop these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape of Public Service
The [[future_of_public_employment | future of work]] in the public service is anticipated to be more digital and flexible, characterized by surprises and crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Public administrations must ensure their workforce is equipped with the right skills and management structures to effectively utilize these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This largely pertains to [[public_service_skills_and_development | talent management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

A report on [[public_service_skills_and_development | talent management]] in multi-generational public services, conducted by the OECD in partnership with the Ministry of Public Administration in Slovenia, highlights the rapidly shifting definition of "talent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Post-crisis, expectations for public service delivery are higher than ever, creating an opportunity to reconsider necessary talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It is vital to identify, integrate (through recruitment or development), and effectively utilize these skills and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Impact of Crises and Technology
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the way public administration works and transformed how employees operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. The crisis demonstrated that the public administration is not as non-flexible or resilient as its image suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This presents an opportunity to renew the image of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Challenges and Opportunities
*   **New Job Roles:** By 2030, many entering the labor market will apply for jobs that do not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Nearly half of the current workforce will require re-skilling within five years due to increased technology adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. These new jobs will demand entirely different skills, and the public sector is no exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Organizational Inertia:** Public managers face [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_sector_innovation | challenges]] such as reliance on precedent and existing policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. There is also inertia related to existing competencies, making it difficult to hire diverse talents like designers if the organization has traditionally hired economists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Organizational habits and routines, such as budget cycles or meeting schedules, also constrain change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation:** The pandemic rapidly accelerated the adoption of digital tools, proving that processes can be digitalized quickly and effectively in both private and public sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. This requires continuous learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
*   **Increased Demand and Complexity:** Public service faces unprecedented pressure and high expectations, both during and after the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. We live in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world, requiring adaptation and [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] in both public service organization and policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **Millennials in the Workforce:** The presence of millennials in the labor market, with their different mentalities and demands, combined with the age pyramid in public administrations (e.g., up to 800,000 civil servants retiring in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>), creates a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.
*   **"Super Wicked Problems":** Complex global [[global_trends_in_public_sector_innovation | problems]] like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) require new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.

## Key Skills for the Future Public Sector
Future skills in the public sector emphasize:
*   **Personal Attributes:** Building strong foundations and looking for universally applicable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Digital Skills:** The ability to use digital tools effectively and adapt to increasing technology adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Management:**
    *   Shifting from a "register directive" to a model that creates trust to achieve results, especially with hybrid teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.
    *   Focusing on results rather than just processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.
    *   Creating conditions for [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]], including spaces for mistakes and errors, and abandoning a "blame culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.
    *   Building psychological safety where staff can speak up freely and constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.
*   **Soft Skills:**
    *   Critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>
    *   Creative problem solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>
    *   Teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>

    *   Adaptation to change and its management in complex environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>
    *   Effective communication, self-leadership, effective meetings, public speaking, cross-department collaboration, and connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.
*   **Foresight and Anticipation:** Moving beyond planning the [[future of public employment | future]] based on past events to actively anticipating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.
*   **Data Analytics:** An increasingly valuable skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Approach:** Engaging more regularly with citizens and civil society organizations, being in a listening mode, and co-designing and co-developing policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. This means working more across policy silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.

## Developing Skills and Fostering Innovation
To equip the public sector for the [[future of public employment | future]], several approaches are emerging:

*   **Training Programs:** Focusing on leadership, communication, crisis management, and digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.
*   **Distributed Leadership:** Exploring models where power is distributed more widely, beyond traditional top-down hierarchies. Examples include "shadow boards" of young people to give them power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
*   **Trust-Based Management:** Leadership based on trust is crucial for achieving work results and demands a change in management culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. Trust allows for more efficient teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.
*   **Dialogue and Flexibility:** Developing working principles through dialogue with employees, such as hybrid work models and flexible working arrangements (job sharing, concentrated/flexible hours), to cater to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.
*   **Digital Collaboration Tools:** Using platforms like Mural or Miro allows participants to share ideas on an equal level, structure elements quicker, and provide clearer overviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:38">[01:04:38]</a>.
*   **"Everyone a Leader" Concept:** Empowering individuals to take ownership and excel in their roles, fostering a principle of trust throughout the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Management:** Establishing a "center of excellence" as a one-stop shop for knowledge sharing, which connects HR and technical teams across different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>. This supports collaborative training and improves internal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.
*   **Experiential Learning:** Examples include "inequality walks" to train observational skills, empathy, and the ability to engage in difficult conversations about policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>. Online versions can scale these experiences to wider audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.
*   **Creativity in Team Dynamics:** Managers found creative ways to connect with teams during the crisis, recognizing the importance of informal contact and personal connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.

### Public vs. Private Sector Considerations
While many skills and approaches are relevant to both public and private sectors, certain distinctions exist:
*   **Recruitment Speed:** The public sector is generally slower in recruiting for new needs or specialized expertise compared to the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>.
*   **Technology Deployment:** The impact of deploying new digital technologies in the public sector is immense, requiring careful integration of security dimensions and considering the sheer size of organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>.
*   **Accountability and Risk:** Public sector managers are accountable for taxpayer money, making them less prone to take risks with innovation compared to the private sector, where leadership might more easily back experimental approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.
*   **Evolving Roles:** The relative roles of public and private sectors are evolving, especially with tech giants having significant data insights into citizen behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>. This raises questions about a potential blurring of boundaries, with more private sector-type contracts and outsourcing in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>.

## Moving Forward
The future requires a commitment to not revert to old ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>. The public sector must push for transformation, breaking down silos, reforming user-centered services, introducing more experimentation, and using data for evidence-based policy decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a>. This involves renewing the image of public service as an attractive workplace with extensive use of digital technologies, remote working, and work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.

A collective effort involving public, people, and private sectors is necessary to build this new [[future of public employment | future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:12">[01:24:12]</a>.

[[innovative_public_administration_practices | Public sector innovation]] is a driving force of change, but sometimes innovation requires a push to be effectively shared and adopted widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Sharing experiences among innovators is crucial for mutual learning and to disseminate positive contributions across the entire community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Innovation Incubator Program

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), in collaboration with the European Commission, established the Innovation Incubator Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This incubator assists countries in exploring more radical innovations and anticipating future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Denmark, Romania, and Portugal participated in its pilot phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The program provides participating countries with:
*   [[international_collaboration_on_innovation | International expert advice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Peer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   Co-design elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

## Key Initiatives and Tools for Dissemination

### Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit (Portugal)

Under the incubator's guidance, Portugal developed the Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This kit is designed for [[innovative_public_administration_practices | public service]] servants and managers who are new to anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Its objective is to introduce anticipatory innovation in a format that is easy to understand, assess, and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Accelerate Estonia Partnership

OPSI has partnered with Accelerate Estonia to help disseminate lessons learned from the Innovation Incubator experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Accelerate Estonia focuses on accelerating Estonia's development by identifying societal problems and creating [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation | public-private partnerships]] to transform these problems into opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Together, OPSI and Accelerate Estonia have developed [[innovation_tools_and_methods_for_public_service | tools for incubating innovation projects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Governments can access these [[innovation_tools_and_methods_for_public_service | tools]] on OPSI's website and adapt them to their specific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Role of OPSI

OPSI functions as the global forum for [[innovative_public_administration_practices | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Its role is to support governments in understanding, testing, and [[implementing_innovative_ideas | embedding new initiatives]] to address societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This work ultimately aims to ensure that better services and policies contribute to improved lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

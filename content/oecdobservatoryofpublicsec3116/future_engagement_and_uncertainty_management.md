[[Anticipatory innovation and governance | Anticipatory innovation]] involves engaging with the future, which is inherently one of the most uncertain areas of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Despite this uncertainty, governments must engage with future possibilities because once innovations become dominant designs, they are very difficult to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## The Need for Future Engagement

Governments need to consider potential future realities even if they are not present today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. An example of this is the historical decision on which side of the road vehicles would drive, which, once made, locked in mobility systems and infrastructure development for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Today, numerous new technological and non-technological choices are emerging that will become innovations and dominant designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Therefore, governments need to be somewhat [[Leadership and organizational readiness for future challenges | ahead of the game]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. While it's not always possible to know with certainty what will happen, it is crucial to analyze and consider a variety of [[Future scenarios and strategic foresight | possible futures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This allows for the possibility of influencing emerging dominant designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

    Artificial intelligence is a major current concern, prompting questions about necessary technological and ethical solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

[[Anticipatory innovation and futures thinking | Anticipatory innovation]] is vital for identifying and shaping solutions for emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This includes determining ethical boundaries for AI or deciding whether to adopt blockchain solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. These questions can be influenced now but will likely be impossible to impact in ten or fifteen years when these technologies are widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

To ensure the best outcomes for their citizens and countries, [[Government role in managing uncertainty and complexity | governments need to anticipate what is going to happen]] and have a say in the development of these future realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Leadership plays a crucial role in fostering an environment where public officials feel safe and empowered to report corruption risks. A collaborative project between the OECD and Slovak institutions, focusing on public integrity and human behavior, highlighted the significant influence of leadership in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.

## Project Context and Objectives
The project aimed to improve capacities within the Slovak public administration to reinforce integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. It applied a [[behavioral_insights_and_their_application_in_public_integrity | behavioral risk-based approach to corruption prevention]] to identify and mitigate pressing risks within public institutions, thereby strengthening the accountability of civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. This work aligns with the OECD's 2017 recommendation on Public Integrity, which advocates for a strategic, context-dependent, and behavioral risk-based approach to combating corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

A 2022 Integrity Review of the Slovak Republic found that, while measures for [[challenges_in_corruption_risk_management | corruption risk management]] were in place, their practical application was lagging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. This is a common [[challenges_in_corruption_risk_management | challenge]] faced by many OECD countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. Slovak partners expressed interest in exploring innovative solutions, including the application of [[behavioral_insights_and_their_application_in_public_integrity | behavioral insights]], to improve these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

## The Experiment: Encouraging Risk Communication
The core question addressed by the experiment was: How can corruption be prevented in the Slovak public administration, specifically by empowering public sector employees to detect risks and feel safe reporting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>?

### Behavioral Barriers to Reporting
Through focus groups and interviews with anti-corruption coordinators and public officials, several behavioral barriers to reporting corruption risks were identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>:
*   **"Ticking the Box" Behavior by Managers** Managers formally complied with procedures but did not act in line with the public sector's code of conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:42]</a>.
*   **Misreporting** Managers tended to misreport progress to meet European obligations, stating actions were done when they had not fully progressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>.
*   **Underutilization of Reporting Channels** An existing electronic survey for reporting risks was not encouraged by managers and was underused by employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.
*   **Culture of Fear and Silence** The primary barrier identified was that employees were not speaking up about corruption risks due to a culture of fear and silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>. This was particularly true for *potential* risks, as opposed to clear incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>.

The project ultimately focused on encouraging employees to speak up about corruption risks, as other behaviors were either hard to measure or context-specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>.

### Drivers of Non-Reporting
Key reasons employees did not speak up included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>:
*   **Lack of [[the_role_of_trust_and_leadership_in_public_service | leadership]] Examples** Leaders themselves were not speaking up about corruption risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Understanding of Channels** Employees were often unaware of existing reporting channels like the electronic survey or direct communication with managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.
*   **Psychological Costs and Fear of Retaliation** The perception of potential retaliation prevented people from feeling safe enough to speak up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Feedback Loop** Employees felt that even if they reported a risk, there was no feedback mechanism to show what action would be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.

### Experiment Design
A randomized vignette experiment was conducted with 2,537 public officials from line ministries and central authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[00:25:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:33:00">[00:30:33]</a>. Participants were presented with a hypothetical scenario involving a suspected corruption risk in hiring procedures due to a lack of control measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[00:27:15]</a>.

Two interventions were tested against a control group (no intervention):
1.  **Understanding of Risk Message:** Aimed to improve the understanding of what constitutes a risk by providing an analogy to health (e.g., smoking and cancer detection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[00:27:57]</a>.
2.  **Exemplary [[the_role_of_trust_and_leadership_in_public_service | Leadership]] Message:** Appealed to the influence of managers by imagining a manager who actively raises hiring risks and encourages colleagues to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:00">[00:28:50]</a>.

Both messages incorporated injunctive social norms, reminding civil servants of their duty to be honest and report risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[00:29:29]</a>.

## Key Findings
*   **Impact of Interventions:** Both behavioral interventions increased the likelihood of reporting risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:56:00">[00:33:56]</a>:
    *   The **[[the_role_of_trust_and_leadership_in_public_service | leadership]] message** was the most impactful, increasing the likelihood of communication by approximately 14 percentage points compared to the control group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29:00">[00:33:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[00:39:16]</a>.
    *   The **understanding of risk message** increased the likelihood by approximately 9 percentage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[00:33:42]</a>.
*   **Age Correlation:** Younger respondents were significantly more likely to communicate a corruption risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[00:34:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:20:00">[00:34:20]</a>. An increase in age by one year decreased the likelihood to communicate an integrity risk by 0.23 percentage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:29:00">[00:34:29]</a>. This could be due to a greater fear of retaliation or status quo bias among more senior employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. Career length, however, was not found to correlate with reporting likelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:39:00">[00:34:39]</a>.
*   **Feeling of Safety:** People reported feeling generally safer after being asked whom they would report a risk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[00:35:00]</a>. Both treatments slightly increased this feeling of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[00:35:32]</a>. Those who preferred to communicate a risk to their manager felt significantly safer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:00">[00:35:52]</a>.
*   **[[Public trust and governance | Trust]] in the System:** [[Public trust and governance | Trust]] in the risk management system correlated with a feeling of safety and likelihood to communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:00">[00:36:58]</a>. People who trusted the system were more likely to feel safe and report risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:01:00">[00:37:01]</a>.
*   **Understanding of Risk:** On average, only 30.8% of respondents correctly identified the vignette situation as a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[00:37:40]</a>. Neither treatment significantly improved the understanding of what constitutes a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:02:00">[00:38:02]</a>.

## Recommendations for Slovakia and Beyond
Based on these findings, three main axes of work are recommended for Slovakia's new National Anti-Corruption Strategy (2024-2029) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:41:00">[00:38:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[00:38:52]</a>:

1.  **Empower [[role_of_leadership_in_public_sector_innovation | leaders]] to set the standard:** The strong impact of the [[the_role_of_trust_and_leadership_in_public_service | leadership]] message underscores the need for leaders to act with integrity and set the example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:22:00">[00:39:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[00:39:31]</a>. Providing training for leaders to equip them with the necessary knowledge, skills, and resources is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35:00">[00:39:35]</a>.
2.  **Make the risk communication process easy and understood:** Since employees prefer reporting to their managers, policies should be designed to support this and ensure they feel safe doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[00:40:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[00:40:50]</a>. Raising awareness of existing reporting channels and implementing clear, concise, and behaviorally informed guidelines is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:59:00">[00:40:59]</a>.
3.  **Cultivate a culture of safety:** Feelings of safety are a key enabler for people to speak up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[00:41:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:44:00">[00:41:44]</a>. This requires fostering an environment where speaking out is a social norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[00:41:48]</a>. The importance of [[the_role_of_trust_and_leadership_in_public_service | trust]] in the system and feedback mechanisms cannot be overstated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>.

The study serves as an inspiring example of how [[behavioral_insights_and_their_application_in_public_integrity | behavioral insights]] can be applied to complex policy issues like anti-corruption, offering concrete lines of action and demonstrating the magnitude of impact achievable through well-designed interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. Continued testing and scaling up of these interventions in real-world settings are seen as the "next frontier" for strengthening public integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.

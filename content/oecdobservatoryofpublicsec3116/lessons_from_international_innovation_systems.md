This article draws lessons on [[public_sector_innovation_fundamentals | public sector innovation]] systems from work with Canada, including insights from other countries like the UK, Australia, Denmark, France, and Brazil. The core message is that while innovation is crucial for governments in a changing world, it is inherently difficult to master, and no country has yet achieved a perfect system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:15">[06:17:15]</a>.

## Understanding Public Sector Innovation Systems

A "system" comprises the elements that inform those within it about what is expected, even without explicit instructions, such as appetite for innovation, standards, processes, and protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:07">[08:44:07]</a>. An "innovation system" specifically refers to the factors, components, and practices that influence the occurrence and extent of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:59">[09:13:59]</a>.

Key observations about existing innovation systems:
*   An innovation system already exists in governments; the goal is to make it more deliberate and explicit to ensure innovation happens at the desired level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:44">[09:23:44]</a>.
*   Understanding the system requires looking at past beliefs, learned lessons, achievements, the "lived experience" of innovation, and its dynamic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:02">[10:09:02]</a>.
*   Innovation is often ad-hoc, reactive, and opportunistic, rather than a consistent, deliberate, and reliable resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:49">[06:47:49]</a>.
*   Governments must innovate to remain relevant and effective in an evolving economy, as policy settings need to change just to maintain the same level of outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:17">[07:03:17]</a>.
*   Innovation requires hands-on engagement and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:07">[07:27:07]</a>.
*   There is a risk of a mismatch if governments fail to innovate, leading to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:04">[07:45:04]</a>.
*   Innovation needs to be a core competency and systemic, repeatable, and consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:06">[07:56:06]</a>.

### Challenges in Public Sector Innovation
A significant challenge is the ongoing struggle to balance appropriate controls with allowing for change and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:26">[06:00:26]</a>. This is partly because innovation is an ambiguous concept, hard to define and measure, especially when doing something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:09">[14:38:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:44:45">[57:44:45]</a>. Rational individuals in public service tend to focus on clearly understood agendas that are easier to track and report on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:08">[14:55:08]</a>.

Other observed challenges include:
*   **Reliance on individuals:** Innovation often depends on "the right person being in the right place at the right time" rather than the merit of ideas or systemic need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:03">[15:49:03]</a>. This makes innovation reliant on individual effort and not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:09">[21:50:09]</a>.
*   **Marginalized activity:** The practice of innovation, while developing, remains marginal and not viewed as core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:60">[20:31:60]</a>.
*   **Risk aversion:** Public services are inherently risk-averse. The challenge is not to eliminate risk, but to balance it by increasing awareness of the risks of *not* innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>.

## Determinants of Public Sector Innovation

To make innovation more systemic, a model considering three levels of analysis is proposed: individual, organizational, and system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:32">[20:58:32]</a>. If system elements are not in place, innovation falls to the organizational level, and if organizational elements are lacking, it falls to individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:07">[21:19:07]</a>.

Four key determinants shape whether and how innovation occurs in the public sector, contrasting them with the private sector:

### 1. Clarity
*   **Definition:** The presence of a clear signal within the system about why innovation is wanted and needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>.
*   **Private Sector:** Profit provides a strong, clear, constant signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:14">[24:10:14]</a>.
*   **Public Sector:** The signal is "politics," which is changeable, noisy, and often involves multiple competing signals, making innovation secondary to clearer agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:08">[24:24:08]</a>.
*   **Intervention points:**
    *   Building a shared understanding of what innovation means (e.g., Denmark's innovation barometer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:60">[30:44:60]</a>.
    *   Understanding innovation's relation to other priorities (e.g., France's manifesto on public sector innovation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>.
    *   Defining roles in the innovation system (e.g., Denmark's eight innovation archetypes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:48">[32:40:48]</a>.
    *   Connecting innovation to the shared history and context of the public service (e.g., changing the narrative about public servants' roles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:08">[33:43:08]</a>.

### 2. Parity
*   **Definition:** Innovation having an equal standing with other considerations when evaluating proposed actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:37">[25:57:37]</a>.
*   **Private Sector:** A "marketplace for ideas" where an idea can be taken elsewhere if an employer doesn't adopt it, creating a competitive threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>.
*   **Public Sector:** No competitive threat; ideas must contend with incumbent practices unless there's a clear need or opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:37">[25:31:37]</a>.
*   **Intervention points:**
    *   Processes open to challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>.
    *   Ability to circumvent bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>.
    *   Finding allies for innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:16:00">[37:16:00]</a>.
    *   Navigating risk and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:19:00">[37:19:00]</a>.

### 3. Suitability
*   **Definition:** The capability systems and infrastructure are appropriate and sufficient for available innovative options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:31:00">[37:31:00]</a>.
*   **Private Sector:** Strong feedback loops lead to investment in emergent opportunities, and what works gets scaled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a>.
*   **Public Sector:** Feedback loops favor what is already understood. Waiting until something is fully understood makes government a "taker" rather than a "shaper," reducing absorptive capacity for new innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:00">[26:36:00]</a>.
*   **Intervention points:**
    *   Parts of the system learning and keeping pace with external change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:47:00">[37:47:00]</a>.
    *   Socializing technology within the public service and exposing leaders to new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:03:00">[38:03:00]</a>.
    *   Exploring new operational models (e.g., Talent Cloud in Canada for HR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:14:00">[38:14:00]</a>.
    *   Tracking changing expectations from citizens and government to drive internal change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>.

### 4. Normality
*   **Definition:** Innovation is seen as integral to operations, rather than an occasionally accepted deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>.
*   **Private Sector:** If something generates profit, it's accepted as normal, regardless of perceived foolishness, due to clear feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>.
*   **Public Sector:** Innovation is often viewed as an exception or "frolic," making it hard to embed into routine core workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>.
*   **Intervention points:**
    *   Clear behaviors supporting innovation, shifting from replicating and standardizing to allowing difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:00">[39:12:00]</a>.
    *   Efforts to link innovation with regular business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:24:00">[39:24:00]</a>.
    *   Socializing and celebrating innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[39:30:00]</a>.
    *   Upholding and defending innovation when things go wrong, as experiments will fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:33:00">[39:33:00]</a>.

These determinants are interdependent. For example, without clarity, it's hard to achieve parity, and innovation won't become normal if not invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>. A system performs only as strong as its weakest part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Cultivating Innovation

### Balancing Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches
For large, complex, and changeable systems, a balance is needed between top-down direction and grassroots efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. In a dynamic world, the need for innovation can strike anywhere, requiring everyone to have some capacity to engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. Public servants often feel they need explicit permission to innovate, even when it might have already been implicitly granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.

### Addressing the "Clay Layer" (Middle Management)
Frustration with middle management is a universal structural issue in bureaucratic organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>. Strategies to overcome this include:
*   Creating forums for sharing and developing ideas to a more sophisticated level before requiring direct management attention (e.g., internal platforms like GCconnects and GCcollab in Canada) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>.
*   Developing strong storytelling skills to tailor proposals to resonate with middle management's primary concerns, such as risk or communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

### Measuring and Communicating Impact
Measuring innovation is difficult because it involves new activities without established standards or performance targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:44:45">[57:44:45]</a>. However, a shift towards focusing on outcomes rather than activities is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. This means defining impact as "impact X on population Y resulting in a better outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:54:33">[59:54:33]</a>.

Recommendations include:
*   **Working in the open:** Proactively communicating expected outcomes and publishing information publicly fosters transparency and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.
*   **Evergreen process:** Regularly assessing data and implementation successes allows for agility and adaptation if initial outcomes prove inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.
*   **Paying for outcomes:** Structuring initiatives to pay only when the outcome is achieved, not just when activities are completed, can be a better risk strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.

### Responding to Disruptive Change
Governments need to move towards an anticipatory innovation system that actively shapes the future rather than merely reacting to emergent, disruptive shifts like blockchain or AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>. While the costs of being surprised are well understood in some sectors (e.g., defense, medicine), this is less common across much of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. Key foundational pieces, such as robust data collection and usage strategies, are essential for effectively applying disruptive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.

### Encouraging Experimentation
For example, Canada's commitment to experimentation creates a structural force that explicitly makes experimenting acceptable and expected, thus reducing individual risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>. Government declarations like the FPT Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation_and_global_trends | Public Sector Innovation]] provide implicit approval for public servants to explore and do things differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>.

### Conclusion

While the context for [[public_sector_innovation_fundamentals | public sector innovation]] varies across countries, the fundamental drivers of innovation activity, and the challenges faced, show significant resonance. The aim of this work is to make the implicit dynamics of innovation systems explicit, empowering individuals to see themselves as part of and contributors to shaping the system, rather than being passively subjected to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. This requires a collective effort, acknowledging that everyone can play a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>.

The contemporary world is characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and novelty, requiring governments to adopt new approaches to deal with complex problems and respond to environmental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is developing an Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG) framework to help governments prepare for and shape future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Why Anticipate Change?

Governments operate in a world where issues are complex and new developments, both technological and otherwise, constantly emerge from the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The objective of government is to be prepared and define a desirable future, which necessitates anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Traditional practices and policies within government can become outdated as external conditions change and new ideas emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This presents an "innovator's dilemma," where current stakeholders might not express a need for new, potentially disruptive innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Early, imperfect ideas may underperform existing systems, making it difficult to gain stakeholder buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Additionally, the focus of leadership on current challenges can divert attention from future risks and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

Ignoring upcoming transformations, whether technological or non-technological, is not an option, as demonstrated by the challenges faced by large private sector companies like Canon and Nokia that relied solely on current customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## The Challenge of Technological Change

A specific challenge governments face is the "Collingridge dilemma," which highlights the inverse relationship between the possibility to control technological change and the evidence of its potential impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. In early phases of technological development, control is higher, but evidence of impact is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. As evidence of impact grows, the ability to control diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This was exemplified by the rise of platforms like Uber, where early influence was possible, but once millions of users adopted the technology, rolling back changes became very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

This implies that governments must consider technological and non-technological changes early on to influence their values and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. It requires a different way of thinking about evidence and experimentation in government, moving away from a "wait and see" position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

## Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG)

Governments often view the future from a static perspective, such as through traditional futures cones for long-term strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. However, anticipating innovation requires a continuous practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

[[role_of_governments_in_innovation_and_future_planning | Futures are created through present dialogue]] and continuous interaction between different people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Therefore, anticipatory innovation practice, while future-looking, is grounded in present action, involving experimenting and developing ideas to test possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. This ensures governments are not caught off guard or in situations where they cannot influence the future once it has happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

### Distinguishing AIG from Related Concepts

*   **Anticipation** is the act of creating knowledge about the future, drawing from existing factors, values, worldviews, assumptions, and emerging developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   **Strategic Foresight** is exceptionally important for providing input into anticipation by identifying signals about upcoming events, reading weak signals, and validating strong signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. However, foresight often faces an "impact gap," where its insights are not translated into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Governments have had scenarios on global pandemics since at least 2017, yet little action was taken, leading to a tactical response during the 2020 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Innovation** is acting upon that knowledge to change systems (processes, services, products) and explore alternative futures to influence the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory Innovation Governance** is the system of structures, institutions, agencies, and the environment that supports the activity of anticipation and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. It addresses the "impact gap" by providing mechanisms for taking foresight knowledge and developing value-shifting innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.
*   **Resilience** aims to make a system more prepared for external shocks so it can expand but not break, upholding its core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. Anticipatory innovation can feed into resilience, but it's not the same; sometimes, anticipation shows that the system should fundamentally change rather than just be resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
*   **Adaptation/Agility** refers to the capacity to respond tactically and adapt quickly to ongoing changes, often during a crisis, without much strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. Anticipatory innovation strengthens both resilient and adaptive capacities by ensuring that actions taken are moving in the right strategic direction and considering broader implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.
*   **Mission-driven innovation** is led by a single, agreed-upon purpose or goal, such as decarbonizing the economy by a specific timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>. Anticipatory innovation, however, helps in considering unexpected outcomes and side effects of these missions, ensuring that the focus on a single goal doesn't lead to new, unanticipated challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

### Building an Anticipatory Innovation Governance System

Building an AIG system involves simultaneously developing five key system elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>:

1.  **Demand**: Cultivating a leadership culture that actively seeks and demands strategic foresight and anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
2.  **Capacity**: Developing the knowledge and skills within government, such as horizon scanners and scenario planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
3.  **Embeddedness**: Ensuring that other elements of the government system, like electoral cycles and policy reviews, are coordinated with anticipatory activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. It's crucial to plan in advance how, when, and by whom insights will be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
4.  **Institutions**: Establishing teams and organizations responsible for anticipatory innovation, ensuring they connect with wider stakeholders and decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.
5.  **Feedback**: Implementing systems to evaluate how well anticipation was used and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

Examples from practice illustrate how governments are working to build AIG:
*   **Finland**: Possesses one of the most advanced strategic foresight systems in government, but is still working on the implementation challenge of integrating foresight knowledge into decision-making and innovation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.
*   **Helsingborg, Sweden**: Consciously decided to become an anticipatory organization, starting by building leadership capacity to engage with futures, foresight, and anticipatory issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>. This led to decisions to support anticipatory innovation projects as "test beds" and integrate learnings into broader city practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.
*   **Ireland**: The government is actively working with the OECD to understand how to build an AIG system, outlining roles and capacities needed to translate identified risks and opportunities from foresight into action-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.
*   **Slovenia**: Working on specific topics like the future of the public sector and talent management within the context of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>.
*   **Latvia**: Deeply engaged in [[technological_advancements_in_governance | technological development]] and building anticipatory ecosystems around different technologies from a public sector perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>.

### The Multi-Disciplinary Nature of Change

[[governments_role_in_promoting_innovation | Innovation]] is often seen as solely technology-related, but it is increasingly multi- and trans-disciplinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. When looking at technology, it's crucial to consider its design, flaws, and opportunities, and how these influence human interaction from a human-centric or system design perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>. Digitalization, for instance, allows for both centralization and personalization/decentralization of services, with fundamental ripple effects in a human context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>.

Conversely, human and social contexts also drive the need for specific technological solutions or choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. Technology should serve as an instrumental tool for addressing challenges and achieving preferable futures, not as an end goal in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>. For instance, a smart city vision should focus on seamless services addressing inequality and improving living, rather than just on technological choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>. An anticipatory approach requires looking at change from both technological and human/social perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>.

## Moving Forward

Anticipatory innovation requires a different type of measurement and evaluation system than standard public sector practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:39">[01:24:39]</a>. The OECD continues to explore these mechanisms and work with governments to build robust AIG systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.

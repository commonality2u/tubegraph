The "Government Aftershock High-Level Forum" convened a global dialogue to explore the role and expectations of government during crises, focusing on building back better together and reaffirming the role of [[innovative_approaches_to_public_governance | citizen-centered governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The forum, which included over 4,500 participants in 60 local conversations worldwide, featured distinguished panelists from Costa Rica, Scotland, Dublin City University, and Civicus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Role of Government and Citizen Engagement in Crisis

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical [[role_of_government_in_crisis_response | role of government in crisis response]] and intensified the need for citizen engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Governments recognize that their public governance relies on citizen support and fulfillment of expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. There is a strong consensus that engaging with citizens is more crucial now than before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

Costa Ricaâ€™s Deputy Minister of National Planning and Economic Policy, Mr. Molina Rodriguez, noted that while the focus remains on service delivery, existing instruments have shown limitations in being truly tailored to every citizen's expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Expectations often prioritize urgent rather than strategic gaps, such as in education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Scotland, with a pre-existing strong focus on [[citizen_participation_in_anticipatory_governance | citizen participation]] through its national performance framework, found that COVID-19 magnified the need for deeper and quicker engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This engagement is vital for citizens to understand and comply with measures to deal with the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Gary Gillespie, Chief Economist for the Scottish government, emphasized that higher compliance and [[effective_communication_and_citizen_trust_in_crisis | higher trust in governments]] result from greater availability of information, fostering cohesiveness and [[citizen_participation_in_anticipatory_governance | citizen participation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Challenges to Effective Citizen Engagement

Despite the recognized need for engagement, several challenges hinder its effectiveness:

*   **Urgency vs. Strategy**: The immediate demands of a crisis often force out strategic planning for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide**: [[Impact of COVID19 on government and citizen relations | Digitalization]], while offering new avenues, presents a significant gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:46">[02:00:46]</a>. Less advantaged, rural, or elderly populations may not have access to or feel empowered to engage on digital platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **Exclusion of Vulnerable Populations**: Traditional engagement mechanisms like polls may exclude the most vulnerable populations who lack access to necessary literacy or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>.
*   **Misinformation and Disinformation**: Combating misperceptions and conspiracy theories is a major challenge, as they drive non-compliance with public health measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Restriction of Civic Space**: While engagement has increased, there have also been restrictions on freedoms, censorship, and limitations on access to information, undermining accountability and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. This includes threats and arrests for criticizing state responses and crackdowns on protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Police Abuses and Privacy Violations**: Lockdowns have seen police abuses, surveillance, and violations of privacy rights due to new app installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   **Technical Complexity**: Policy proposals often become technically complex, making it difficult for non-expert populations to understand and engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

## Innovative Approaches and Lessons Learned

### Government Innovations
Governments are adapting by:
*   **Direct Engagement Measures**: Scotland introduced weekly polls to gauge understanding and compliance with government messages, and the First Minister led daily press briefings to explain rationale behind decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Senior officials also explained impacts of restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Adopting a "Kindness, Dignity, and Compassion" Framework**: Scotland's national performance framework, informed by citizen consultations, guides their engagement approach, emphasizing treating people with kindness, dignity, and compassion, respecting the rule of law, and acting openly and transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.
*   **Community-Centered Policing**: Scotland's police approach during COVID-19 followed "four Es": engage, explain, encourage, and only if needed, enforce, based on the consent of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   **Promoting Humility and Listening**: Governments must be willing to admit they don't have all the answers and genuinely listen to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. This includes gathering "lived experience" to inform policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.
*   **Transparent Communication of Evolving Evidence**: Public health officials openly communicate what is known at the moment, the evidence, and the justification, acknowledging that information evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **Digital Platforms and In-depth Surveys**: While challenging for inclusivity, digital platforms are used for engagement. In-depth survey work, providing citizens with evidence before asking for input, and explaining how citizen feedback influenced actions, builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Shared Responsibility Frameworks**: Governments cannot solve all expectations alone and must boost shared responsibility frameworks, including Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) and decent work legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Citizens are increasingly becoming implementers and contributors to public policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.

### Civil Society Innovations
Civil society groups have shown high agility in responding to the crisis:
*   **Rapid Humanitarian Support**: Community-based organizations were quick to provide emergency support, reaching vulnerable populations often overlooked by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
*   **Safeguarding Against Misinformation**: Civil society played a crucial role in countering misinformation through innovative campaigns, awareness-raising, and community outreach, using tools like art and graffiti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.
*   **Accountability and Transparency Monitoring**: They engaged in monitoring in-kind distribution of food and services, and demanded greater visibility regarding foreign funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.
*   **Adapting Engagement Methods**: Civil society moved to digital spaces, customizing engagement for virtual environments, but also recognized the importance of offline discussions and using local champions to reach those without digital access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.
*   **Partnership with Local Governments**: Significant work was done with municipalities in awareness-raising and delivering support to communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.

## Building Resilience and Trust for the Future

The crisis has accelerated changes in how governments engage with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. Future engagement should move beyond formal consultation to more direct, co-productive methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. Key elements for strengthening citizen engagement practices to be resilient and ready for future crises include:

*   **Prioritizing the Principle of Listening**: Governments and local authorities must have a fundamental commitment to listen, understand concerns, and bring people along, rather than imposing rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Informed Engagement**: Citizens should engage with evidence, not just "top of the head thoughts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
*   **Actionable Feedback**: It is crucial that citizen input results in action to avoid cynicism and build [[effective_communication_and_citizen_trust_in_crisis | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>.
*   **Radical and Inclusive Partnership**: Moving from a market-based approach (government services as demand/offer) to "radical partnership" where citizens are viewed as constituents, not just clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. This involves being inclusive of vulnerable populations and co-designing solutions and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:17">[02:00:17]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sector Collaboration**: Beyond government-citizen relations, deeper collaboration across public services, with philanthropy, and with businesses is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. This includes empowering public agencies to break silos and work together on multi-dimensional policy challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>.
*   **Building System Resilience**: Focus on building the resilience of systems, society, and communities to better respond to future shocks, which are expected to become more frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.
*   **Sustaining Changes**: The speed of change and direct engagement observed during the pandemic should not revert to more formal, siloed methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. It's okay not to have all the answers at the start; processes can evolve with evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.

## Poll Results on Citizen Engagement
A poll conducted during the forum revealed strong support for increased citizen engagement:
*   **Need for Engagement**: 89.3% of participants believe there is a need to engage with citizens more now than before the onset of COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Only 10.7% disagreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.
*   **Government Engagement Efforts Since COVID-19**:
    *   18.8% reported that their government made great efforts to involve citizens in COVID-19 discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.
    *   59.4% said their government engaged with citizens in a collaborative way, but in a limited manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.
    *   21.8% indicated that their government had not had an opportunity to engage with citizens collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

Panelists viewed these results as encouraging, noting that despite the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, a significant portion of governments had initiated or intensified engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.

## Personal Commitments for the Future
Panelists shared their personal commitments for future action:
*   **Advocating for Civic Space**: Mona Benara of Civicus committed to being more "radical" about [[impact_of_crisis_on_public_trust_and_governance | civic space]] and fundamental freedoms, challenging narratives that authoritarian regimes were more successful, and pushing for the right of people to express themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.
*   **Fostering Significant Partnerships**: Benara also emphasized moving towards more significant partnerships and collaboration, shifting from a client-based relationship to one where citizens are recognized as the source of legitimacy and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>.
*   **Bridging Academia and Real World**: Jane Suiter, from Dublin City University, committed to making her research open access and dedicating a significant portion of her time to working in the real world, bringing expertise to help citizens, [[innovative_government_responses_to_the_crisis | governments]], and [[citizen_participation_in_anticipatory_governance | civil society]] protect democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.
*   **Building Systemic Resilience**: Gary Gillespie of Scotland committed to building the resilience of systems, society, and communities to respond better to future shocks and address pre-existing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. He aims to empower people to be part of the solution through co-production and exploring how businesses can drive change towards a greener, fairer, and more inclusive economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.
*   **Focusing on the Excluded**: Deputy Minister Molina Rodriguez emphasized the need to prioritize identifying and including those citizens who lack access to engagement and participation platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. This includes boosting investment in accessible means like household internet access and using readily available tools like phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>. He also highlighted the importance of continuous adaptation and revision of routines based on pilot experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>.

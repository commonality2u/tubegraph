The Innovation Facets Model is a framework developed by the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) to understand and manage public sector innovation portfolios for collective system change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This model describes the broad purposes of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. It is recognized as one of many frameworks for portfolio analysis and management, and while not necessarily the "best," its use is seen as beneficial for intentional focus on the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Components of the Model: Four Facets of Innovation

The OPSI [[four_facets_of_innovation | Innovation Facets Model]] differentiates innovation into four distinct purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>:

*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>: This facet focuses on overall challenges and societal goals, orienting action from a top-down and directed approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **[[Enhancementoriented innovation | Enhancement-Oriented Innovation]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>: This involves taking existing practices and making them better, more efficient, and more widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>: This addresses new and expressed needs that require action, creating spaces for bottom-up exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>: This looks at extreme uncertainty, shaping changes based on things that might happen in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Application and Purpose

The model serves as a framing device for clarification, sense-making, and orienting future action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. It helps organizations understand their current [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation portfolios]] and consider how to transition them towards overarching goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:49">[01:22:49]</a>.

## Research Questions and Challenges

Research questions guide the application of the Innovation Facets Model and highlight [[challenges_of_a_multifaceted_innovation_approach | challenges of a multifaceted innovation approach]]:

*   What led to the current portfolio, considering policy context, organizational environment, and goals? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>
*   Who is stewarding the portfolio (explicit role or implicit team)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
*   Are there strategies and policies supporting each facet, and what are they? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a> Most organizations tend to be strong in one or two facets, often reflecting efficiency or challenge-focused policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   Is the current balance of the innovation portfolio indicative of a temporary or long-term trend? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>
*   Is the balance of the portfolio supportive of the overall organizational remit or public purpose? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a> Portfolios may sometimes be at odds with stated organizational objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   What roles do different [[Innovation Ecosystems | ecosystem]] actors play in shaping the portfolio? It's important to look beyond internal organizational remits to external influences and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   What roles are needed to steward [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation portfolios]] within teams, organizations, or wider ecosystems? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>

## Stewardship in Multi-Stakeholder Environments

The model is particularly relevant in multi-stakeholder environments where no single entity has absolute control over innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Key aspects of stewardship include:

*   **Collective Action**: How to get everyone involved and aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Building and Sustaining Momentum**: Especially for long-term portfolio transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Managing Diversity**: Addressing the inherent diversity of interests and contexts among stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:03">[01:35:03]</a>.
*   **Learning and Reflexivity**: Integrating structured reflection and learning histories to adapt practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:25">[01:55:25]</a>.

## Integration with Other Frameworks

The Innovation Facets Model can be combined with other approaches. For instance, in Lund, Sweden, the model has been overlaid with a "zone model" that describes different stages of innovation (from uncertain exploration to implementation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. This integrated approach allows for visualizing activities and their progression, identifying handover points between different actors in the [[Innovation Ecosystems | innovation ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

### Future By Lund's Approach

Future By Lund, an innovation platform in the municipality of Lund, uses the model as part of its governance framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. They envision using it to:

*   **Map Innovation Assets**: Following models like the Global Institute for Innovation Districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>.
*   **Track Dynamism**: Use annual snapshots to monitor the evolution of the portfolio of activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.
*   **Facilitate Discussions**: Engage partners in discussions about where projects are situated within the facets and what actions are needed to move them towards implementation and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>. This often involves identifying gaps and finding the right stakeholders to take over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.

### Viable Cities' Approach

Viable Cities, a Swedish program focused on achieving climate-neutral cities by 2030, uses a mission-oriented approach that aligns well with the Innovation Facets Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:10">[02:29:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:21">[02:29:21]</a>. Their key tools include:

*   **Climate City Contract**: A core instrument for stewarding ownership and commitments to the portfolio, revised and signed yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:44">[01:13:44]</a>.
*   **Transition Lab**: A mechanism for accelerating learning for climate transition, clarifying common direction, leveraging synergies, and renewing decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Open Calls**: Used to connect across portfolios and countries, like the Climate Smart Cities Challenge, to focus diverse stakeholders and identify committed partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>.

## Related Concepts

### [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | Innovation Portfolios and Management]]

The Innovation Facets Model is primarily a tool for guiding and analyzing [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation portfolios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The concept of an "innovation portfolio" implies a mix of innovative activities, whether intentional or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The model helps question if the current mix is satisfactory and what the desired mix should be, often influenced by public values and political considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

A key emerging idea is the "portfolio of portfolios," recognizing the need to align efforts and connect activities across different actors and governance levels, particularly in multi-stakeholder environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.

### [[Innovation Ecosystems | Innovation Ecosystems]] and Multi-Stakeholder Environments

The model helps in managing innovation within complex [[Innovation Ecosystems | ecosystems]] where no single entity has complete control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. This requires focusing on building legitimacy for collective action, sustaining momentum, and understanding the roles of diverse actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

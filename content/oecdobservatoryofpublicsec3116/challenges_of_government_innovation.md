[[Innovation in government | Innovation]] offers an opportunity for governments to adapt and thrive in an increasingly complex and uncertain world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It enables proactive approaches, builds trust between governments and citizens, explores uncertainty, and ultimately improves public outcomes and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Despite the clear [[Reasons for government innovation | reasons for government innovation]], the public sector often faces significant [[Challenges faced by governments that require innovation | challenges]] in adopting and sustaining innovative practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Key [[Challenges faced by governments that require innovation | Challenges]]

Discussions with practitioners and survey respondents highlight several common barriers to [[innovation in government | innovation]]:

### Mindset and Culture
One of the biggest barriers is a deeply ingrained mindset that resists change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>. This includes:
-   **Lack of Vision and Leadership:** A significant challenge is the "lack of vision and leadership to move on from old ways" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Many public managers are "willing to acknowledge lessons learned but not as willing to change their behaviors or take action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
-   **Risk Avoidance Behavior:** Governments often exhibit risk aversion, making it difficult to try new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. Lena Collier states that the initial step of involving citizens in co-creation required signatures from three permanent secretaries, illustrating the bureaucratic hurdles to even simple engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.
-   **Fear of Losing Control/Incompetence:** Public servants, especially senior ones, may fear being seen as incompetent when invited to tackle issues in different, innovative ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>.
-   **Magnetism of Business as Usual:** There's a strong tendency to stick to the status quo, even when new approaches are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. Peter Pogbachar emphasizes that "public administration should not mouse back to its normal old ways of working as they were before the pandemic because the old ways of working will not be able to keep up with the fast paced pace of changes in the workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>.

### Structural and Systemic Issues
Beyond individual mindsets, systemic issues hinder [[public sector innovation]]:
-   **Strict Hierarchies and Decision-Making:** Hierarchical structures make it difficult to leverage the full potential and knowledge of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>, limiting bottom-up [[innovation in government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
-   **Bureaucracy and Regulation:** Rules and regulations, particularly in procurement, can block experimentation and new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. Matia Codra notes that current legal frameworks may not effectively encourage [[innovation in government | innovation]] and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>.
-   **Lack of Unifying Vision/Strategic Frameworks:** The absence of a clear, shared vision or strategic framework can make it hard to align efforts and drive [[innovation in government | innovation]] systemically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.
-   **Inter-governmental Divergence:** Differences in approaches or priorities between national and local governments can create friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.
-   **Mobility of Civil Servants:** While beneficial for individuals, high mobility in the civil service makes it difficult to invest in and sustain innovation networks and agendas long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

### Resources and Capabilities
Practical resource and capability gaps also impede [[innovation in government | innovation]]:
-   **[[Challenges in public sector innovation funding | Lack of Financial and Political Support]]:** Leaders often seek quick results but may not provide the necessary long-term financial and political support for [[innovation in government | innovation]] initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. The immediate cost of change can be hard to justify when results aren't instantaneous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
-   **Skills Gaps:** There is a notable "lack of knowledge, skills, and tools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>, particularly in "social [[innovation in government | innovation]] skills" such as collaboration, inclusion, co-creation, and systems thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. Often, there's a lack of "primary skills like listening and thinking," leading to rushed solutions without proper problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.
-   **Proof of Concept and Measurement Challenges:** Proving the concept and demonstrating the impact of [[innovation in government | innovation]] are difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### External Factors
-   **Reaching Forgotten Groups:** Ensuring that [[innovation in government | innovation]] benefits all citizens, especially "groups that feel forgotten or left behind," remains a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## [[Strategies for fostering government innovation | Strategies for Addressing Challenges]]

Panelists and the OECD have identified several [[Strategies for fostering government innovation | strategies]] to overcome these [[Challenges faced by governments that require innovation | challenges]]:

-   **Start by Starting:** Begin where it's possible, even if it's small, and don't wait for the entire system to be ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>. Consistency over a long period is crucial for building [[innovation in government | innovation]] infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
-   **Focus on Core Business and Problem-Oriented Approach:** [[Innovation in government | Innovation]] should be integral to core business, not just "whipped cream" or a "fun game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>. Framing [[innovation in government | innovation]] around concrete, pressing problems (e.g., climate change, demographic shifts) resonates better with politicians and senior managers than abstract concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>.
-   **Build Networks and Communities:** Fostering a collective approach to [[innovation in government | innovation]] reduces the burden on individuals and allows for shared learning and influence over culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>. Matia Codra highlights the importance of the "[[innovation in government | innovation]] community" and "[[innovation in government | innovation]] ambassadors" in Slovenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.
-   **Engage Leadership through Trust and Relevance:** Gain insights into management's objectives and demonstrate how [[innovation in government | innovation]] can help achieve those results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:39">[01:08:39]</a>. Build trust and communicate results early, rather than just focusing on the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.
-   **Cultivate Open Mindsets:** Work with individuals who are open to new approaches and ideas, forming a "coalition of the willing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>.
-   **Invest in Training and Skills Development:** Provide employees with knowledge and training in new methods and skills, particularly "social [[innovation in government | innovation]] skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>.
-   **Create Safe Experimental Spaces:** Establish environments where mistakes are allowed, and new mechanisms can be introduced and tested without severe penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
-   **Leverage Regulation for [[Innovation in government | Innovation]]:** Explore how regulations can be adapted to encourage experimentation, such as Denmark's "free municipality" experiments, which provide a structural framework for testing new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>. This can have a significant cultural impact by legitimizing experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.
-   **Measure [[Innovation in government | Innovation]] Maturity:** Systematically measuring [[innovation in government | innovation]] maturity can help track progress and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.
-   **Utilize Global Networks and Best Practices:** Learn from the experiences of other countries and adapt successful approaches to local contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>.

The report, "Harnessing Mission Governance to Achieve National Climate Targets," examines how [[mission_setting_and_policy_making | mission-oriented approaches]] can be embedded within climate mitigation strategies to address global climate targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Public Sector Innovation Observatory, in collaboration with the Mission Action Lab, analyzed the climate mitigation reports of 15 countries to identify gaps and ways to strengthen these efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Current Landscape and Challenges

### Economic and Political Challenges
While clean energy markets have expanded significantly, driven by government policies and market forces, and global investment in renewables and low-carbon technologies reached $2 trillion USD last year—double the amount spent on fossil fuels—the momentum for climate action is at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
The pace of climate policy adoption and strengthening has slowed from 10% annually to 1-2% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This slowdown is attributed to:
*   Slower global growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   Multiple geopolitical tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   Rising public debt straining government budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   Shifting government priorities and changes in administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Pushback from sectors like agriculture in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   Perception that climate action reduces economic opportunities or that the net-zero transition is not investable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

However, a joint OECD-UNDP report, "Investing in Climate for Growth and Development," presents evidence that stronger climate action provides an economic boost, projecting a net gain of 0.2% in global GDP by 2040, potentially reaching up to 13% of GDP growth by 2100 when accounting for avoided climate damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Achieving this requires climate policies to be integrated across core government ministries, aligned with national development strategies, and engage the private sector early to ensure policy certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Strengthening financial institutions and ensuring a people-centered just transition are also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Innovation Challenges
Innovation has driven significant progress in the past 20 years, with prices of batteries, solar, and wind power decreasing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that about 35% of the necessary CO2 emission reductions by 2050 will come from technologies not yet commercially available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Investment in green startups has also increased significantly since the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

However, the current pace of innovation is insufficient to meet carbon neutrality goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Climate-related patent filings have decreased as a share of all patenting over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Efforts are currently focusing on incremental innovation and the deployment of existing technologies rather than R&D for entirely new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Innovation needs to be combined with complementary changes in skills, infrastructure, regulations, and mobility patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. [[missionoriented_policies_for_net_zero | Mission-oriented approaches]] are essential for integrating innovation policies into broader climate commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Governance and Policy Challenges
The International Climate Council's Network (ICCN), comprising various [[role_of_climate_councils_in_policy_implementation | climate councils]] globally, advises governments and parliaments on climate policies, grounded in scientific evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Key challenges include:
*   **Polarization of Climate Change**: Climate change is increasingly politicized, hindering decarbonization progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Hard-to-Abate Sectors**: While progress has been made in decarbonizing power, less has been done in sectors like agriculture and food, where a large disconnect exists between action and IPCC-identified potential for emissions reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Weak Governance**: Inadequate governmental channels often prevent climate policy from being informed by science or engaging the public and stakeholders effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. [[role_of_climate_councils_in_policy_implementation | Climate councils]] can bridge this gap and contribute to a strong climate framework law with accountability mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Short Time Horizons of Government Policy**: Short election cycles lead to policy flip-flops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. [[role_of_climate_councils_in_policy_implementation | Climate councils]] help ensure consistent policy across long time horizons, remaining politically neutral and evidence-rooted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

## The Role of Mission Governance

[[Mission governance]] is a powerful tool to [[addressing_climate_change | address climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. It establishes clear, measurable objectives that integrate climate commitments into government strategic planning, ensuring prioritization, guiding resource allocation, and strengthening cross-sectoral coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>.

Key aspects of [[mission governance]]:
*   **Cross-Sectoral Coordination**: Instead of working in silos, ministries and agencies align around defined climate missions. The UK's dedicated cabinet committee on climate change, chaired by the prime minister, ensures unified action and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>.
*   **Capability Building**: It emphasizes strengthening public officials' and institutions' capabilities, as climate strategies require technical expertise and adaptive policymaking. Sweden's Impact Innovation Programs include an accelerator function to build public sector capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: It integrates robust data and continuous learning. Governments can measure progress, understand impacts, and adapt policies through evaluation, experimentation, and iterative learning. Denmark's "innomissions" explicitly integrate experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.
*   **Stronger Stakeholder Engagement**: It promotes transparency and equity. Engagement with diverse stakeholders—business, civil society, local communities, citizens—is vital for legitimacy and long-term success. New Zealand's Climate Change Commission has prioritized improving stakeholder engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>.

[[Mission governance]] can greatly help focus on net zero delivery in member countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>. It requires sustained political engagement and support, especially given the polarization of climate issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. It can help build trust in institutions by grounding efforts in credibility and evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.

### Key [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_green_governance | Challenges and Opportunities in Green Governance]]
A core challenge is the perception that climate policy is solely the responsibility of "climate people" rather than a cross-cutting, whole-of-government endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a>. Other challenges include:
*   **Lack of Collaboration**: Many governments are not equipped for the "radical collaboration" needed for systemic change across multiple implicated agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:16">[01:23:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.
*   **Insufficient Public Engagement**: Public consultation is often inadequate, leading to backlash and negative impacts on vulnerable communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:18">[01:24:18]</a>.
*   **Capacity Constraints**: Local-level capacity constraints, narrow KPIs, and siloed budgets hinder collaboration and can lead to contradictory actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>. For example, focusing only on electric vehicles might not solve traffic congestion if public transport and active mobility are neglected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>.

**Opportunities**: A [[missionoriented policies for net zero | mission-oriented approach]] can help design transformative policy packages, building on insights from systems thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:17">[01:26:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:02">[01:27:02]</a>. These packages can lead to more effective policies and create synergies between emissions reduction efforts and co-benefits like improved health, safety, and equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. The OECD Environment Directorate is joining the Mission Action Lab to build evidence on using mission approaches in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>.

## Integrating Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) with Climate Goals

### Evolution of Missions
Early missions (e.g., Moon projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:17">[01:18:17]</a>, Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:42">[01:28:42]</a>) focused on scientific and technological breakthroughs in defense and space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:49">[01:28:49]</a>. Today's missions require fundamentally different approaches, driving systemic transformations across entire socio-technical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Developing new technologies and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>.
*   Enhancing skills to produce or operate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:16">[01:29:16]</a>.
*   Building associated infrastructures (e.g., electric vehicles, hydrogen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a>.
*   Shaping user behaviors and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:27">[01:29:27]</a>.
*   Adapting business models (e.g., towards circular economy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>.
*   Transforming regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>.

Achieving this requires aligning STI policies with other policy areas like education, agriculture, transport, water, and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>. Despite decades of efforts to break down silos between research, industry, and authorities, more coordination is needed to meet climate goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:48">[01:29:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

### Bridging the "STI Trap"
While [[missionoriented_policies_for_net_zero | mission-oriented policies for net zero]] show marked improvement over traditional STI policies by fostering ambitious cross-sectoral collaboration, their current form is insufficient to scale and deploy solutions at the magnitude needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:23">[01:31:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a>. This is due to an "STI trap," where missions, though aiming for systemic change, are still predominantly led by STI authorities and rely on STI instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:13">[01:35:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>. There's a mismatch between the mission's goal (theory of change) and the types of instruments and funding mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:44">[01:35:44]</a>. Missions need access to a broader policy mix, including regulatory changes, skill development, economic incentives, and scale-up support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>.

### Scenarios for Mission Implementation
To transition from innovation missions to truly transformative missions, several scenarios are observed:
1.  **Gradual Broadening and Strengthening**: Missions learn and broaden their scope, integrating better over time to become transition missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>.
2.  **Transfer of Mission Leadership**: Leadership shifts from STI authorities to challenge owners (e.g., climate, environment, transport ministries). This can be sensitive due to political turf and budget competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>.
3.  **Dedicated Mission Agencies**: Missions are led by dedicated agencies reporting to several ministries. For example, Norway's research council reports to over 15 different ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>.
4.  **Elevating Missions**: Missions are led by central government bodies like the prime minister's office or powerful transition committees, directly linking to broader climate agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:12">[01:39:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:20">[01:39:20]</a>.
5.  **Regional/Local Missions**: Operating missions at a smaller, regional or local scale can alleviate [[governance_structures_and_policy_coordination_in_missions | governance challenges and policy coordination in missions]] and ensure stronger private stakeholder engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:25">[01:40:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:37">[01:40:37]</a>.

## Role of Centers of Government and Climate Councils

### Central Government's Role
Centers of government have become more important in addressing complex, intertwined policy issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:39">[01:33:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:41">[01:33:41]</a>.
*   About 90% of OECD centers of government now prioritize key objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:56">[01:33:56]</a>.
*   Over half mandate line departments to develop strategic plans in cross-cutting areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:13">[01:34:13]</a>.
*   About 70% report increased coordination activities, and 80% report increased responsibilities since 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:24">[01:34:24]</a>.

They are well-positioned to champion integrated policies, leverage convening power to align sectoral actions, and connect technical missions with cabinet-level political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>. This is particularly important for climate action, as environment ministers often do not rank highly in cabinet systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:06">[01:35:06]</a>.

### Climate Councils' Role in Practice
[[Role of climate councils in policy implementation | Climate councils]] can play a supporting role, depending on their remit and wider [[governance_structures_and_policy_coordination_in_missions | governance structures and policy coordination in missions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. Anchoring missions in a high-level body at the center of government is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
*   **South Africa**: The Presidential Climate Change Commission is chaired by the president, established before the climate change act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>. This placement aims to prevent climate policy from being seen as solely an environmental issue and to ensure broad alignment across government departments and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. It enables a systematic, cross-sectoral approach to interconnected climate challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>.
*   **Ireland**: The Climate Change Advisory Council contributes to clear objectives for national climate efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>. Visible political leadership and ministry engagement are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>.
*   **Denmark**: The Innovation Fund Denmark invests in four green mission partnerships ("innomissions") focused on strategic research and innovation in areas like carbon capture, green fuels, climate-friendly agriculture, and circular economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>. These missions combine climate action with economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>. While politically established, they are primarily anchored in the funding agency, leading to a weaker direct link to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:34">[01:30:34]</a>. They gather diverse ecosystem actors, but balancing partner commitment with clear directionality can be challenging due to private interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:16">[01:32:16]</a>.

## Report Findings and Recommendations

The report assesses how current [[governance_structures_and_policy_coordination_in_missions | governance structures and policy coordination in missions]] align with mission-oriented outcomes for national climate targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>. Despite various policy instruments and commitments, many countries are not on track to meet Paris Agreement targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.

### Key Findings and Gaps
*   **Specific Missions**: Only a few countries have specific, targeted, ambitious, and time-bound climate targets that can be truly called missions (e.g., Norway's "all feed from farmed fisheries shall come from sustainable sources") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. Broad "net-zero economy" missions can be paralyzing; specific sectoral missions are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **Mission Governance Framework**: An effective [[mission governance]] framework is crucial for whole-of-government action, starting from national targets down to sectoral missions and [[missionoriented_policies_for_net_zero | mission-oriented innovation policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.
*   **Strengths in Current Frameworks**: Climate mitigation frameworks often excel in framework anchoring (legal and institutional arrangements like the UK Climate Change Act or New Zealand's Climate Change Response) and direction setting (roadmaps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. They also tend to have access to broad policy mixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.
*   **Areas of Lag**: Significant gaps exist in:
    *   **Mission Management**: Lack of dedicated mission management teams or secretariats means shared responsibility for complex, cross-sectoral challenges disappears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.
    *   **Sustained Political Support**: While some countries like Canada and Sweden show signs of designing mechanisms to tackle political support issues across electoral cycles, this remains problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
    *   **Societal Engagement**: While dialogue mechanisms exist, public participation is not broadly utilized across climate mitigation plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.
    *   **Mobilization of External Actors**: Systematic mobilization of communities, the private sector, and non-profits is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.
    *   **Private Investment**: Crowding in private investment systematically and coherently is difficult due to the need for investor confidence and market shaping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
    *   **Experimentation and Process Integration**: These are among the most lagging areas, with experimentation rarely mentioned in climate mitigation reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.

### Recommendations for [[mission_setting_and_policy_making | Mission-Oriented Climate Action]]
The report strongly advocates for integrating [[mission governance]] principles into national climate efforts to make them systematic and concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
*   Develop targeted missions for specific sub-targets with clear commitments and timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>.
*   Enable and strengthen political support and societal engagement to avoid relying on crisis-driven momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.
*   Enhance innovation and experimentation in climate policy and integrate them into current actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>.

This report serves as a starting point for further discussion and cross-learning on how to apply and expand [[missionoriented_policies_for_net_zero | mission-oriented policies]] to achieve climate goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:56">[01:41:56]</a>. The Mission Action Lab's community of practice aims to support the practical implementation of these missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:09">[01:43:09]</a>.

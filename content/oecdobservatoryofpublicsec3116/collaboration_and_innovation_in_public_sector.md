The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) focuses on developing tools, methods, and capabilities for [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] within government organizations. A key area of their work involves "portfolio exploration" and its applications in diverse settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This approach helps organizations understand and manage their range of innovation activities.

## The Portfolio Exploration Tool

OPSI has developed a self-service tool based on theoretical concepts to help organizations analyze their innovation context and visualize their innovation portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### Understanding Innovation Types

Pirette, from OPSI, highlights that organizations naturally have "innovation portfolios" even if they aren't formally acknowledged or managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. OPSI uses an "innovation facets model" to categorize innovation by its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>:
*   **Mission-oriented innovation**: Aims to achieve specific, agreed-upon goals, often top-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation**: Focuses on improving existing systems to be more effective, efficient, or reach more people, often driven by high certainty and existing drivers like austerity or increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation**: Responds to new ideas and evolving situations from the system itself, requiring open space for creativity and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation**: Prepares for new risks, uncertainties, and future developments, operating in areas of high uncertainty and often critical to strategic goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Principles of Innovation Portfolio Management

Effective innovation portfolio management requires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>:
*   **Sense-making**: Understanding the types of innovations an organization is working on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Stewardship**: Someone assigned to make sense of information and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Supportive Structures**: Allowing different types of innovation to coexist and connecting synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Resource Allocation**: Questioning how different innovations are resourced, monitored, and evaluated across the entire portfolio, not just individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Learning and Communication**: Managing learning within and about the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

A "balanced" portfolio does not imply an equal number of projects or funding across all innovation types. Instead, it means consciously stewarding different types of innovation towards the specific aims of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. For example, a caregiving organization might have a highly adaptive portfolio, while a space agency might be more anticipatory or mission-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. The key is to connect strategic aims to the innovation portfolio and avoid being "locked in" to one type of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Tool Offerings and Benefits
The tool provides:
*   **Individualized Guidance**: Showing strengths and recommending actions based on results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Management Capability Score**: Assessing the strength of factors important for managing a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Project-Based Mapping**: Reverse engineering an organization's overall portfolio based on current projects and activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

The tool provides tailored results and guidance, and also collects anonymized aggregate data, offering a continuously updated global picture of innovation trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. It supports different levels of analysis – individual, team, or senior management – to understand current practices, spark conversations, and align efforts with strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

## Case Studies: Real-World Application

### Natural Resources Wales (NRW)

Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is a young public body, formed in 2013, with sustainable development enshrined in Welsh legislation through the Environment Act and the Well-being of Future Generations Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This places a statutory duty on public bodies to work [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaboratively]] and collectively for future generations and environmental management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

#### Challenges and Motivation for Innovation
NRW faces significant environmental challenges, including the climate emergency and nature crisis, which require innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. They must balance these needs with statutory responsibilities like regulation and enforcement, which demand risk-averse approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

#### Using the Portfolio Exploration Tool
Luke Megs and Holly Butterworth from NRW were tasked with coordinating the organization's informal approach to [[innovation in public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. The tool provided a "robust approach and framework" to begin portfolio development, crystallizing discussions and widening conversations beyond small groups of innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.

#### Insights and Outcomes
*   **Portfolio Balance**: NRW found they were strong in "enhancement" innovation, which is natural for a public sector body with highly specialized staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. However, they identified a need to be stronger in the "anticipatory" space to address radical solutions for climate change and nature collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.
*   **Challenges in Practice**: NRW's experience with an "innovation fund" revealed how traditional public service approaches (transparency, clear decision-making) can hinder true experimentation and the progression of more innovative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. The tool helped highlight systemic barriers and the importance of "selling the idea" of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Management Capability**: NRW has a small, interdisciplinary team with specialists in futures, innovation, risk, and evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>. Their challenge is scaling this support and protecting the specialists' capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>. They consider "culture, capability, and capacity" when thinking about innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.
*   **Synergies**: The tool helps understand where innovation is happening and opens conversations to identify synergies between projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. It also prompts organizations to look at existing projects through different innovation lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.

### City of Lund, Sweden

Katarina Scott from the City of Lund, Sweden, works with an [[innovation in public sector | innovation]] platform initiated by the Swedish Innovation Ministry to push innovation down to the city level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. Lund is a university city with a history of innovation, making it a natural "testbed" for early-stage developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

#### Challenges and Motivation for Innovation
As a city composed of many departments, Lund faces the challenge of managing an "explosion" of innovation activities driven by new research facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. They need to learn how a city authority, typically focused on stable service delivery (e.g., streets, healthcare), can effectively use innovation and [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaborate]] with external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

#### Using the Portfolio Exploration Tool
The tool helped the City of Lund structure their thoughts and discussions, moving from random activities to a more strategic "portfolio thinking" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. It allowed them to combine their efforts with other models like multi-stakeholder governance and innovation theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>.

#### Insights and Outcomes
*   **Portfolio Balance**: Lund found that "enhancement" and "anticipatory" areas were often not considered "innovations" within their organization and lacked specific goals or resources, despite being where much of the city's work happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. Mission-oriented goals (e.g., climate neutrality) received political attention but lacked proper placement within the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Management Capability**: Lund emphasizes that portfolio management in the public sector is not merely a process management system but a "people relational orientated system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>. It requires:
    *   Combining systematic approaches with fostering human relationships.
    *   Finding "champions" who will drive innovation despite challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>.
    *   A neutral facilitator to negotiate between different areas and external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>.
    *   Patience for long-term development (e.g., a three-year project to implement electric charging for heavy traffic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.
    *   A positive, "strength-based" approach, focusing on successes and good outcomes rather than problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
*   **Synergies**: Visualizing different innovation areas helps reveal where they fit together and facilitates discussions about how to hand over projects for upscaling or determine suitable partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>. The tool provides a concrete "starting point" for discussions and partnerships, preventing endless ideation and policy paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

The OPSI Portfolio Exploration tool, while just a tool, forces overdue conversations and helps organizations to:
*   Identify strengths and weaknesses in their innovation portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.
*   Visualize projects and understand their classification by purpose (mission-oriented, enhancement, adaptive, anticipatory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:08">[01:17:08]</a>.
*   Discover synergies and discords between projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>.
*   Reflect on their organizational context, including procurement and human resource planning, and how it influences innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.
*   Promote cross-team and cross-organizational [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_sector_innovation | collaboration]] by providing a common framework for discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   Understand the importance of dedicated time and space for portfolio management activities and stewardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>.
*   Recognize that a "successful" portfolio doesn't mean a 100% success rate for individual innovations, as failure is a natural part of risk-taking in innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.

The tool provides the foundation, but dedicated organizations and a willingness to engage in complex, sometimes political, discussions are crucial for truly impactful [[collaborative_approaches_in_public_sector_innovation | innovation in the public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.

### Getting Involved

The Portfolio Exploration Tool will be formally launched at the "Government After Shock" event in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. Organizations can sign up to host their own self-organized strategy sessions using the tool and a provided kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:36">[01:21:36]</a>. These sessions encourage reflection on what practices to leave behind, keep, and change in response to major shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>.

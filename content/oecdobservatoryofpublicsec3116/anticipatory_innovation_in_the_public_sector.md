The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) hosts webinars focusing on getting started with [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This work provides context on what [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] entails, discusses efforts with countries like Portugal to develop an [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] starter kit, and explores strategies to overcome initial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This also informs the development of an international version of the starter kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## What is Anticipatory Innovation?

[[Anticipatory Innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] is a key facet of OPSI's multi-faceted innovation model, designed to guide the purpose of different types of [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation in the public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It is an area that tends to be systematically under-invested in, prompting OPSI to dedicate additional energy to building this [[public_sector_capacity_for_anticipatory_innovation | capacity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

The distinction between [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipation]], [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]], and [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. It's not enough to merely anticipate or innovate; it also involves implementing mechanisms and structures within governments to ensure this work can happen sustainably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Current Landscape and Drivers for Anticipatory Innovation

### Denmark
Denmark has a long history of [[Public Sector Innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. Surveys indicate that eight out of ten public sector workplaces have implemented an innovation in the last two years, with nine out of ten connected to core activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. This strong foundation, however, can lead to complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. While strong in enhancement and [[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | adaptive innovation in public services]], [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory]] and mission-oriented innovation are areas of weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. There is a need to continuously develop the system, build on strengths, and invest in learning and the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. Complex challenges like climate change and demographic shifts inherently require a future-oriented approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

### Chile
Chile recently established a Ministry of Science less than two years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Its first national policy in science, technology, and innovation, published in October 2020, designated [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] as a central area, specifically the "future axis of the polity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Various initiatives exist across public sector organizations, but they are not yet organized as a system, leading to a lack of political agreement, sufficient funding, and multidisciplinary technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. Less than 20% of public funding for science, knowledge, technology, and innovation is invested in facing the future in an organized way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. The Ministry aims to coordinate [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] efforts and build this [[public_sector_capacity_for_anticipatory_innovation | capacity]] within the Chilean state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

### Slovenia
Slovenia is conducting a study on age and talent management with the OECD, addressing demographic changes. By 2050, 33% of the Slovenian population is projected to be over 65, necessitating an increase in retirement age and an efficient talent management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>. This demographic shift provides an ideal case for applying an [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory approach]], looking into the future to find different options and give time and space for thinking about future possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. Through workshops, different administrations are identifying and ranking future changes and prototyping innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

### Portugal: The Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit
Portugal, through LabX, is incubating an [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] starter kit in collaboration with the OECD and the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The goal is to translate abstract concepts into concrete actions to address real needs in public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

**Problem Identification:**
LabX identified four major issues from the perspective of potential users (public managers and experts):
1.  **Unease with future uncertainty:** People either avoid thinking about it or try to repress it through prescriptions, creating an idealized future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
2.  **Sense of urgency:** Public managers are constantly dealing with day-to-day issues, making it difficult to grasp future horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
3.  **Reliance on past routines:** This can perpetuate solutions that are no longer effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
4.  **Helplessness:** Managers feel alone when trying to apply foresight and new trends in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
5.  **Feeble interest and skills:** There is a lack of awareness and accessibility, limiting demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

**Design Principles for the Starter Kit:**
The kit aims to solve these problems by:
*   **Solving real problems:** Translating problems into challenges and providing tools without creating new dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **User-friendly:** Designed for beginners (public managers and servants) who have heard about foresight but need practical guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. It should support a "do-it-yourself" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Actionable and adaptable:** It should be modular and recontextualizable, producing tangible changes and bringing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

**Starter Kit Structure:**
The kit focuses on turning identified problems into challenges across four main areas:
1.  **Producing/Imagining alternative futures** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>
2.  **Envisioning a new vision** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>
3.  **Setting a strategy** to attain goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>
4.  **Understanding drivers of change** that permeate the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>
Each area offers different tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. The incubator program allows this architecture to be stress-tested and improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Main Barriers to Getting Started with Anticipatory Innovation

OPSI categorizes barriers into five broad areas, contributing to an "impact gap" where excellent foresight work isn't implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>:
1.  **Competency Barriers:** Strategic foresight is not systematically embedded across governments; it often exists only in pockets of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
2.  **Cultural Barriers:** Unreasonable expectations that foresight will reveal the future like an oracle, leading to reliance on experts for absolute predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.
3.  **Cognitive Barriers:** Difficulty with concepts like complexity, uncertainty, and exponentiality, leading to avoidance of uncertainty, groupthink, recency bias, and a lack of imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
4.  **Corporate Barriers:** Organizations often hold onto implicit, outdated versions of the future ("zombie futures"), preventing adaptation to fast-changing realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
5.  **Communication Barriers:** Different perceptions of the future within an organization, where implicit disagreements are not constructively managed, leading to surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.

## Needs of Civil Servants and Toolkit Functions

Civil servants wishing to embrace [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] need support and tools that address these barriers. Key characteristics and needs include:
*   **Motivation and soft skills:** Essential for collaboration and co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.
*   **Learning by doing:** Concrete cases provide the best way to engage civil servants with new practices and prove value to leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.
*   **Funding and expert support:** Dedicated resources for training and expert help are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
*   **Open and shared scenarios:** Offering future scenarios as a public good allows politicians, the productive sector, and academia to respond based on their values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>.
*   **Questioning and learning process:** A toolkit should be a platform for asking questions, not just providing answers, starting a process of continuous learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.
*   **Modularity and adaptability:** The kit should be a modular solution that can be upgraded or adapted to specific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.

A toolkit, while not a panacea, can be a valuable option among others, especially when there's a pressing need for immediately reachable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>. It should specifically target beginners in public management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. It aims to socialize skills like imagination, boldness, and prospection, which are critical for the future of public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>. The goal is to stimulate people to explore the future, providing a way to approach new horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>.

## Limitations of Toolkits and Anticipatory Work

*   **Not a panacea:** An [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] starter kit does not guarantee benefits and its effectiveness depends on its construction and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.
*   **Action is key:** Anticipation and strategic foresight do not solve problems on their own; they must lead to action and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.
*   **Incomplete picture:** They enlarge but never fully complete the picture of relevant considerations for decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Long-term effort:** They require sustained effort over long periods to bear fruit; breakthroughs are unlikely in a single exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.
*   **Risk of unhelpful implementation:** Some processes involve excessive gathering and pondering over signals, neglecting relevant selection, purpose-driven sense-making, and generation of ideas for concrete innovation and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

## Role of Politics and Values

A significant question in [[Anticipatory Innovation and Public Sector | anticipatory innovation and public sector]] work is how to incorporate values and engage politicians, especially since innovation affects public values, and [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipation]] involves high uncertainty in shaping the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Political cycles are short (3-5 years), while the problems faced often have much longer time scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>.

There is a need for forums to discuss trade-offs and values, including those of future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>. Politicians are crucial for agreeing on which future scenarios represent opportunities and which are risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. There is often a competition between non-linear (foresight) and linear (economic) thinking in politics, with the latter often dominating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>. The challenge for foresight practitioners is to introduce this less linear, more value-driven way of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.

Despite challenges like changing governments and politicians' desire for quick results, motivation, stubbornness, and proving the value of [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory approaches]] through implementation are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>. Communication of results and continuous effort are necessary to foster a new culture where society co-creates transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>.

## OPSI's Future Work

OPSI continues to support LabX Portugal's incubator project for their [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] starter kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>. In parallel, OPSI is collaborating with the Danish Design Center on an international version of the [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] starter kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>. This work learns from experimental approaches to create a valuable pool of resources for those seeking to get started with [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] and strategic foresight in the public sector globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. OPSI's framework of [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] emphasizes the need for an authorizing environment and agency to favor the practice of strategic foresight and [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] within governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>.

From: [[oecdobservatoryofpublicsec3116]] <br/> 

[[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] is a key facet of [[innovation in the public sector | public sector innovation]] that tends to be systematically under-invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) is dedicating additional energy to building up this capacity within governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>.

## OECD's Approach to Innovation

OPSI utilizes a multi-faceted [[innovation in the public sector | innovation model]] to guide the purpose of different types of [[types_and_purposes_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation in the public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25">[01:42:25]</a>.

### Anticipatory Innovation vs. Anticipatory Innovation Governance

It is not enough to anticipate or to innovate; it is also crucial to establish mechanisms and structures within governments to enable this work to happen sustainably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This distinction between [[anticipatory_innovation]] and [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] is constantly discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:01">[02:20:01]</a>.

[[Anticipatory Innovation Governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] mechanisms focus on creating an authorizing environment and agency for performing [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:09">[02:59:09]</a>.

### Research and Development

OPSI's work is conducted through cases and action research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:56">[03:29:56]</a>. As [[anticipatory_innovation]] is systematically under-invested in governments, OPSI collaborates with governments to build up this capacity and learn what it takes to implement this work effectively in practice, moving beyond mere theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. A key aspect is discussing what it actually takes to get started, transforming good intentions into action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

More information on OPSI's work can be found in their published papers, including a short and long version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## The Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit

OPSI is developing an [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] starter kit through collaborations with various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

### Collaboration with Portugal (LabX)

OPSI is working closely with LabX Portugal to incubate an [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] starter kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. This incubator program is a collaboration with the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme, providing support and constructive criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. The aim is to set a practical approach to [[anticipatory_innovation]], translating concepts into actions that address a real need in public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

#### Understanding the Problem

LabX began by crowdsourcing problems from the standpoint of potential users, not just experts or internal expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. They involved experts and public managers through events like the Government Aftershock conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

Four major issues were detected among public managers in Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>:
1.  **Uneasiness with Future Uncertainty:** People are uncomfortable dealing with uncertainty, either avoiding it or trying to repress it through prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
2.  **Sense of Urgency:** Public managers are constantly dealing with day-to-day issues, making it difficult to grasp future horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
3.  **Reliance on Past Routines:** Relying on past successful routines and habits can perpetuate solutions that are no longer effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
4.  **Helplessness with Futures Work:** Managers feel alone when trying to apply foresight or new trends in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. There is a "feeble interest and mostly civil skills" among upcoming practitioners because they haven't experienced the value of these approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

#### Design Principles for the Starter Kit

Workshops helped settle on basic design principles for the [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] starter kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>:
*   **Problem-solving:** It must solve real problems, translating them into challenges and providing tools without creating new dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
*   **User-friendly:** Designed for non-experts, supporting a "do-it-yourself" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.
*   **Actionable and Adaptable:** Not a mere replication, but something that can be recontextualized, adapted to specific needs, and produces real changes and value on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

#### Structure of the Starter Kit

The starter kit has three main areas, starting with problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. It helps users translate problems into challenges, which could involve:
*   Imagining alternative futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.
*   Envisioning a new origin or desired vision for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.
*   Setting a concrete strategy to attain certain goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.
*   Understanding the drivers of change surrounding their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

Each area of challenge has different tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. The incubator program will stress-test this architecture for improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.

#### Incubation Program Goals

The basic goals for the incubation program include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>:
*   **Raising awareness and generating interest:** To make [[anticipatory_innovation]] part of people's arsenal and range of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.
*   **Engaging users in practical tasks:** To bridge the gap between knowledge and action in [[anticipatory_innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.
*   **Adopting an experimental approach:** To test the starter kit, learn from attrition, and develop a better version for dissemination in Portugal and as a pilot for an international version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>.

### International Version

In parallel, OPSI is working with the Danish Design Center on a more international version of the [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] starter kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. The incubator project with Portugal is important for learning lessons from the experimental approach to apply broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. This aims to provide a valuable pool of resources for people worldwide seeking to get started with [[anticipatory_innovation]] and strategic foresight in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

## Barriers to Getting Started with Anticipatory Innovation

Several countries face challenges in implementing [[anticipatory_innovation]] and strategic foresight.

### The Five C's of Barriers (OPSI Framework)

OPSI has identified five broad areas of barriers, termed the "Five C's," which contribute to an "impact gap" where excellent futures thinking fails to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>:

1.  **Competency Barriers:** Strategic foresight practice is not universally seen across governments; it often exists in pockets of excellence but is not systematically embedded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Cultural Barriers:** These include unreasonable expectations that strategic foresight will act like an oracle to reveal the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
3.  **Cognitive Barriers:** These are cognitive distortions related to the future, such as difficulty with complexity, uncertainty, and exponentiality, leading to avoidance of uncertainty, groupthink, recency/availability bias, and a lack of imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
4.  **Corporate Barriers:** Organizations can have an implicit sense of the future that lingers too long and becomes irrelevant ("zombie futures"), hindering their ability to keep up with disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
5.  **Communication Barriers:** Different perceptions of the future within an organization, while offering diversity, can lead to trouble if not explicitly addressed, potentially causing surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Strategic foresight can help bring people together around shared narratives or constructive disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

### Country-Specific Challenges

*   **Chile:** The Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge, and Innovation, established less than two years ago, has made [[anticipatory_innovation]] a central area of its national policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. However, existing initiatives across public sector organizations are not yet organized as a system of [[anticipatory_innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. They lack the ability to generate sufficient political agreement, secure necessary funding, or attract the multidisciplinary technical skills required to face future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Less than 20% of public funding for science, knowledge, technology, and [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] is invested in an organized way of facing the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **Denmark:** Denmark has a long history of [[innovation in the public sector | public sector innovation]], with 8 out of 10 public sector workplaces implementing [[innovation in the public sector | innovations]] in the last two years, mostly connected to core activities and very bottom-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. While strong in enhancement and [[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | adaptive innovation]], [[anticipatory_innovation]] and mission-oriented innovation are weak spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The existing "solid foundation" can lead to complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Slovenia:** Slovenia is learning by doing, evolving step-by-step without a fully established system for [[anticipatory_innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. A key trigger for their interest is the demographic change, with projections of 33% of the Slovenian population being over 65 by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of looking into the future and coping with modern society's rapidly changing requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Challenges include the need for funding and dedicated training, gaining leadership buy-in (which can fluctuate with changes in government), and encouraging civil servant motivation and soft skills for collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

## Needs of Civil Servants and Toolkit Design

Civil servants who want to embrace [[anticipatory_innovation]] need support to address existing barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

### Characteristics of Needed Support

Civil servants need to be able to build multidisciplinary and collaborative answers, recognizing that future scenarios are agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. They need to be able to generate political agreements and secure funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Features of an Effective Toolkit

A toolkit should:
*   **Be developed with users:** Engaging users in the development process is paramount to ensure relevance and actual use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.
*   **Add tangible value:** It needs to be concrete and practical, answering the question "How is this helping me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Connect to other approaches:** It should clarify how it connects to other tools, toolkits, and ways of working with [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. Users need to understand when it's the right toolkit to use and when something else is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Address specific audience segments:** For instance, the Portuguese starter kit targets beginners in public management who have heard about foresight but need practical guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   **Socialize skills:** It should stimulate abilities like imagination, boldness, and prospection, which are critical for the future of public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### Limitations of a Toolkit

A toolkit is an option among others, dependent on context and detected needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Not a solution provider:** It is a platform for asking questions, not for providing definitive answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   **Starts a process, not a final solution:** It initiates a learning-by-doing process for capacity building, which requires sustained effort over long periods to bear fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   **Not prescriptive:** It should be a modular and adaptable solution, allowing users to upgrade or leave aside parts as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Doesn't solve problems inherently:** [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipation]] and strategic foresight enlarge the picture but can never complete it. They must lead to action, strategy, and implementation to serve a real purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Can be implemented unhelpfully:** Excessive gathering and pondering over signals of future change at the expense of relevant selection, sense-making, strategic reframing, and idea generation for concrete innovation is not considered successful [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

## The Political Dimension and Values

Working with [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]], especially [[anticipatory_innovation]], inherently involves affecting public values and dealing with high uncertainty about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

Key questions include:
*   How to incorporate values explicitly into the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   How to integrate this into legislative proposals and new spaces where such discussions don't already exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   Addressing the discrepancy between short political cycles (3-5 years) and longer timescales of societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   The role of politicians in defining desired futures and making value-based decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

In Chile, there is a clear understanding that everyone in any position is a political actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The community has agreed on the requirement for a spectrum of possible future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. The political aspect, including values, comes into play when deciding which portions of these scenarios are considered opportunities and which are risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. There is a need for politicians to help society agree on these questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

One important aspect is to offer these scenarios as a public good, similar to open-source code, so that politicians, the productive sector, and academia can use their values and perspectives to respond to the spectrum of scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. There's a challenge for foresight practitioners to introduce a less linear way of thinking about the future, moving beyond the current dominance of economic discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

Civil servants must be motivated and stubborn in proving the value of new approaches, like [[anticipatory_innovation]], through concrete implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This helps spread a new culture where society co-creates transparently, despite political tendencies to avoid transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. While data and collaboration exist, the challenge lies in decision-making and transparency about those decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

The excitement generated around [[anticipatory_innovation]] and futures thinking is a crucial asset, especially when the work begins to create discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. While uncertainty and intangibility are inherent, practical aspects include getting support, senior buy-in from politicians and leadership, securing funding, and asking many questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. These elements relate to OPSI's framework of [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance | authorizing environment]] and agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

OPSI will continue supporting LabX Portugal with their incubator project for the [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] starter kit and will proceed with their own international version in collaboration with the Danish Design Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. More information on OPSI's work on [[anticipatory_innovation]] and other facets of [[innovation in the public sector | public sector innovation]] is available on their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

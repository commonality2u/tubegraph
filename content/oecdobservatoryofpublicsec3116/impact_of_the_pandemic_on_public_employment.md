The COVID-19 pandemic, alongside other crises like the Australian bushfires, has profoundly [[impact_of_global_crises_on_public_policy | impacted global public policy]] and understanding of public service, revealing both challenges and opportunities for the future of public employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Shifting Understanding of Public Service

The crisis has significantly shifted the perception and expectations of government and public employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Reputation and Stereotypes
In Slovenia, the reputation of the civil service increased significantly because it provided anti-coronal law packages rapidly and ensured the functioning of critical infrastructures and support for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The civil service also broke down the stereotype of being rigid and slow to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Similarly, in Australia, the critical role of the public service in meeting community needs was brought into sharp focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Public employees were recognized as essential workers, not just bureaucrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### Agility and Responsiveness
Public administration demonstrated agility and responsiveness during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. In Slovenia, nearly 70% of civil servants shifted to remote work practically overnight, a move unimaginable a month prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Many found their engagement, efficiency, and satisfaction higher while teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Enhanced Collaboration
A strong theme has been the significant increase in cross-collaboration between agencies, government departments, and even voluntary groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The Australian public service worked closely as "one APS" (Australian Public Service), rallying and coming together effectively in crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This collaboration, often difficult in large organizations with competing priorities, was facilitated by the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## Developing Resilience and Future Skills

To further develop resilience in public workforces, several key areas have been identified:

*   **Digital Technologies and Skills:** Efficient use of digital technologies in the public sector is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. The crisis accelerated the need for a [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_transformation_in_the_public_sector | more digitally savvy public sector workforce]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>. Foundational skills in digital and data are a key focus for the Australian Public Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.
*   **Learning Organizations:** The civil service should become a learning organization, investing in people's skills rather than just tools and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This means continuous learning and adaptation, as digital technologies will radically change public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Critical "Soft" Skills:** Skills such as critical thinking, creativity, judgment, responsiveness, innovation, and especially the ability to continuously learn and adapt, are becoming more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Emotional intelligence and good judgment to solve problems and collaborate are also vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.
*   **Intergenerational Cooperation:** To ensure no one is left behind due to a lack of digital skills, promoting coaching and mentorship between younger (often more digitally adept) and older civil servants is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
*   **Distributed Leadership and Wellness:** There is a need to build middle management teams and support distributed leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Leaders must be visible and address the mental well-being and wellness of staff, who are juggling work with personal responsibilities and the fear of the unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   **Risk Management:** Public servants have shown they can respond very quickly, challenging the stereotype of being risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. Managing the risk appetite of organizations is an ongoing consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

## Rethinking Public Employment: Opportunities and Risks

The crisis presents a significant opportunity to rethink public employment, but also carries risks that need careful management.

### Opportunities
*   **Balanced Remote Work:** The shift to remote work can be efficient for the civil service, but a balanced approach combining remote and office work is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>. The Australian Public Service is exploring "public service hubs" closer to where people live, allowing for connection without daily long commutes to city centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>. Ireland is also developing a remote working policy and rolling out similar working hubs across rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.
*   **Workforce Mobility and Surge Reserve:** The crisis demonstrated the effectiveness of mobilizing workforces where needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. The Australian Public Service is building a "surge reserve" of pre-nominated and skilled personnel ready for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.
*   **Investment in Public Services:** Decades of cuts, understaffing, and high turnover have failed, as evidenced during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. There is a need for political will to invest in public services and administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **Professionalization and Leadership:** There is an opportunity to grow specialist roles (e.g., HR, project management, cyber security) while retaining generalists with "wise counsel" for interface between political and administrative structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. Leaders need strong crisis management skills and the ability to build trust and communicate effectively with remote teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.

### Risks and Pitfalls to Avoid
*   **Work-Life Balance and Burnout:** Remote work brings risks like burnout and challenges to work-life balance, especially for those juggling childcare or other domestic responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.
*   **Political Interference and Competition:** Emergencies should not be used as a political tool for competition among parties or different levels of government, as this impacts the effectiveness of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   **Unequal Impact of Teleworking:** The disproportionate impact of teleworking on women due to increased family care burdens, and the lack of adequate regulation or physical space for home offices, must be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   **Visibility and Career Progression:** A risk is that working remotely could be seen as a disadvantage for promotion ("out of sight, out of mind") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Maintaining informal networks and mitigating unconscious bias in a hybrid work environment are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.
*   **Return to Austerity:** It is crucial to avoid new rounds of austerity, workforce reductions, or pay cuts, as these past policies have failed and contributed to vulnerabilities exposed by the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.
*   **Loss of Credibility:** Changing the narrative around public administration as a cost or burden is essential to stimulate a different public perception and restore trust in governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>.

## Personal Commitments for the Future
Leaders in public employment are committed to:
*   Focusing on **people** in the civil service, ensuring the right individuals are in the right positions, and constantly supporting their adaptation and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>.
*   Actively **telling positive stories** about the public service's contributions during the crisis to build its reputation and recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
*   Ensuring **diversity of thought** and leadership, recognizing that valuable ideas can come from unexpected places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.
*   Leading by example in **personal well-being and resilience**, acknowledging the toll the crisis has taken on leaders and staff alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.
*   Providing public servants with the **skills and capacity to respond to instability**, recognizing that climate change, social crises, and natural disasters will continue to pose threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to leverage the lessons learned from the pandemic to foster a more flexible, resilient, and digitally savvy public sector, while also ensuring the well-being and continued development of its workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. This requires strategic orientation, clear goals, strong leadership, and a focus on adapting organizational culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.

[[problem_framing_in_innovation | Problem framing]] is a crucial initial step in any innovation process, as incorrectly defining the problem can lead to "subpar results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Importance of Correct Problem Framing

Effective innovation begins with identifying the "right problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. If the problem is not framed correctly, the subsequent efforts to identify potential solutions may be misdirected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Connecting Framing to Solution Ideation

Once the right problem is identified, the next step is to strategize and think about the context in which solutions will operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This strategic approach helps in generating not just any ideas, but "good ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, which can then be narrowed down for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Initial Steps in Problem Framing

To help [[problem_framing_in_innovation | frame problems]] and validate understanding, consider these low-risk approaches:

*   **Add Play and Low-Fidelity Testing**
    Play and low-fidelity methods can help test problem framing in a low-cost manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. For example, a website wireframe or acting out a service interaction can provide immediate feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   **Low or No-Cost Tests**
    Many innovators begin by framing a problem and then conducting low or no-cost tests to verify if the problem has been framed correctly and to uncover new insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. An example is prototyping a product display on paper with duct tape before investing in high-end design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.
*   **Know Your Context**
    The environment for innovation varies significantly between different countries and organizational settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. Understanding your specific context is vital for effective [[problem_framing_in_innovation | problem framing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
*   **Start Small and Build Confidence**
    Especially for those new to innovation or their organization, starting with small-scale experiments within one's own job context can build confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. This allows for testing and validating hypotheses without putting the organization at significant [[risk_management_in_innovation | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. Every job has some level of discretion, enabling individuals to run small experiments without needing formal permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.

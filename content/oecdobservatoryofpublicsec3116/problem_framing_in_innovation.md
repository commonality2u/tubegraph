Effective problem framing is critical for achieving successful outcomes in innovation. Failing to [[problem_framing_and_solving | frame the problem correctly]] can lead to subpar results, even with significant effort [00:00:04].

## Importance of Problem Framing in Ideation
Ideation, the process of identifying potential solutions, extends beyond simply collecting ideas on sticky notes; it requires a strategic approach. It's crucial to understand the context in which one is operating [00:00:37]. The list of considerations for generating good ideas and narrowing them down is extensive, guiding the selection of ideas for testing [00:00:48].

## Understanding Strategic Context
An [[overcoming_challenges_in_innovation_proposals | innovation proposal]] aims to transform an idea into something actionable, regardless of its scale, from a personal workspace test to a government-wide initiative [01:33:00]. Success hinges on thinking through how the idea fits the reality of its context [01:57:00]. There's no single "magical answer" for what a successful proposal looks like, as it is highly dependent on context [02:08:00].

A key tip for successful public sector [[overcoming_challenges_in_innovation_proposals | innovation proposals]] is to understand the strategic context [03:38:00]. An idea, no matter how brilliant, will not gain traction if the context is unsuitable [03:51:00]. For instance, an idea to improve service quality might not succeed if the current focus is on streamlining [03:55:00]. It's essential to appreciate what else is happening strategically, such as related agendas or political leadership messages that can be leveraged to frame an idea [04:06:00]. Reframing an idea to better match or appear to match the existing context can be vital [04:23:00].

## Communicating the Problem and Solution
Since [[Definition and challenges of innovation | innovation]] is new, ready mental models or examples may not exist for people to grasp the idea [04:43:00]. Therefore, communicating with the audience and tailoring the message accordingly is crucial [04:56:00]. This includes understanding decision-makers' preferencesâ€”whether they prefer data, a story, or knowledge of what other agencies have tried [05:03:00]. Identifying the most effective voice for the proposal, even if it's someone other than the idea's originator, can also be beneficial [05:42:00].

One should not assume the merits of an idea are self-evident [06:06:00]. Innovative ideas can be easily misinterpreted due to their novelty [06:15:00]. The process of arriving at an idea might not be enough for others to understand its importance, especially if they lack personal experience, research, or observations [06:22:00]. To make a proposal real and meaningful, consider:
*   **Prototyping:** Making the idea visible and tangible [06:48:00].
*   **Peer Voices:** Finding others who can advocate for the idea [06:53:00].
*   **Concrete Use Cases:** Pointing to current problems and how the proposed solution has worked elsewhere [06:59:00].
*   **Future Scenarios:** Thinking through how things might play out in different future situations [07:15:00].

## Testing Problem Framing and Ideas
Early-stage prototyping and testing can help in [[problem_framing_and_solving | framing a problem]] [02:59:00]. This includes low-fidelity testing, such as using wireframes for a website or role-playing service interactions, to gather immediate feedback [02:59:00]. This process helps flesh out the reality of the innovation, revealing steps involved, potential dependencies, and providing more information about the time element [02:59:00].

Many innovators first [[problem_framing_and_solving | frame a problem]] and then seek a low or no-cost, low-fidelity method to test their ideas and validate if the problem was framed correctly [02:59:00]. For example, a high-end thermostat like the Nest started as a roll of duct tape and a piece of paper to test the display and size, costing almost no money [02:59:00]. This approach validates hypotheses and strengthens the eventual proposal without risking the team or organization [02:59:00].

## When Rejection Occurs
If a proposal is rejected despite strong conviction, it might be due to incorrect timing [02:59:00]. Strategies for dealing with rejection include:
*   **Waiting for the Right Time:** Sometimes, the idea is perfect, but the context isn't ready [02:59:00].
*   **Reframing the Idea:** Adapting the idea to align better with the current context and political signals [02:59:00].
*   **Building a Coalition:** Bringing along supportive colleagues and building a network of people who understand and can advocate for the idea [02:59:00].
*   **Finding Outside Voices:** Seeking stakeholders or external organizations who appreciate the idea and can lend their support [02:59:00].
*   **Lateral Thinking:** Sometimes, it's necessary to find indirect ways to advance the idea [02:59:00].
*   **Recognizing When to Wait:** Accepting that some ideas may need to wait for a different context [02:59:00].

It's also important to reflect on whether the idea was "framed in the right way" if it fails to resonate [03:44:00]. Asking decision-makers what insights they possess that are being missed can unlock valuable information [03:44:00].

## Common Issues with Proposals
Several issues can arise when presenting proposals, even after careful [[Problem Framing in Innovation | problem framing]]:
*   **Decision-Maker Understanding:** Decision-makers may not fully grasp what they've agreed to, leading to surprises later [03:33:00]. It's crucial to watch for signs that their understanding differs from yours [03:33:00].
*   **Lack of Flexibility:** Innovative projects inherently involve unexpected issues [03:33:00]. Avoid building critical dependencies into the proposal that make it vulnerable to surprises [03:33:00]. Being overly specific can also be problematic [03:33:00].
*   **Absence of an Escape Clause:** It's important to consider how to gracefully exit a project if it doesn't work as hoped [03:33:00]. The public sector often has a tendency to continue investing in projects even when they aren't working [03:33:00]. An escape clause also allows for disengagement if a project goes in a different direction, or if a successful innovation becomes solely dependent on one person, hindering its sustainability [03:33:00].
*   **Information Balance:** Finding the right balance of information for decision-makers is key [03:33:00]. Avoid patronizing them while also not assuming they know everything, especially if the idea is new [03:33:00]. Testing the proposal with people deeply familiar and loosely familiar with the issue can help find this balance [03:33:00].
*   **Scope Creep:** This can happen in two ways [03:33:00]:
    *   **Overexpansion:** Adding too many elements, making the project unrecognizable and dangerous for an [[Definition and challenges of innovation | innovation]] that needs to test key things [03:33:00].
    *   **Core Removal:** Cutting out the most interesting and meaningful parts of the project, turning it into something no longer innovative [03:33:00].

## Reframing Failure
Government often avoids the word "failure," but it's important to reframe the concept of failure in [[Definition and challenges of innovation | innovation]] [03:00:09]. Starting small and testing, limiting exposure when things don't work, is a different framing than simply admitting failure [03:00:09]. This shifts the focus from failure to learning, especially in contexts of high uncertainty where outcomes are unknown [03:00:09].

The difference between success and failure in [[Definition and challenges of innovation | innovation]] can be razor-thin due to chance and high uncertainty [03:00:09]. An unrelated external event can transform a perceived failure into a success [03:00:09]. It's necessary to nuance the concepts of success and failure, recognizing that there are many shades of both [03:00:09]. Ensuring that every effort has multiple payoffs is the best way to avoid using the word "failure" and to deliver value regardless of the primary outcome [03:00:09].

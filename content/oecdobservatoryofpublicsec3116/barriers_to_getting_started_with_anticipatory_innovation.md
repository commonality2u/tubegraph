Getting started with [[Anticipatory Innovation|anticipatory innovation]] in the public sector presents several challenges, often leading to an "impact gap" where good futures thinking doesn't translate into action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

## Core Challenges Identified by Portuguese Public Managers
From the perspective of potential users, four major issues hinder the adoption of [[Anticipatory Innovation|anticipatory innovation]]:
*   **Uneasiness with Future Uncertainty** People often feel uncomfortable dealing with uncertainty and may try to avoid thinking about it or repress it through rigid prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. They might create an "idealized way of dealing with the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Sense of Urgency** Public organizations are constantly dealing with day-to-day issues, making it difficult to grasp future horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Past Routines** A tendency to rely on what has worked before can perpetuate outdated solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Helplessness and Feeble Interest** Some managers feel "alone" when trying to put futures thinking into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. There is also a "feeble interest" and "civil skills" among upcoming practitioners because they haven't experienced the benefits of [[Anticipatory Innovation|anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Five Categories of Barriers
The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) categorizes the main barriers to embedding [[Anticipatory Innovation|anticipatory innovation]] and strategic foresight in governments into five broad areas:

1.  **Competency Barriers** Strategic foresight practice is not universally embedded across governments, often existing only in "pockets of excellence" rather than systematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
2.  **Cultural Barriers** These include unreasonable expectations that strategic foresight will act like an "oracle" revealing the future, relying solely on experts to predict what will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Experts can offer valuable knowledge, but the future is "always under construction" and imperfectly known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.
3.  **Cognitive Barriers** Humans often struggle with the complexity, uncertainty, and exponentiality of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. This can lead to:
    *   Avoiding uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>
    *   Falling prey to groupthink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>
    *   Recency and availability bias, over-applying recent lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>
    *   A simple "lack of imagination" to consider unbelievable or surprising future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>
4.  **Corporate Barriers** Many organizations hold an implicit, often outdated, "official version of the future" which can lead to "zombie futures" that are out of step with a fast-changing reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.
5.  **Communication Barriers** Different perceptions of the future within an organization, if left implicit, can lead to surprises. While diversity in thinking is valuable, a lack of shared narratives or constructive disagreement can be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.

## Country-Specific Manifestations of Barriers

### Chile
In Chile, the current funding situation for science, technology, and innovation dedicates less than 20% to future-facing initiatives in an organized way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>. This is due to several small initiatives not being organized as a system, leading to a lack of:
*   Sufficient political agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>
*   Adequate funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>
*   Multidisciplinary technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>

### Denmark
Despite a long history of public sector innovation with a strong "bottom-up" and citizen-focused approach, Denmark exhibits "complacency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. While strong in enhancement and adaptive innovation, [[Anticipatory Innovation|anticipatory innovation]] and mission-oriented innovation are considered weak spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. A key challenge is the role of politicians and how to engage them in discussions about "desired futures" and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

### Slovenia
Slovenia faces the challenge of introducing [[Anticipatory Innovation|anticipatory approaches]] through concrete cases, as a comprehensive system for support is still under development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. Key difficulties include:
*   Gaining leadership and political buy-in, which can fluctuate with changes in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.
*   Politicians often prioritize "quick results" and struggle with "intangible solutions" and funding long-term initiatives related to the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.
*   The need for civil servants to maintain motivation and use soft skills for collaboration and co-creation despite external challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

## Addressing the Barriers
Overcoming these barriers requires:
*   Translating [[Anticipatory Innovation|anticipatory innovation]] concepts into practical actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Providing support and constructive criticism for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   Engaging users in the development of tools like the [[Developing and Implementing an Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit|Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit]] to ensure relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.
*   Socializing the skills of imagination, boldness, and prospection within public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.
*   Recognizing that [[Anticipatory Innovation|anticipatory innovation]] and strategic foresight are not panaceas and require "long and sustained effort to bear fruit," often decades of consistent work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.
*   Communicate "uncomfortable knowledge" about the future to decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>.
*   The creation of "authorizing environment and agency" within governments to favor the practice of strategic foresight and [[Anticipatory Innovation|anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

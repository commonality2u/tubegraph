Co-creation is a collaborative approach to policymaking and service delivery that involves engaging a wide range of stakeholders to identify problems, design solutions, and implement initiatives. This process leads to more robust solutions and greater support for decisions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Defining Co-creation

For the context of public policy, co-creation is defined as involving stakeholders in identifying all dimensions of a problem or issue, and then designing and implementing solutions through a generative exchange of insights and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This includes:
*   Co-designing policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   Co-constructing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   Co-experiencing and improving what has been co-created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>

Co-creation differs significantly from merely informing (announcing decisions) or traditional consultation practices, which often result in "monologues" or conflicting ideas without genuine exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. It emphasizes a generative exchange where people "get together in some way online or offline and talk and brush off their ideas and align around their path forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Benefits of Co-creation

[[collaboration_and_innovation_in_public_sector|Cocreation]] and [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement|stakeholder engagement in mission setting]] offers several advantages for public sector innovation:
*   **Robust Solutions and Support** It leads to more robust solutions and greater support for decisions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Addressing Complexity** Co-creation is crucial for dealing with complex systems because no single central authority can fully understand or control them due to inherent informational problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Building Legitimacy and Transparency** It helps construct legitimacy, especially when moving beyond traditional policy-making processes, ensuring ethical conduct and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. Open documentation and "working out loud" are critical for transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.
*   **Distributed Learning** Co-creation fosters a distributed learning capacity within the system, where all partners become a learning community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. Officials can learn more from participants in a day than from a year of detailed study with consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
*   **Faster Implementation and Buy-in** While initially time-consuming, the long-term implementation and public acceptance are significantly more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.
*   **Trust Building** Authenticity, meaning what you say, and respecting the process are crucial for building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.
*   **Protection Against Lobbyists** An open and transparent co-creation process can protect public administrations from undue influence by lobbyists, as all interactions and outcomes are in the open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.
*   **Agility in Crisis** Crises like the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the need for more agile, iterative policymaking, which co-creation supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.

## Examples from the Field

### European Commission: Circular Plastics Alliance
The European Commission has used participatory engagement for over a decade, including co-creation with stakeholders and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
An example is the Circular Plastics Alliance, aiming to recycle 10 million tons of used plastic into new products by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This complex problem involved stakeholders across the entire value chain, including chemical producers, product designers, consumers, waste collectors, recyclers, public authorities, and unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Instead of legislating, the Commission proposed an alliance, inviting value chain members to co-build solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Process**: Started with CEOs of main industry and consumer groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Followed by 14 fully participatory working group meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Methods**: Classic participation techniques like World Cafe, Open Space Technology, Circle Practice, and newly developed methods were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Every meeting was scripted down to the minute, ensuring freedom for discussion while maintaining structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: A declaration with 120 signatories was produced, reflecting a generative exchange and trust-building among participants who moved from competition to collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Online Adaptation**: The established trust allowed for a smooth transition to online meetings during the pandemic, although informal interactions were missed, the reach to broader audiences increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Slovenian Ministry of Public Administration: Innovative.si
The innovative.si project aims to creatively resolve complex social challenges and build employee competencies for new ways of working, strengthening an [[collaboration_and_innovation_in_public_sector|innovation culture in public administration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Approach**: Matches challenges with facilitators (internal or external) to navigate co-creative processes towards desired outcomes, often involving public sector employees in facilitation to learn methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   **Key Points**:
    *   **People are Key**: Beyond methodologies and tools, skilled and motivated people are crucial for inclusive solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
    *   **Innovation Community Platform**: An optional but growing platform (over 400 members from public, private, and academic sectors) for networking, learning, support, and sharing good practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
    *   **Innovative Ambassadors**: Individuals who actively participate in the community and their work environment, acting as entry points in their institutions and promoting co-creative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. There are currently 70 ambassadors across ministries and governmental services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

### Cogo Digital Toolkit for Public Administration Transformation
The Cogo Digital Toolkit, financed by Horizon 2020, aims to provide holistic support for public organizations to implement [[tools_and_approaches_for_implementing_cocreation_in_public_sector|cocreation]] at the service level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. It comprises four interconnected tools:
1.  **Coready**: Helps public servants assess their organization's readiness for co-creation through a self-evaluation questionnaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. It provides a roadmap with ideas and best practices to improve areas of low scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
2.  **Coserve**: Helps organizations determine which public service is most suitable for renewal through co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
3.  **Corenew**: Actively includes service users in the renewal process, building on user journey mapping to help users discuss problems and suggest improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
4.  **Comaster**: Assesses the quality of co-creation that took place, helping identify areas for future improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

### Dark Matter Labs: Reimagining Institutions and Democracy
Indy Johar highlights that co-creation should be a continuous act, not a linear process, acknowledging the complexity and continuous evolution of problem domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
*   **Case Study: Mental Health in Sweden**: Working with a city in Sweden on mental health, a multi-actor problem involving schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. The "Mind Shift" community was built because no single central agency could drive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. This fosters awareness of interdependencies and drives change collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.
*   **Role of Politicians**: Politicians should hold the space, providing generosity and integrity, rather than having all the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.

## Key Preconditions and Success Factors

Implementing effective co-creation requires careful consideration of several factors:

### Mindset and Skills
*   **Openness and Knowledge**: A willingness to embrace new ideas, views, and opinions, backed by the necessary knowledge, is essential for progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.
*   **Systemic View**: Public sector challenges require a systemic view and holistic solutions, moving beyond addressing mere symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.
*   **"Holding Space" Capability**: This is a fundamentally different skill from traditional project management (which focuses on control) and requires high levels of emotional intelligence and social presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.
*   **Recruitment vs. Training**: It may require rebalancing departmental capabilities and even recruiting individuals with "holding space" skills rather than solely relying on training those accustomed to control-oriented roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Political Buy-in**: Top-level political backing and momentum are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. This includes having a project owner or sponsor with the mandate and commitment to deliver solutions in a co-creative manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

### Process and Organizational Structure
*   **Clear Purpose**: Define the problem to be solved, allowing participants to help define the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
*   **Facilitation**: A high-powered hosting team is needed to manage the process, alongside an advanced secretariat to handle content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
*   **Authenticity**: Be authentic throughout the process; do not solicit input only to revert to pre-determined solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.
*   **Early Engagement**: Engaging stakeholders early on increases support and prevents later obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.
*   **Adaptability**: Co-creation processes are suitable for complex challenges requiring shared knowledge and experience, not for simple problems with pre-known solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **Implementation & Communication**: Adopt concrete commitments with clear responsibilities and deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. Constant two-way communication about progress is vital for understanding and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.
*   **Wider Context**: Active participation in [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration|international collaboration]] initiatives, flexible regulative frameworks, and strong political consensus across ideological lines are beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.
*   **Staff Capacity**: Staff need project management skills, regular training, and sufficient autonomy, with a willingness to grant discretion to external stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.
*   **Organizational Features**: Organizations should minimize silos, be aware of the limits of conventional policy-making, and have a strategic intent for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Meticulously record and widely publish all proceedings and outcomes. This open presence helps protect against undue influence from lobbyists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>.
*   **Inclusive Participation**: Ensure diverse representation by actively recruiting participants that reflect the demographic profile of the community, as seen in Antwerp's participatory budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. This also involves considering "future generations" who are not present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
*   **Distinguishing Interests**: The public official's role includes provoking challenges to ensure that the "public interest" is held, even if it diverges from a "community interest" formed by a group of stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.

## Challenges and Overcoming Them

Common challenges include:
*   **Hierarchical Mindset**: Many public administrations still operate with a top-down, hierarchical mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   **Lack of Participatory Skills**: Governments may lack the necessary participatory knowledge, skills, and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. The European Commission has trained over 3,000 officials in participatory methods to address this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.
*   **Time Consumption**: While the initial phase may be time-consuming, it pays off in more effective implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Bureaucratic Interpretation**: Practitioners should not interpret or filter participants' outcomes, as this risks losing trust and devaluing the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.
*   **Rigid Budgets**: Fixed two-year budget cycles in large organizations (e.g., the European Commission) pose a structural difficulty for agile, iterative policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.
*   **Legitimacy in Agile Policy**: In an age of "long emergencies," policy needs to be fast and agile, involving continuous large-scale experiments. This raises questions about how legitimacy is constructed when decisions are made iteratively outside traditional parliamentary processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:24">[00:54:24]</a>.

Ultimately, successful co-creation requires a fundamental shift in institutional frameworks, moving towards a culture of care and openness that embraces uncertainty and allows for collaborative decision-making in a complex world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.

Governments must embrace [[innovation in government | innovation]] for three primary reasons to effectively serve their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03"> [00:00:03]</a>.

## 1. Enhancing Impact and Value Delivery

Firstly, governments have yet to solve all the problems faced by their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03"> [00:00:03]</a>. By [[innovation in government | innovating]] and altering their approaches, governments can achieve greater impact and deliver new or better value to their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11"> [00:00:11]</a>. This pursuit of more impactful solutions necessitates [[public sector innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17"> [00:02:17]</a>.

## 2. Adapting to a Changing World

Secondly, the global environment is continually evolving around governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"> [00:00:26]</a>. Many existing governmental systems, such as healthcare, welfare, and taxation, were designed in the 1950s and no longer align with the demands of the contemporary world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36"> [00:00:36]</a>.

Key aspects of this change include:
*   **Digitalization and Online Services** People now conduct activities online and expect the same ease of experience when interacting with government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49"> [00:00:49]</a>. The widespread digitalization necessitates that governments adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03"> [00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Evolving Societal Needs** Citizens' needs are changing, as the way people live their lives differs significantly from the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06"> [00:01:06]</a>. Governments must respond to these new societal demands, as well as to new systems like digital technology, to ensure [[government_innovation_and_adaptation | adaptation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12"> [00:01:12]</a>.

Therefore, governments must [[government_innovation_and_adaptation | adapt]] and change alongside the shifts occurring around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27"> [00:02:27]</a>.

## 3. Anticipating Future Challenges

Thirdly, governments must anticipate and prepare for fundamental future changes and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46"> [00:01:46]</a>. The world faces complex challenges and inherent uncertainty, including climate change, aging populations, and the emergence of new types of societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51"> [00:01:51]</a>. To prepare for and anticipate the future, [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04"> [00:02:04]</a>. It requires a different kind of thinking today to be ready for tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11"> [00:02:11]</a>. This forward-looking approach is necessary to prepare for changes that will fundamentally alter both how governments function and how people live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38"> [00:02:38]</a>.

This article summarizes key insights from the launch of the report "Harnessing Mission Governance to Achieve National Climate Targets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, which analyzes the climate mitigation reports of 15 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The discussion highlights the potential of mission governance to strengthen climate action and address persistent challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Current State of Climate Action and its [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_implementing_missionoriented_climate_strategies | Challenges]]

Significant progress has been made in climate action, particularly with clean energy markets expanding due to government policies and market forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. In the last year, global investment in renewables and low-carbon technologies reached $2 trillion US, double the amount spent on fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Approximately 40 countries have successfully decoupled emissions from GDP growth, demonstrating that [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate action]] does not hinder economic expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

However, this momentum is at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The pace of [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate policy]] adoption and strengthening has slowed to only 1-2% per year, down from 10% annually in previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Contributing factors include:
*   Slower global growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   Multiple geopolitical tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   Rising public debt straining government budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   Shifting government priorities and changes in administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Pushback from sectors like agriculture, risking a drop in public and political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   A persistent perception that [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate action]] may reduce economic opportunities or that the net-zero transition is not investable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Despite these [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_implementing_missionoriented_climate_strategies | challenges]], stronger [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate action]] is shown to provide an economic boost, with a projected net gain of 0.2% in global GDP by 2040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Factoring in avoided climate damages, this could reach up to 13% of GDP growth by 2100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. However, achieving this requires policies to be integrated across core government ministries and aligned with national development strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Early engagement with the private sector to provide policy certainty, strengthening financial institutions, and ensuring a people-centered just transition are also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Innovation and Technology
Innovation has driven significant progress in the past 20 years, seen in rapidly decreasing prices of batteries, solar, and wind power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The IEA estimates that about 35% of necessary CO2 emission reductions by 2050 will come from technologies not yet commercially available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Investment for green startups has increased significantly since the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

However, the current pace of innovation is insufficient to meet carbon neutrality goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Climate-related patent filings have decreased as a share of all patenting over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Current efforts focus on incremental innovation and deploying existing technologies rather than R&D for entirely new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Innovation must be combined with complementary changes in skills, infrastructure, regulations, and mobility patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Innovation policies need to be integrated into broader [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate commitments]], with mission-oriented approaches playing a key role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## The Case for Mission Governance in Climate Policy

Mission governance is a powerful tool to address the complexity and cross-sectoral nature of [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. It ensures that national climate targets, such as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), are effectively pursued and delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The report finds that integrating missions into national climate mitigation commitments could be a way to ensure the issue is taken more seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

### Key Attributes of Mission Governance
Mission governance can enhance governments' ability to deliver effective, equitable, and sustained climate mitigation outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. Its attributes include:
*   **Clear and Measurable Objectives**: Missions establish specific, targeted, and time-bound goals that anchor [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate commitments]] within government strategic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. This ensures climate mitigation and adaptation are prioritized at the highest institutional levels, guiding resource allocation and enabling [[crosssectoral_and_interdisciplinary_collaboration_for_climate_policy | stronger cross-sectoral coordination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:44">[01:13:44]</a>. An example is the UK's Cabinet Committee on Climate Change, chaired by the Prime Minister, which ensures unified action and accountability across government departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>.
*   **Capacity Building**: It emphasizes strengthening the capabilities of public officials and institutions, which is vital given that climate strategies require technical expertise and adaptive policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. The report highlights the importance of investing in administrative capacities, such as scenario forecasting, risk management, and performance evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. Sweden's Impact Innovation Programs include an accelerator function to build public sector capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Based Decision Making**: Mission governance integrates robust data and continuous learning into the governance process, allowing for effective progress measurement, impact understanding, and policy adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. Denmark's "innomissions" explicitly integrate experimentation within mission portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
*   **Stronger Stakeholder Engagement**: It fosters transparency and equity by promoting meaningful engagement of diverse stakeholders, including business, civil society, local communities, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. This builds trust, enhances public support, and delivers effective and fair climate mitigation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>. The New Zealand Climate Change Commission prioritizes improving stakeholder engagement to enable greater societal contributions to net-zero emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>.

## Pillars of Mission Governance

The OECD has developed a mission governance framework with five pillars:

1.  **Structures**: Framework anchoring mandates, legal and institutional arrangements, and high-level bodies responsible for climate action are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>. Examples include the UK's Climate Change Act and New Zealand's Climate Change Response, or France's General Secretariat for Ecological Planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. A dedicated mission management team and secretariat are essential to prevent the shared responsibility for complex challenges from disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.
2.  **Strategic Orientation**: Clear direction-setting, including roadmaps and sustained political action across electoral cycles, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. Canada's political consensus on climate targets and Sweden's cross-sectoral approaches show that governance mechanisms can tackle political support issues across government terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>. Societal engagement and public participation, though not universally utilized, are extremely important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.
3.  **Coordination**: Mechanisms to involve different government bodies horizontally and vertically are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>. France's General Secretary of Ecological Planning and Sweden aim to align actions across horizontal bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. Chile's regional climate change council focuses on vertical coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>. Mobilizing communities, the private sector, and non-profits remains a challenge, though initiatives like Sweden's Fossil-Free Sweden involve private actors in climate target planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.
4.  **Execution**: This involves crowding in resources from external actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. A broad policy mix with access to comprehensive approaches and different instruments (e.g., legal, market-creating) is crucial for impactful missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>. Examples include New Zealand's agricultural emissions pricing and the UK's zero-emission vehicle measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>. Process integration, experimentation, flexibility, and capabilities are critical, with experimentation being a particularly lagging area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.
5.  **Resources**: Ensuring long-term financial commitment is challenging, especially with new geopolitical issues arising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. Public funding is generally available, but private investment is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. Systematic and coherent approaches are needed to ensure investor confidence and shape markets towards climate goals, such as Denmark's carbon tax on agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

While existing climate mitigation frameworks are strong in framework anchoring, roadmaps, and policy mixes, they often fall short in scaling initiatives, private investments, experimentation, mobilization, [[challenges_in_coordinating_stakeholders_in_mission_oriented_policies | coordination actions]], and process integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

## [[role_of_climate_councils_in_fostering_climate_action | Role of Climate Councils]] and Central Government

### [[role_of_climate_councils_in_fostering_climate_action | Climate Councils]]
The International Climate Council's Network (ICCN) comprises different [[role_of_climate_councils_in_fostering_climate_action | climate councils]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Their key role is to advise governments and parliaments on [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate policies]] based on climate science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

[[role_of_climate_councils_in_fostering_climate_action | Climate councils]] face several [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_implementing_missionoriented_climate_strategies | challenges]]:
*   **Polarization**: [[climate_change_and_public_policy | Climate change]] is increasingly politicized, making decarbonization harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Councils aim to protect their evidence-based independent advisory role against changing political tides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Hard-to-Abate Sectors**: While progress has been made in decarbonizing power, less has been done in sectors like agriculture and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Councils bridge the gap between science and policy implementation in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Weak Governance**: Inadequate channels in government often prevent [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate policy]] from being informed by science and engaging the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Councils can strengthen [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate frameworks]] and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Short Time Horizons**: Short election cycles lead to policy flip-flops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Councils help ensure consistent, politically neutral, and evidence-rooted [[climate_change_and_public_policy | policymaking]] over long time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

[[role_of_climate_councils_in_fostering_climate_action | Climate councils]] can assist in mission governance by providing assessment progress against targets and forward-looking advice on pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. Governments create missions, while councils' specific roles vary depending on their remit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>. Some councils, like South Africa's Presidential Climate Change Commission, chaired by the president, can play a central coordination role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

### Centers of Government
Centers of government have become increasingly important in a complex world with intertwined policy issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>. They are well-positioned to champion integrated policies and leverage their convening power for [[crosssectoral_and_interdisciplinary_collaboration_for_climate_policy | cross-government alignment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>. This is critical for [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate action]], as environment ministers often lack high cabinet ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. About 90% of OECD centers of government now prioritize key objectives, and over half mandate strategic plans in [[crosssectoral_and_interdisciplinary_collaboration_for_climate_policy | cross-cutting areas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>.

In South Africa, the Presidential Climate Change Commission, located in the Office of the President, was established to adopt a mission-driven approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. This prevents [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate policy]] from being seen as solely an environmental initiative, ensuring broad alignment across government departments and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. This systematic and [[crosssectoral_and_interdisciplinary_collaboration_for_climate_policy | cross-sectoral approach]] is crucial as climate challenges are interconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_implementing_missionoriented_climate_strategies | Challenges and Opportunities in Implementing Mission Governance]]

Implementing mission governance involves overcoming systemic issues:
*   **Interdisciplinary and Collaborative Approach**: [[climate_change_and_public_policy | Climate change]] is economy-wide, implicating multiple agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. Many governments are not equipped for the radical [[crosssectoral_and_interdisciplinary_collaboration_for_climate_policy | collaboration]] required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>. A mission-oriented approach is extremely useful in fostering this [[crosssectoral_and_interdisciplinary_collaboration_for_climate_policy | collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>.
*   **Perception of Climate Policy**: A common challenge is the perception that [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate policy]] is solely the responsibility of "climate people" rather than a whole-of-government endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a>.
*   **Public Engagement**: Public consultation and engagement are often insufficient, leading to backlash and negative impacts on vulnerable communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:18">[01:24:18]</a>.
*   **Capacity Constraints and Siloed Approaches**: Local-level capacity constraints, narrow Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and siloed budgets hinder [[crosssectoral_and_interdisciplinary_collaboration_for_climate_policy | collaboration]], potentially leading to contradictory actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>.

### Overcoming the "STI Trap"
While [[climate_and_environmental_missions_in_the_european_union | missions]] have shown progress compared to traditional Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) governance, they are often still "innovation missions" rather than the transformative missions needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>. This "STI trap" means missions are often led by STI authorities, with commitments primarily coming from STI instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:08">[01:35:08]</a>. There's a mismatch between mission goals and the broad policy mix needed for realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:44">[01:35:44]</a>. Missions need to access other public interventions and funding streams, including support for regulatory change, skill development, economic incentives, and scale-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>.

### Pathways for Transition Missions
The OECD identifies several scenarios for evolving innovation missions into real transition missions:
1.  **Gradual Broadening**: Missions slowly integrate and broaden by learning-by-doing, building trust and improving over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>.
2.  **Transfer of Leadership**: Mission leadership shifts from STI authorities to the "challenge owners" (e.g., climate, transport, environment ministries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>. This is sensitive due to political turf issues and budget competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:08">[01:38:08]</a>.
3.  **Dedicated Mission Agencies**: Missions are led by dedicated agencies reporting to several ministries, like the Research Council of Norway which reports to over 15 ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>.
4.  **Elevating Missions**: Missions are led by central government bodies, such as the Prime Minister's office or powerful transition committees, directly tying them to a broad climate agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:12">[01:39:12]</a>.
5.  **Regional/Local Missions**: Smaller-scale "micro-missions" operated at regional or local levels can achieve better integration across silos, exemplified by city climate contracts in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:28">[01:40:28]</a>. This approach might also involve new types of social contracts at the national level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:51">[01:40:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[integration_of_national_climate_targets_with_missionoriented_approaches | Integrating mission governance principles into national climate efforts]] is crucial for making climate action systematic and concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. Developing targeted missions with clear commitments and timelines ensures that national climate targets, such as those in the Paris Agreement, are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. Mission governance can strengthen political support and societal engagement, moving beyond reactive responses to climate crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. Enhancing innovation and experimentation in [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate policy]] and integrating them into current actions are also vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>. The Mission Action Lab aims to support the implementation process and delivery of these missions on the ground, fostering [[future_oriented_governance | future-oriented governance]] and systemic transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>.

The integration of quality and [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] is crucial for effective public sector governance, especially when navigating global challenges and striving for improved public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Research suggests that both quality and [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] are essential and interconnected processes that should not be treated separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) as a Tool for Quality and Innovation

The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) is presented as a significant tool that assists organizations in preparing for uncertainties and cultivating attributes to overcome disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. It promotes constant learning and helps organizations understand their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

Key aspects of CAF's role:
*   **Mindset Shift** A holistic approach to performance analysis through CAF can change the mindset of an organization and its staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Resilience Building** CAF embeds characteristics of resilient and [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovative organizations]] identified in Deloitte's 2021 Global Resilience Report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. These include:
    *   Being prepared with clear short and long-term priorities and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
    *   Being adaptable with flexible teams and an adaptable workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   Being collaborative by breaking down silos and increasing internal and external collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
    *   Being trustworthy by building trust between leaders and employees and ensuring transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   Being responsible, adapting in response to crises beyond mere bottom-line considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement** Organizations that have invested in paths towards excellence with CAF or other quality tools have consistently outperformed others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. [[Innovation in the public sector | Innovation]] and resilience are about thinking ahead and being well-prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

The CAF 2020 model explicitly includes [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]], mentioning the term 50 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. It is reinforced in principle 6, "Continuous learning, [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] and improvement," and in criteria 2 (Strategy and Planning), specifically sub-criteria 2.4, "Manage change and [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] in an agile way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>.

## Case Studies in Public Sector Innovation

### Vienna City Administration

Vienna's city administration, with 1.9 million citizens and 60,000 employees, has used CAF for almost 20 years, alongside other quality management tools like ISO 9001 and EFQM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This multi-model approach allows departments to choose the best fit for their specific needs, though CAF seamlessly blends with all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

CAF acts as a coach for:
*   **Organizational Development** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   **Culture Development** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>: It fosters a culture where everyone recognizes their role in making a difference, promoting continuous improvement and [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **Systematic Improvement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>: By detecting maturity levels and focusing on closing the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, CAF helps organizations become "fitter," more agile, and resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

[[Innovation in the public sector | Innovation]], in Vienna's view, requires a solid foundation of organizational culture, continuous development, and systematic improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. It needs space to thrive and must benefit not just the organization but also citizens and all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. By working on small improvements, organizations can achieve significant advancements, building a foundation for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. Innovation should be guided by preparedness, planning, and an understanding of impact, making citizens partners in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

### Krakow City Administration

Krakow City Office has been using CAF since 2011, conducting four self-assessments that led to several improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. After its 2017 assessment, Krakow focused on improving communication with clients (citizens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. This focus became even more critical during the COVID-19 crisis, as traditional communication channels were limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

Key initiatives included:
*   **Taxpayer Portal (2018)**: An electronic tool with an information platform on local taxes and fees, and a personalized channel for communication and tax payment. It significantly reduced phone inquiries and became a preferred channel for many citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Official Language (2019)**: Guidelines and training workshops were developed to help officials write and speak in a more inclusive and understandable manner, improving citizen comprehension and reducing administrative delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Parcel Lockers for City Services (2020)**: Inspired by the COVID-19 crisis, this innovation allowed citizens to pick up physical documents like license plates from lockers at their convenience, reducing queues and contact at office buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
*   **Integrated City Contact Center (2021-2022)**: Planned to gather staff who can answer questions about various city services and municipal units in one place, reducing wait times and confusion about which department to contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

CAF served as a "trigger" that inspired these new ideas and focused the attention of both management and employees on client communication, demonstrating that [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] is a continuous process rather than a finite project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. Initial motivation for CAF implementation in Krakow was financial (EU funding), but the positive results led to continued commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.

### Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and Sports

Through their first CAF self-assessment, the Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and Sports identified the need for an employee survey to assess satisfaction, climate, and understanding of the ministry's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. This led to a [[collaboration_and_innovation_in_public_sector | collaborative innovation]] with seven other public organizations to create a uniform methodology for employee surveys, allowing for comparative analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.

The "Employee Eyes" questionnaire was developed in two months through open, honest, and trustworthy collaboration, focusing on actionable items that could lead to value-added changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. The process highlighted the importance of not just conducting the survey and disseminating results, but critically, the "survey result implementation" phase, which requires significant resources and effort to act upon findings and introduce changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. The project demonstrates the added value of [[collaboration_and_innovation_in_public_sector | cooperation]] among CAF users at a national level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Crisis and Future Resilience

The COVID-19 crisis forced public administrations to rapidly respond to its effects on economies, societies, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. This included:
*   Creating new institutional structures and increasing cross-ministerial coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
*   Approving emergency regulations and fast-tracking new rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   Implementing new health and sanitary protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.
*   Rapid digitalization and widespread teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>.
*   Establishing new communication protocols to combat disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

These experiences highlight that public sector organizations need to be fit for the future by strengthening their resilience to shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. Initial lessons emphasize:
*   Preparedness and agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
*   Cultivating skills for complex problem-solving and [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
*   Developing foresight capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.
*   Strengthening coordination, consultation, and crisis communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.
*   Embedding cross-cutting challenges like environmental issues, inclusiveness, and digitalization into strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.

The CAF model can help assess and improve organizational resilience by examining aspects like leadership adaptation, contingency planning, teleworking policies, HR strategies, partnerships, and procurement procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. The OECD, in collaboration with the European Commission and 11 countries, is undertaking a project to study how public sector organizations managed the crisis, identify emerging [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovations]] for resilience, and support the CAF network's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

## Impact on Human Resource Management

A study conducted in Slovenia indicates a significant impact of CAF implementation on human resource management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. The pandemic highlighted weaknesses in this area, underscoring the need for step-by-step improvements in managing human resources, especially with the shift to remote and hybrid working models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. This includes rethinking knowledge management strategies in a distributed work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.

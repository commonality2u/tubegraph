The COVID-19 crisis, along with other challenges like bushfires in Australia, has significantly impacted the public sector, revealing the critical role of public service and accelerating the adoption of remote work. This shift has presented both opportunities and challenges for the [[future of public employment | future of public employment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## Immediate Impact and Adaptability

The crisis demonstrated that public administration can be agile and responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Key observations include:

*   **Slovenia's Experience**: Practically overnight, the civil service in Slovenia shifted to remote work, with almost 70% of civil servants working from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. A survey found that over half of civil servants experienced higher engagement, efficiency, and satisfaction while teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This broke the stereotype of the public sector being rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Australia's Experience**: The Australian public service found it could work remotely at scale, with some roles seeing increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This opens up new markets for talent, as geographical location becomes less restrictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Ireland's Experience**: There was a clear demonstration of a workforce that is flexible, adaptive, and [[innovation in the public sector | innovative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Effective delivery relies on having good people who are comfortable, competent, and capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **General Learning**: Public employees are not rigid; they are flexible and skilled, capable of changing their work methods and using their knowledge, often without adequate prior training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

The crisis also highlighted the critical role of the public service in meeting community needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, leading to a heightened awareness of its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Challenges and Risks of Remote Work

While remote work offers many benefits, it also presents significant challenges that need careful management:

*   **Work-Life Balance and Burnout**: Achieving work-life balance is crucial, and there's a risk of burnout, especially for those juggling work with family responsibilities like childcare due to school lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Adequate Equipment and Regulation**: Not all workers have adequate physical space or equipment at home, and proper regulation of working conditions is often lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   **Disproportionate Impact on Women**: Teleworking has had a disproportionate impact on women due to increased care burdens, and the lack of physical presence can impact the reporting of domestic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   **Loss of Social Component and Informal Networks**: Employees miss the social aspect of working in the office, and informal interactions crucial for collaboration and idea generation are reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.
*   **Visibility and Promotion**: There is concern that remote work could lead to an "out of sight, out of mind" scenario, potentially disadvantaging those working from home in terms of visibility and promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Unconscious bias needs to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.
*   **Aging Workforce and Skills Gap**: Countries like Italy face an aging public administration workforce, which may be less adaptable to new digital knowledge and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.

## Opportunities and the Future of Public Employment

The crisis provides a significant opportunity to rethink public employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>:

*   **Hybrid Models**: The future will likely involve a balance between working from home and in the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. Job policies should be designed to leverage the best of both remote and office work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.
*   **Public Service Hubs**: Australia and Ireland are exploring public service hubs closer to where people live, allowing connection without lengthy commutes to central business districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.
*   **Learning Organizations**: Public services should become "learning organizations" to ensure skills keep pace with new technologies and complex societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Investment in people and their skills is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   **Intergenerational Cooperation**: Promoting coaching and mentorship between younger, digitally savvy workers and older, experienced civil servants is vital to ensure no one is left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Collaboration**: The crisis accelerated cross-agency and cross-team collaboration. The challenge is to embed this "one service" approach into business as usual through governance arrangements and cultural expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>.
*   **Workforce Mobility / Surge Reserve**: Australia is developing a "surge reserve" workforce that can be mobilized quickly during future crises, placing the right people in the right places at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.
*   **Political Will and Investment**: Sustained [[innovation in public sector management | innovation in public sector management]] requires political will to invest in public services, reversing decades of understaffing and cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **Changing the Narrative**: The perception of public administration as merely a "cost" or "burden" needs to change to one of an essential asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. Public employees are crucial for strengthening democratic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.

## Essential Skills and Management Practices

The future public workforce requires specific [[future skills in the public sector | future skills in the public sector]] and management practices:

*   **Digital and Data Skills**: Fundamental digital and data skills are crucial for all public servants, accelerating the need for a more digitally savvy workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.
*   **Soft Skills and Emotional Intelligence**: Leaders and managers need strong emotional intelligence, communication skills, and the ability to influence and bring people together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   **Learning Agility and Adaptability**: The most important skill will be the ability to continuously learn, innovate, and adapt to new situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
*   **Critical Thinking and Problem Solving**: Skills like critical thinking, creativity, judgment, and responsive [[public sector innovation | innovation]] are increasingly vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.
*   **Strategic Human Resources (HR)**: Building strategic HR capabilities is key to managing change and building workforce capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
*   **Leadership**: Leaders must build trust, motivate employees, and communicate effectively with remote teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>. Crisis management skills are particularly important for public service leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. Leaders also need to be visible, adaptable, and manage risk effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.
*   **Wellness and Mental Health Support**: Leaders must prioritize and support the mental well-being and wellness of their workers, recognizing the pressures of juggling work and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

In the future, a "more flexible and resilient model of public sector employment" and a "more digitally savvy public sector workforce" are widely expected outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>.

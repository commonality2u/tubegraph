[[Collaboration between government and industry]] is crucial for fostering innovation, ensuring effective regulatory governance, and addressing complex societal challenges. This involves partnerships between public sector bodies, private industries, civil society, and international organizations.

## Importance of Collaboration
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for governments to reconsider how they operate, particularly in the regulatory domain, by amplifying pre-existing challenges for public administration and regulatory policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The world is characterized by interconnected risks and opportunities, with technological change and innovation scaling rapidly, often leaving governments struggling to understand potential harms and create governance "guard rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. An agile approach to rulemaking is needed to unlock innovation's potential and shape it to protect citizens and reflect their values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

### Collaboration as a Foundation
Regulatory issues are fundamentally issues of [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | collaboration and cooperation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. When people feel excluded from policy-making processes, it can cause "pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Therefore, engaging with stakeholders and the public is essential for effective regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Mechanisms for Collaboration

### Partnerships and Networks
*   **OECD and Slovenian Presidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Union:** This event is hosted in partnership, acknowledging support from the European Institute of Public Administration and the European Commission Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Agile Nations Network:** An intergovernmental network formed to foster [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | international cooperation]] on rulemaking and practical activities to promote innovation-friendly approaches to new emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
    *   Current members include Denmark, Canada, the United Kingdom, UAE, Italy, Singapore, and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
    *   The OECD and the World Economic Forum contributed to its creation and participate as observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
    *   It aims for mutual capacity building by sharing lessons learned and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
    *   A core thought is that [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | international cooperation]] is vital to share knowledge and evidence, and to avoid unnecessary divergence in rules that could inhibit cross-border innovation and joint actions to address common risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

### Regulatory Sandboxes and Experimentation
Regulatory sandboxes are a sub-category of experimental law that temporarily waive or modify national rules to promote innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.
*   They foster innovation, reduce regulatory burden, and support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   They involve [[public_and_private_collaboration in innovation | collaboration]] between stakeholders/innovators and competent authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   Regulatory sandboxes facilitate risk sharing between innovators and authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.
*   The benefit of regulatory sandboxes is primarily to allow supervisory authorities to become accustomed to new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a>, serving as a learning platform for regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.
*   A key challenge is ensuring that lessons from experiments make their way into law and scale effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.
*   The European Commission is exploring regulatory sandboxes, acknowledging the need for safeguards to prevent undermining regulatory standards while facilitating learning and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

### Challenges and Perspectives from Industry
From a business perspective, effective [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | collaboration]] requires:
*   **Accountability:** Regulators should be accountable for decisions, with outcomes demonstrating results to taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.
*   **Informed Decision-Making:** Requires deep upskilling of regulators and policymakers in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   **Interconnectivity:** Leveraging interconnectivity positively to catch issues earlier and protect citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.
*   **Bias towards SMEs:** Policy-making should prioritize conversations with smaller SMEs and tech companies, as their implementation of technology differs from large tech firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Approach:** Applying the "minimum viable product" concept to regulation, allowing for small-scale market releases to observe, learn, and pivot quickly, rather than lengthy consultation processes that can lead to outdated regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **IP Protection and Incentives:** A lack of clear IP protection and tangible benefits for startups participating in regulatory initiatives can disincentivize their engagement in educating governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.
*   **Neutral Platform:** A neutral platform or organization is needed to promote cross-pollination and dialogue between smaller companies, larger companies, and regulators, protecting intellectual property and facilitating knowledge sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>.

### European Commission's Approach
The European Commission aims for a more flexible and agile consultation system, focusing on burden reduction (e.g., "one in, one out" approach for new burdens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. Key elements include:
*   Integrating the digital dimension more broadly into all work, from consultations to evaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.
*   Systematically looking into "digital by default" and "once only" principles in impact assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.
*   Investing in strategic foresight to anticipate future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>.
*   Increasing transparency of evidence underpinning proposals and engaging with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.
*   Developing new regulatory techniques for agile regulation, such as adaptive regulations, [[collaborative_learning_and_innovation_in_government | co-creation]], and outcome-based regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:43">[00:55:43]</a>.
*   Promoting [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | coordination and cooperation]] with member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>.
*   The "Fit for Future" platform engages high-level stakeholders, experts, and member states to assess existing legislation for simplification and adaptation to technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.

## Fostering an Entrepreneurial Public Sector
While startups can fail, governments aim for stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>. The challenge for [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | public service]] is to overcome risk aversion and accept that mistakes are part of a learning experience, particularly through experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>. Incentives should empower and encourage people in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. Promoting "administrative entrepreneurship" within the public sector is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

### The Role of Regulators
Regulators should aim to be "champions for the public" and possibly for causes like climate, shifting from a "watchdog" mentality to a supportive function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. This involves being brave enough to set clear goals and collect data to measure real-life outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:46">[01:38:46]</a>. The goal is to move towards a future where all regulation is agile, embodying the spirit of adaptation and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

The "Government Aftershocks" series, specifically a high-level forum, convened to discuss the future of public employment, recognizing that "our people" are one of the most important aspects of government's role and expectations now and in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This global dialogue aimed to contribute to a "call for action" for governments, to be developed by the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Shifting Understanding of Public Service and Employment

The COVID-19 crisis has profoundly shifted the understanding of public service and public employment.

### Increased Reputation and Relevance
In Slovenia, the civil service's reputation significantly increased because it provided measures, anti-coronal law packages rapidly, and ensured the functioning of critical infrastructure and economic support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Similarly, in Australia, the crisis, following devastating bushfires, brought into sharp focus the critical role of the public service in meeting community needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Ireland also saw a heightened awareness of the importance of public services and public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. People understood that public employees are essential to communities and societies, not merely bureaucrats defending privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

### Breaking Stereotypes: Agility and Responsiveness
The civil service has broken the stereotype of being rigid and slow to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. In Slovenia, 70% of civil servants shifted to [[remote_work_in_public_sector | remote work]] practically overnight, something unimaginable a month prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. A poll in Slovenia showed that over half of civil servants found their engagement, efficiency, and satisfaction higher while teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Across governments, the ability to work remotely at scale was proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Remote Work and Digital Adoption
The crisis demonstrated that public administration can be agile and responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Rapid adoption of digital skills, video meetings, and distance training occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The experience showed that new forms of work can lead to a more efficient and resilient civil service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. There's a strong desire not to revert to pre-crisis ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Developing Resilience and Future Skills

To further develop resilience, key changes in skills, management practices, and organizational culture are needed.

### The Learning Organization
The civil service should become a [[Future skills in the public sector | learning organization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Investing in people, their workplaces, and their skills is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Digital technologies will radically change how public administration works, and the focus should be on preparing people for this interconnected, virtual team-based future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

### Key Skills for the Future
Skills need to keep pace with new technologies and complex societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Important [[Future skills in the public sector | skills]] include critical thinking, creativity, judgment, responsive innovation, and most importantly, the ability to continuously learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### Intergenerational Cooperation
A poll in Slovenia showed that older civil servants found telework less efficient than younger ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. There's a need to foster [[Future skills in the public sector | intergenerational cooperation]] to ensure no one is left behind due to a lack of digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Promoting coaching and mentorship can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

### Importance of Soft Skills and Emotional Intelligence
Previous reforms in Australia focused on building skills for the future, particularly in managers and leaders, emphasizing learning agility and emotional intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The crisis accelerated the need for managers who can lead through change and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. Soft skills like influence, communication, and the ability to bring people along are increasingly valued over analytical ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

### Focus on Digital and Data Skills
Solid foundational skills in digital and data are crucial for staff going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. Public administration has "discovered" [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | digitalization]] and high-tech solutions during the pandemic, and these areas need to be strengthened and developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

### Workforce Wellness and Support
Leaders need to be more visible and focus on mental well-being and wellness for their staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Many public servants are juggling work from home with family responsibilities, facing fear of the unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Supporting workers and managing their health issues, including mental health, through a balance of working from home and the office, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

### Risk Management and Communities of Practice
Public servants are often seen as risk-averse, but the crisis showed their ability to manage risk and respond quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. [[Innovation in Public Sector | Communities of practice]] and cross-collaboration are essential for learning from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

### Political Will and Investment
Developing resilience also requires political will to invest in public services and public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Decades of cuts, understaffing, and increased turnover have been detrimental, as seen during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. Emergencies should not be used for political competition between parties or levels of government, as this negatively impacts effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

## Rethinking Public Employment: Opportunities and Risks

The crisis presents significant [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_sector_reform | opportunities to rethink public employment]], but also risks that need careful management.

### Hybrid Work Models and Work-Life Balance
A key opportunity is to not return to pre-crisis [[remote_work_in_public_sector | remote work]] policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. The future should involve designing a job policy that maximizes the benefits of both remote work and office work, defining which tasks are best performed in each setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. Helping civil servants achieve work-life balance and preventing burnout are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

### New Working Hubs
One idea is to create public service hubs closer to where people live, allowing public servants from different agencies to work together without long commutes to city centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>. Ireland's minister for rural affairs also announced plans for more working hubs across rural areas using state-owned properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

### Public Service Mobility and Surge Reserves
The crisis highlighted the benefits of public service mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. In Australia, a "surge reserve" workforce was mobilized from less critical functions to busy areas, which proved a positive experience, especially for younger graduates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. The aim is to formalize this into a future workforce ready to surge into help during future crises, potentially even assisting state agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.

### Avoiding Pitfalls: Unintended Consequences of Remote Work
While [[remote_work_in_public_sector | remote work]] has advantages, potential "unintended consequences" must be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. Concerns include remote workers being at a disadvantage for promotion ("out of sight, out of mind") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>, the need to support informal networks (e.g., "coffee table chat") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>, and combating unconscious bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. There is a risk of "re-traditionalization of roles" which should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. The disproportionate impact of teleworking on women due to the burden of family care needs to be regulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

### Changing the Narrative and Social Recognition
There's a need to change the narrative around public administration, moving away from viewing it as just a cost or burden on public budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. Social recognition for public service workers and the importance of government's role is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. This can help renew administrations and strengthen democratic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

### Role of Collective Bargaining
Collective bargaining proved to be a valuable tool during the pandemic to address problems and improve workers' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>. It's crucial to ensure workers can organize and form unions, as this is not the case everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>.

## Audience Poll Results

A poll conducted during the session asked attendees about the medium-term impacts of the coronavirus crisis on public employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>:
*   About half of respondents believe it will lead to a more agile and resilient model of public sector employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>.
*   40% strongly believe it will lead to a more [[Digital transformation in public administration | digitally savvy]] public sector workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>.
*   Few expect new rounds of austerity, workforce reductions, or pay cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   Notably, almost no one believed things would return to the way they were before the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.

This optimistic outlook suggests that a more flexible and resilient public sector model is the future, but it requires continued effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

## Conclusion

The crisis has undeniably accelerated a more joined-up and collaborative public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. To sustain this, it needs to be normalized, embedded in governance arrangements, and supported by a culture where collaboration is expected and incentivized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>. The shift in public perception of public servants as "heroes in the crisis" who kept systems functioning should be celebrated and leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

Ultimately, the future of public employment is "all about the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>. This means investing in their skills, fostering a learning environment, supporting their well-being, and placing the right leaders who can build trust and communicate effectively in challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>. It also means recognizing that instability can happen, and public administration must be prepared with strong structures and skilled staff to face multifaceted threats, from climate crises to social instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. Leaders must also look after their own resilience, as it is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>.

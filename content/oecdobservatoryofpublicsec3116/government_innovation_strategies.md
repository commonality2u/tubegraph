Innovation within the public sector is crucial for addressing complex societal challenges and improving public outcomes. It involves not just novel ideas, but their effective implementation and measurable impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Defining Public Sector Innovation

The OPSI (Observatory of Public Sector Innovation) defines [[Public sector innovation]] as something that is:
*   **Novel or new to the context** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Implemented**, emphasizing action over mere ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   Designed to **have impact or shift public value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This means improving public services and citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. Even failures can be valuable if lessons are learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Why Innovation Matters: [[government_innovation_motivations | Motivations for Government Innovation]]

Governments need to innovate to remain relevant and effective in a rapidly changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Key [[government_innovation_motivations | motivations]] include:
*   **Keeping pace with change:** Moving from a reactive to a proactive stance, engaging with new technologies, opportunities, and approaches in contexts of uncertainty, volatility, and ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Building trust between governments and citizens:** Designing and delivering services that genuinely meet citizen needs, fostering trust regardless of circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Exploring uncertainty:** Using innovation as a resource to engage with possible futures and steer towards preferred outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Improving public value and outcomes:** Ultimately, governments aim to serve the people and enhance their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The cost of inaction is often much higher than the cost of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Types of [[innovation_strategies | Innovation Strategies]] (OPSI Innovation Facets)

The OPSI framework identifies different types of [[Public sector innovation strategies | innovation activities]] and how governments can support them systemically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

### Enhancement-Oriented Innovation
This type focuses on "quick wins" and "doing things better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. These are often incremental improvements that are easy to showcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Example:** Shifting to e-signatures or digital procedures in the Canadian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Systemic Improvement Example:** Estonia's proactive family benefit system, where the government identifies available services for new parents without them needing to apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

### Adaptive Innovation
Involves adapting to constantly changing circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This goes beyond simple adjustments out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   **Example:** The widespread shift to telework during the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   **Systemic Approach:** Japan's agile governance model is a constant cycle of understanding changing conditions and risks, setting new goals, developing and evaluating new systems, and adapting policies and service delivery approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

### Mission-Oriented Innovation
A strong approach for addressing difficult, complex challenges like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. It involves a wide range of stakeholders collectively defining problems, developing solutions, and understanding their impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Focus Areas:** European Commission missions include climate-neutral cities, healthy oceans, and adaptation to climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Key Elements:** Comprehensive coordination, collaborative mechanisms, collective long-term visions, institutional infrastructure, and supportive funding, procurement, and regulatory environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

### Anticipatory Innovation
An emerging field focused on engaging with uncertainty and working with the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. It seeks to create "evidence about the future in the present" to inform decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   **Method:** Uses tools like strategic foresight to explore potential futures and assess their implications for the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   **Example:** A report with the Government of Slovenia imagined four different future worlds (e.g., highly mobile elite, localized world, greater polarization, intergenerational interaction) to inform policy decisions for the public sector of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

## [[Public sector innovation methods and strategies | Government Innovation Practices]] and Building Blocks

Successful [[Public sector innovation methods and strategies | innovation strategies for governments]] involve a blend of approaches and sustained effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.

### Core Principles
*   **Innovation as a Means to an End:** Innovation is not the goal itself, but a tool to achieve better public outcomes and improve services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Commitment:** Building innovation infrastructure takes time and consistent work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
*   **Political Engagement:** Politicians are accountable for public sector productivity and services, making their inclusion and support for innovation agendas vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

### Key Practices
*   **Problem-Oriented Approach:** Focus on the specific problems that need solving, as this resonates well with politicians and senior managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>.
*   **User Involvement:** Strong emphasis on design thinking and user engagement in developing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.
*   **Collaboration Across Silos:** Essential for tackling complex problems that no single entity owns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **Decentral Autonomy:** Empowering smaller units or teams to innovate in areas where they have flexibility, even without massive funding or political decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.
*   **Building Networks and Communities:** Fostering a collective approach where innovators can share knowledge, experiences, and lessons learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.
    *   **Innovation Ambassadors:** Individuals who actively promote and implement innovative problem-solving within their institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
*   **Training and Knowledge Transfer:** Providing public administration employees with training programs to change their perspective on workflow, problem-solving, and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.
*   **Creating Safe Experimental Spaces:** Establishing environments where mistakes are allowed, encouraging experimentation and multi-level cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
    *   **"Free Municipality" Experiments (Denmark):** Municipalities are exempt from certain regulations to experiment and find new ways of working, with the aim of rolling out successful changes nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>. This creates a cultural mandate for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact:** Systematically measuring innovation maturity and progress helps demonstrate results and gain support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.
*   **Strategic Storytelling:** Focusing on the results and learnings of innovation rather than just the process, to gain buy-in from management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.
*   **Leveraging External Resources:** Utilizing funds like the European Social Fund to initiate projects and create jobs dedicated to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.
*   **Open Mindsets and Coalitions of the Willing:** Working with people who are open to new approaches and building trust, rather than expending energy on those resistant to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>.
*   **Aligning with Management Goals:** Connecting [[innovation strategies | innovation initiatives]] with the stated objectives and management plans of senior leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

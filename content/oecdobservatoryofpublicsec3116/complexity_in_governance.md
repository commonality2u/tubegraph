[[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | Complexity]] and uncertainty are recurring themes in current global discussions, particularly concerning governance. The COVID-19 crisis highlighted the urgent need for governments to anticipate, experiment, and explore [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | systemic solutions]] to emerging and existing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The crisis has opened a "window of opportunity" for policy options not previously considered, allowing for different approaches and new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Understanding Complex Adaptive Systems

Systems such as culture, market, regulation, and the physical environment interact as [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | complex adaptive systems]] and are in continuous co-evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This dynamic nature inherently introduces uncertainty, making innovation an uncertain process with unpredictable outcomes and potentially long scale-up times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

One of the first steps in navigating complexity is to accept that we live in a [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | complex adaptive system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. In such systems, speed is of the essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. While challenging, "points of leverage" can be found within these systems, such as through distribution, subsidiarity, and cooperation among diverse actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.

## Approaches to Governing Complexity

Several methods and approaches are crucial for governments to become more anticipatory and transformative in the face of complexity:

*   **Anticipation and Futures Thinking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>: This is seen as a leading method to adopt beyond the crisis. It involves asking questions about plausible futures to inform actions in the present that can shape desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. The challenge, however, is that foresight often lacks traction because scenarios are not directly translated into present-day decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>.
*   **Agile and Adaptive Working Methods** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>: Essential for responding quickly to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This includes moving to remote work and adopting mission-based approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **[[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | Systems Approaches]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>: Understanding and influencing the system as a whole. This includes recognizing "system archetypes" where causality between interactions and actors can be understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. Breaking down larger complex systems into smaller, understandable parts can help identify leverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.
*   **Goal-Based Regulation**: In a fast-changing society driven by [[Governance and Technology Interaction | cyber-physical systems]], traditional rule-based regulations are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. Goal-based regulations offer more room for innovative methods to achieve regulatory objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Defining the goals is difficult, as it involves balancing competing values (e.g., privacy vs. efficiency in contact tracing apps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. The "right" goal can also change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.
    *   **Implementation**: Requires continuous discussion among multi-stakeholders to define goals, implementation of technologies, and assessment of satisfaction with initial goals, allowing for iterative refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
    *   **Learning Systems**: Goal-based regulations should be learning systems. Governments should monitor whether goals are achieved and provide appropriate standards or guidelines developed through a multi-stakeholder approach. Collaborative enforcement mechanisms, like deferred prosecution agreements, can incentivize businesses to disclose information and cooperate, fostering learning within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>.
*   **Mission-Oriented Approaches**: These aim to bridge the gap between long-term goals (e.g., decarbonization) and actionable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>. They create clear, visible missions that many can support, articulate step-by-step approaches, and foster coordination among different agencies to achieve longer-term goals and promote innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>.
*   **Robust Portfolios of Options**: Given multiple plausible futures, the aim is to identify a set of actions that would work across different scenarios. This involves seeking "co-benefits" or "multiple dividends" where a single action can be beneficial even if an alternative future materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

## Key Considerations for [[Future governance and leadership | Future Governance]]

*   **Mindset Shift**: A critical change in mindset is needed to embrace deep uncertainty, recognizing that the future may be radically different from the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
*   **Role of Science**: The role of science in society needs to be elevated. This requires scientists to better communicate their work and policymakers/the public to better perceive and utilize scientific input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>. A true partnership between science, policy, and the public is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.
*   **Inter/Transdisciplinary Research**: Multi-dimensional crises necessitate interdisciplinary research and, furthermore, transdisciplinary research that crosses boundaries between science and other social and political spheres to bridge the gap between knowledge and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.
*   **Private-Public Sector Linkage**: Fostering collaboration between academic and private sector science is vital, as the private sector holds significant potential solutions and useful knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
*   **Agility of Science System**: Accelerating the dissemination of scientific knowledge to policy circles and the public is critically important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.
*   **Stable Institutions**: Supporting and maintaining stable, robust institutions that deal with risk (e.g., epidemiology, public health) is crucial, avoiding defunding before crises hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **International Cooperation**: Global scientific networks and cooperation are paramount, especially for developing countries that may lack sufficient scientific capacity but can leverage these networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Analysis**: Governments often lack a clear understanding of their existing innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. Regularly assessing innovation portfolios helps determine relevance and reallocate resources, as demonstrated by EIT's swift crisis response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.
*   **[[Public trust and governance | Public Pressure]]**: A lack of [[Public trust and governance | public pressure]] around crisis management, especially for probabilistic dangers, can contribute to inaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Engaging diverse communities in foresight processes can enroll more people in recognizing potential problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Structural Barriers**: Traditional government structures, such as rigid budget cycles and short political cycles, make it difficult to implement long-term strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>. Making foresight exercises beneficial and engaging for participants, perhaps through social learning or "gamified" approaches, can increase their impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.
*   **[[Governance and Technology Interaction | Co-evolution of Technology and Society]]**: Technology is not a deterministic force; rather, it co-evolves with societal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. [[future_oriented_governance | Anticipatory governance]] in technology involves upstream participatory elements, engaging stakeholders in technology development to shape it in line with societal values, beyond purely market influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. Examples include "living laboratories" where regulation and technology are co-developed (e.g., autonomous vehicles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

Ultimately, while we cannot "get out of" complexity, successful navigation involves continuous learning, adaptation, and collaboration across sectors and borders. The crisis has provided an opportunity to study and understand new models of cooperation in science, technology, and innovation, which can be applied to other complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

The event highlighted key global trends and case studies in [[innovation_and_digital_transformation_in_public_services | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A core focus was the [[role_of_technology_in_improving_government_services | role of technology]] and the importance of [[digital_advancements_and_accessibility_challenges_in_public_innovation | AI literacy]] in public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.

## Key Trends in Government Innovation

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation (MBRCGI) collaborate to identify key trends and case studies in public sector innovation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. In 2020, based on 683 cases from 91 countries and 450 cases from the COVID-19 Innovative Response Tracker, five key trends in government innovation were identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>:

1.  **Innovative Responses to the COVID-19 Crisis**
    Governments rapidly acted under exceptional circumstances, demonstrating the ability to innovate in crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

2.  **Seamless Government**
    This concept aims to eliminate points of friction between government machinery and the public they serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

3.  **Focusing on the Overlooked**
    Innovation can address the needs of societal segments at risk of falling through the cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

4.  **Balancing Technology and Rights**
    Governments face tensions when using powerful new technologies that provide insights while mitigating harm to freedom and rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

5.  **Upskilling and Investing in the Public**
    This trend explores how governments innovatively invest in and upskill both the public and public service personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Case Studies and Exemplary Innovations

### The Ministry of Possibilities (UAE)
The Ministry of Possibilities is a virtual ministry in the UAE, created in 2017 to incubate and solve systemic challenges and "impossibilities" hindering government progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. It operates as a neutral space, close to the core of government yet removed from traditional bureaucratic mandates that limit bold thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

*   **Structure and Methodologies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>:
    *   No single active minister; relies on time-bound departments.
    *   Each department focuses on a "wicked question" or priority national portfolio.
    *   Applies design thinking and experimentation to develop proactive, disruptive solutions.
    *   Brings together federal, local government teams, the private sector, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Mission Pillars** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>:
    *   Identify "Impossibles."
    *   Incubate virtual time-bound departments to solve and explore these impossibilities.
    *   Educate and train individuals on a mindset of design and experimentation in government.
    *   Inspire other governments with the UAE methodology of possibilities.
*   **Challenges and Lessons** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>:
    *   Initiating projects with unknown solutions in an environment accustomed to certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
    *   Difficulty for team members to adapt to agile, continuous iteration based on user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
    *   Importance of a common understanding of the "impossible" and dedicated teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
    *   Patience is key, as resistance to new approaches is expected when challenging existing beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

### Hack the Crisis (Estonia)

*   **Empowering Employees through Learning by Doing:** Providing a safe zone and legal permission for teams to experiment and pilot new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>. The Ministry of Possibilities operates with the value: "Protect those who try" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Leadership Buy-in:** Strong support from leadership, particularly at the cabinet level, helps create space and overcome resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.
*   **Clear Value Proposition:** Explaining the clear value and impact of innovation can bring all stakeholders—citizens, private sector, and government entities—on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.
*   **Second Opinions and Systemic Thinking:** When told something is impossible, seek alternative interpretations of laws or find new ways through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>. Innovation labs should look beyond redesigning services to address systemic errors that cause them to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **Shared Ownership:** Make all stakeholders owners of the problem, fostering a collective desire to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.

### Leveraging Innovative Momentum in 2021

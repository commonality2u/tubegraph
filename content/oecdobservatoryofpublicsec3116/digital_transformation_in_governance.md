The current period presents a critical moment for organizing the future of governance, offering an opportunity to reshape public administration [00:03:22]. After two decades marked by financial and COVID-19 crises, public administration in many countries and regions has become weaker, with limited possibilities for renewal, improvement, or training [00:03:51]. Despite this, new, strong funding is available to boost recovery, focusing on [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]], greening, and a more cohesive approach [00:04:47].

This dual challenge of a weakened public sector skeleton and new demands also presents opportunities, supported by new financial and technical instruments such as the European Technical Support Instrument and Recovery and Resilience Plans, which can facilitate the reshaping and reorganization of civil services [00:05:16].

## Key Lessons and Opportunities for Future Governance

### Lessons from the Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated existing trends in government [00:16:45] and highlighted several critical lessons for future-oriented governance:
*   **Whole-of-Government Approach** Governments need to operate horizontally, moving away from siloed programs, budgets, and organizational structures [00:17:01]. For instance, policies on the future of work cannot solely consider telework in one place and real estate in another [00:17:16]. This requires central governments to possess the right skills and capabilities for cross-agency coordination [00:17:31].
*   **Vertical Optimization and Feedback Mechanisms** Historically, the focus has been on top-down compliance [00:18:05]. The future of government necessitates listening to frontline experiences and creating feedback mechanisms that make this information available to senior leadership [00:18:18]. An example of a new capability developed during the pandemic is the U.S. government-wide pulse survey, a brief, three-question survey for nearly two million employees, designed to understand workforce experiences during challenging times [00:18:46].
*   **Adapting Policy-Making and Implementation Routines** Governments must assess if their policy-making and implementation routines allow for sufficient adaptation based on the experiences of the workforce, managers, and the public [00:19:42]. Annual review cycles may not be agile enough for the fluid nature of current challenges [00:20:06]. This also extends to fostering international partnerships, as global problems transcend organizational boundaries [00:20:28].

### Surge in Innovation and Future Capacity Building
The pandemic led to a significant surge in innovation within governments [00:23:22]. This included:
*   Increased uptake of [[digital_transformation_and_egovernment | digital government]] [00:23:27].
*   Rapid reskilling and reallocation of public servants to urgent tasks [00:23:29].
*   A dramatic rise in teleworking among civil servants across OECD countries [00:23:36].
*   Greater openness of governments to ideas from the third sector to ensure service continuity [00:23:44].

This innovative momentum needs to be systematically carried forward to build the public service's capacity to respond to future challenges, particularly climate change [00:23:53]. Discussions have focused on designing ambitious missions for the climate crisis [00:24:23], using foresight for public sector skill development [00:24:34], pushing innovation beyond administrative boundaries, and enhancing cross-border collaboration for global challenges [00:24:48].

## Addressing Challenges in [[digital_transformation_in_government | Digital Transformation]] and Inclusion

### Fear of Inaction and Short-Termism
A poll conducted during the conference revealed that while the audience is highly committed to implementing learned practices [00:26:01], there are significant concerns about governments taking concrete action. 50% of respondents believe lessons are learned but no concrete action will be taken, and 17.5% think governments will revert to the "old normal" [00:26:42]. This highlights a fear that governments, often prone to "short-termism," may not adequately address long-term problems like the climate crisis, unlike immediate challenges like COVID-19 [00:27:39].

### Ensuring Inclusivity in [[digital_transformation_in_government | Digital Transformation]]
[[digital_transformation_in_government | Digital transformation]] is central to the future agenda [00:34:25], but it requires more than just replicating old bureaucratic systems electronically; it demands a complete reshaping of administrative management [00:34:55]. A critical challenge is preventing a "digital divide" where segments of the population or certain regions are cut off from basic public services due to location, capacity, or educational barriers [00:35:34]. This requires careful, detailed, and place-based approaches to ensure that demographic factors like age, geographical location, or social belonging do not dictate access to public services [00:53:17].

### Valuing the Public Sector Workforce
One crucial aspect of successful governance and [[adapting_public_administration_for_digital_transformation | adapting public administration for digital transformation]] is recognizing the vital role of the public sector workforce [00:39:45]. During crises, their importance is evident, but this recognition must extend to day-to-day operations [00:39:56]. Governments must treat their workforce as their most important asset, consistently supporting them as they interact directly with citizens across a variety of services [00:40:05].

## Moving Forward: Commitment and Collaboration
The COVID-19 recovery provides a unique opportunity to improve policy development, including more inclusive citizen involvement [00:58:17]. Investing in innovation within governments is crucial to foresee and respond to complex global challenges [00:58:43]. The crisis has redefined what is possible in public policy, and these hard-learned lessons must now be applied to other pressing issues like the climate crisis and [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]] [00:59:11].

Governments must prioritize "governing differently" to avoid reverting to old norms and to shape a future with equal opportunities, leveraging [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]] for the benefit of all [00:59:54]. International cooperation and the exchange of know-how are essential [00:46:04]. The European Commission, for example, provides technical support to member states and explores horizontal programs to exchange experiences and even civil servants to foster a common culture of public administration improvement [00:50:55].

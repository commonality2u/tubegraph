Innovation processes benefit significantly from [[Ethics and Diversity in Public Sector Innovation | diversity]] within teams, as it directly impacts creativity and the quality of generated ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Combating Groupthink

A major obstacle to [[Challenges in implementing innovation | innovation]] and ideation in the public sector is groupthink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. When team members spend too much time together without external interaction or [[Ethics and Diversity in Public Sector Innovation | diversity]], they tend to think alike and develop the same vocabulary and appreciation for similar ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This lack of varied input leads to the "death of creativity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>.

To counteract groupthink and foster creativity:
*   **Expand Experiences and Backgrounds** Bringing together people with different experiences and backgrounds for ideation and problem discussion is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   **Constructive Conflict** Diverse perspectives can introduce constructive conflict, which leads to more creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This requires a safe environment where disagreements are professional and not personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>.
*   **Team Rotation** Rotating people within teams periodically can help counter the tendency for groupthink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

## Diverse Thinking and Creativity

Creativity is a resource that needs to be actively created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. While some individuals are naturally more "out-of-the-box" thinkers, creativity often emerges when people come together in teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. For example, confronting someone with a background different from one's own (e.g., an architect interacting with an economist) can challenge existing thought patterns and foster greater creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

In the public sector, fostering creativity involves:
*   **Involving Diverse Stakeholders** Engaging people who think differently and have different experiences, including representatives of the target population, can lead to more creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
*   **Encouraging Different Working Styles** Ideation strategies should accommodate various working styles, not just extroverted, fast-paced environments. Individuals who are not quick thinkers should have time to develop creative ideas in a method that suits them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.
*   **Exposure to Diverse Information** Reading a diverse set of materials challenges assumptions and broadens understanding of what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Direct Engagement** Rather than relying solely on degrees or years of experience, direct engagement with the problem and interaction with citizens who have lived experiences of the issues being addressed can significantly broaden perspectives and generate new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

The goal is to ensure a group is not composed of many people from the same background, with the same education level, or the same lived experiences, as this hinders effective problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. Strong [[Ethics and Diversity in Public Sector Innovation | diversity]] is essential for generating innovative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.

The [[Impact of COVID19 on global cooperation | COVID-19 pandemic]] and its consequences are expected to increase poverty and drive further inequality worldwide, as highlighted in recent OECD reports like the *States of Fragility* and the *Global Outlook on Financing for Sustainable Development* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This global crisis necessitates drawing lessons to promote innovation that benefits the poorest and most vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Innovation Potential During Crisis

A poll conducted during a session on innovation in the developing world revealed strong agreement that innovations can provide an effective response to the challenge of "leaving no one behind," with 88% of participants agreeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. However, a significant majority (61% disagree, 19% strongly disagree) indicated that governments and their partners are *not* doing enough to enable [[Public sector innovation during Covid19 | innovation]] for [[impact_of_covid19_on_sustainable_development_goals | sustainable development]] in light of the [[Impact of Covid19 on public governance and policy | COVID-19 crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, suggesting a huge unmet need for innovation to foster change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## Role of Governments in Fostering Innovation

Governments play a critical role in creating an enabling local environment for successful innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This involves:

*   **Nurturing and Facilitating** Instead of controlling, governments should "steer" rather than "row," allowing others to do the innovative "rowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Creating Ecosystems** Governments can foster ecosystems where innovation thrives by supporting:
    *   **Variation**: People trying out experiments and "crazy things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
    *   **Selection and Scaling**: Mechanisms to select promising ideas (often called "positive deviance") and provide resources to scale them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
*   **Practical Examples**:
    *   Malaysia's Global Innovation Center creates an "innovation sandbox" with funding and mentorship for local innovators, including matching grants for social enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This approach extends regionally within ASEAN to penetrate new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
    *   Digital platforms can connect innovators with those who can help scale solutions, as seen with USAID's Million Lives Club and the Commonwealth Secretariat's platform during COVID-19 for smaller nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
    *   Governments can offer incentives and disincentives to the private sector to encourage participation in nation-building and citizen welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.

## Frugal Innovation in Crisis Response

[[Resilience and innovation in pandemic response | Frugal innovation]] is defined as "doing more and better for more people with less resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. It's about using existing resources to substitute for what's lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>, providing highly affordable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. The pandemic has highlighted its relevance:

*   **Prevention**: Maker spaces in India quickly produced face masks from available materials, including repurposed transparency sheets, for frontline workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
*   **Care**: Train compartments in countries like India, Pakistan, and France were repurposed into mobile wards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>, and pop-up hospitals emerged in stadia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Cure**: Doctors repurposed existing, cheap drugs like Dexamethasone to treat COVID symptoms effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

## What is Working and Not Working in Innovation Response

Many things are working, including a global outpouring of creativity to face unprecedented challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. Open innovation calls (e.g., World Economic Forum, OpenIDEO) have surfaced compelling and frugal approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. Standardized criteria, like USAID's Global Health Innovation Index, help evaluate innovations based on health impact, demand, organizational capability, and progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

However, significant constraints hinder innovation:
*   **Deployment Barriers**: Navigating regulatory hurdles, behavior change, and stakeholder coordination for deployment and scaling is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Funding Shortfalls**: The economic recession has led to enormous outflows of private capital and foreign direct investment from low- and middle-income countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **Supply Chain and Infrastructure**: Issues like establishing cold chains for vaccines in remote areas without electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>, and underdeveloped logistics infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide**: Lack of internet access in some regions widens the socio-economic gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

## Strategies for Better Innovation Development

To improve, focus on:
*   **Repurposing**: Leveraging existing capabilities like manufacturers who can make masks or other PPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. Examples include two-way communication platforms like mHero, initially funded during the Ebola outbreak, now used for COVID-19 information dissemination in Liberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Cheaper, More Effective Services**: Innovations like Drip Assist, an IV infusion rate monitor, cost a tenth of typical pumps, run on a single battery, and require minimal training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Multi-sectoral Needs**: Innovation is needed across health, humanitarian, development, and financial sectors due to their interconnected impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. This includes addressing the environmental impact of PPE by developing biodegradable alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
*   **Repurposing Financial Instruments**: Experimenting with new financing models like Islamic social financing (e.g., *sukuk* model, Islamic bonds) to empower local women and communities for livelihood development and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.
*   **Local and Sub-national Approaches**: Many innovations should be very local and hyper-contextualized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Initiatives like Project Last Mile in South Africa work at a sub-national level to enable local manufacturers to produce textile masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
*   **Addressing Mental Health**: Utilizing technology to reach frontline workers and provide psychological first aid and mental health support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.
*   **Strategic Partnerships**: Fostering collaboration between governments, civil society, communities, and the private sector to utilize expertise and resources, localizing efforts to specific needs, and scaling where possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. This includes public-private partnerships, such as pooled logistics resources using tourist buses and vans for healthcare worker transportation in remote areas of Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

## Role of the International Community and Private Sector

The international community needs to focus on innovations that benefit the poorest and reduce inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>.

*   **Investing in Localization**: Donors should invest in supporting local structures that drive innovation, as local innovations often cost less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. This requires taking more risks, which donors are often reluctant to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.
*   **Regional Approach**: Investing in regional initiatives, like an ASEAN CDC, to pool resources, research, and innovation pertinent to unique regional attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.
*   **Curating Global Ideas for Local Needs**: Donor partners can curate and bring the best global innovations to specific country contexts based on their priorities and constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.
*   **Innovative Financing**: Blending different types of capital, such as patient grant capital with return-seeking investment capital, to lower risk for investors and grow the resourcing pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.
*   **Private Sector Transformation**: Traditional private sector innovation, often characterized by expensive R&D and high margins for affluent customers, needs to shift towards "frugal innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. This means accepting wafer-thin margins but reaching large numbers of people with affordable solutions, which can still be highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. Large companies should partner with agile startups to scale ideas, as seen with Pfizer partnering with a German biotech company for vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sectoral Thinking**: The crisis revealed the need to look beyond traditional silos in the development sector and address interconnected issues, such as the spillover effects of COVID-19 on malaria, HIV management, economic impacts, and livelihoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>.
*   **Diversity and Inclusion**: Actively encouraging and enabling female and locally based innovators who might not be on the international radar, broadening the conversation to foster a more inclusive innovation environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

The crisis has shed light on the potential of innovation that was previously underused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. Development cooperation plays a vital role in fostering [[Innovation strategies during COVID19 recovery | innovation]], requiring closer partnerships with stakeholders in partner countries to support local solutions <a class="yt=" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>.

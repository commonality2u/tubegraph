[[Public Sector Innovation | Public sector innovation]] is crucial for governments to tackle policy challenges effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This concept has been actively supported by the European Commission, which, since 2013, has invested in internal innovation efforts within governments, leading to significant developments such as the establishment of the OPSY platform, the adoption of the Declaration for [[Public Sector Innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] in 2019, and the setting up of a Mission Action Lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The OPSY platform showcases case studies and offers a toolkit navigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Definition and Purpose
[[Mission oriented innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] involves designing missions that engage all actors within an innovation ecosystem in "game-changing common endeavors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. It is about setting long-term transformational goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The public sector requires [[Mission oriented innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] to address new and complex challenges, providing directionality and clear goals that public sector organizations must deliver on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This approach tasks public sector leadership and politicians with committing to ambitious, targeted, and time-bound challenges that can instigate purpose-driven or systematic transformative change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

## Implementation and Practices
The European Commission has pioneered [[Mission oriented innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] through the design of five missions under its Horizon Europe program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. These missions are ambitious, with clear targets until 2030, covering areas such as fighting cancer, adapting to climate change, protecting oceans, creating greener cities, and ensuring healthy soil and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.

To effectively implement [[Mission oriented innovation | missions]], it's crucial to have institutional and entrepreneurial funding models, as well as robust governance tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:17">[01:19:17]</a>. While establishing missions is understood, the practical "doing part" requires further support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>.

### Country Examples:

*   **South Korea**: [[Mission oriented innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] and [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] are critical for government reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. These approaches aim to improve governmental accountability, social inclusiveness, open government, and digital government, utilizing data, technologies, and social media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. They also strengthen ties between public and private sectors, extend partnerships with civil society organizations, and encourage clear business cases, experimental, and entrepreneurial approaches for sustained funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.
*   **Austria**: The project "Greening Commutes and Duty Travels" is classified as [[Mission oriented innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. Its goals include avoiding unnecessary duty travels and commutes, shifting to environmentally friendly transport, and improving individual transport options with e-mobility and bicycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.

### Challenges and Considerations
Implementing [[Mission oriented innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] in public administration presents several challenges:

*   **Organizational Adaptation**: While there's extensive experimentation with missions as policy, there's less focus on whether these policies necessitate [[Mission oriented innovation | mission-oriented organizations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Existing organizations may not be equipped with the specific capabilities needed for this approach, highlighting the need for greater attention to organizational setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Orchestration**: Modern missions require galvanizing the entire ecosystem to work towards a common direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. Public sector organizations are often not well-equipped for this, particularly regarding engagement and stakeholder management due to concerns about favoritism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. This requires specific skills and is an important emerging topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>. The European Commission acknowledges that missions require hands-on, close collaboration with [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_organizations | innovation ecosystem players]], which is a significant challenge for administrations accustomed to a consultation culture rather than co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>.
*   **Bureaucratic Environment**: In large administrations like the European Commission, missions can be removed from a "safe experimental space" and subject to burdensome decision-making rules and procedures, making management more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Top-down political design of missions also makes deep engagement with industry, business, and civil society partners more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Capabilities**: The current era of "perma-crisis" (health, energy, climate, geopolitical dependencies) and fiscal constraints necessitates [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] as a must for the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This means developing dynamic capabilities within the public sector to proactively shape responses to crises, which requires more investment in HR and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>.
*   **Funding for Internal Capacity**: Often, funding is directed towards [[Mission oriented innovation | mission-oriented projects]] but not towards developing the organization's own internal capabilities to deliver on these missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

## Strategic Approach
A long-term strategic approach is necessary to bridge political cycles and prevent governments from being stuck in reactive modes or only making incremental improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This involves a "step change" in working methods, embracing flexibility, digitization, and hybrid models, and fostering collaboration with citizens and innovation system actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>.

The ability to innovate is core to government effectiveness and stability, especially in turbulent times and when facing complex, interrelated challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Governments need to be more agile, anticipatory, and capable of guiding their missions and main goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Portfolio Approach
The report advocates for a portfolio approach to [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This approach helps in balancing different types of innovation (e.g., [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented]], [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive]], [[Mission oriented innovation | mission-oriented]], and [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]]), avoiding lock-in, distributing responsibilities, coordinating knowledge, and tailoring projects to manage risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. It moves beyond single projects to manage risks across public sector activities and generate synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This strategic investment mentality, akin to venture government, explores both risk and [[innovative_public_administration_practices | innovation areas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

The OPSY has developed tools like the "portfolio explanation tool" and the "portfolio mapper tool" to help organizations visualize and balance their [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] portfolios, identify opportunities, and make strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

A "big bang moment" for adopting a portfolio approach can involve:
*   **Sense-making**: Gaining a clear understanding of current activities, their relation to the organization's mission, and identifying gaps in resources or capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>.
*   **Diversity in Sense-making**: Encouraging different approaches to understanding problems, as organizations often have a monolithic view based on their predominant expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:54">[01:28:54]</a>. Dedicating time for staff to learn new sense-making approaches can foster diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>.
*   **Design Tools**: Utilizing design tools to create design briefs for portfolios, guiding decisions on future positioning and activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>.

## Impact
[[Public Sector Innovation | Innovation in the public sector]] improves lives by increasing agility and responsiveness, enhancing public value, improving service quality for citizens, and achieving better spending, especially during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. It is core to restoring trust in government and democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

The OPSI has successfully opened up typically cautious government contexts to share experiences on [[Public Sector Innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This includes raising sensitive issues like the relationship between political leaders and the civil service, and the framework conditions for supporting innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The most impactful result has been the shift from merely listing innovations to implementing concrete actions like innovation weeks, trainings, and prizes, thereby influencing the core business of government and policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

[[Foresight and Scenario Planning | Strategic foresight]] is defined as the ability to constantly perceive, make sense of, and act on the future in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Its primary purpose is not to predict the future, but to facilitate better decision-making in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This is achieved by utilizing various foresight products, such as forecasts and scenarios, to ensure decisions are well-prepared and current actions are future-proofed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Core Benefits and Applications
[[Role of Foresight in Policymaking | Strategic foresight]] offers a structured, participatory, inclusive, and systemic approach to understanding future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It typically addresses the medium to long-term future, but can adapt to volatile areas where the "medium-term" might be a matter of months, as seen in the fields of artificial intelligence or during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Key benefits include:
*   **Priority Setting and Policy Steering** It helps guide policies and set priorities based on long-term objectives and planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Identifying Challenges and Opportunities** [[Strategic foresight for future global challenges | It enables the identification of emerging challenges and opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **[[Anticipatory innovation and foresight | Investment in Innovative Solutions]]** It guides decisions on which types of innovations to explore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Stress Testing and Future-Proofing** It helps stress test current decisions, policies, and approaches to ensure they are robust for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Building Shared Visions** It can assist in building collective visions and success stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Key Functions and Methods

The OECD and the Government of Flanders have developed a blueprint that outlines four key functions for embedding [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_organization_and_governance | strategic foresight]] within an organization:

### 1. Discover
This initial function focuses on identifying emerging trends and weak signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. It requires dedicated time and skilled personnel with the mandate to conduct this analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### 2. Explore
Building on the discovery phase, exploration involves making sense of the insights gathered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Horizon Scanning** is a key tool used to identify patterns and system analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Science-to-policy dialogues** are effective means of integrating intelligence into governmental policymaking, especially during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Example: "Science to Policy" in Flanders (2022)**
    *   This initiative brought together scientists and policymakers across five teams to understand challenges and opportunities, providing leverage points for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
    *   It facilitated knowledge exchange and allowed young researchers to participate in science-to-policy engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
    *   Outcomes were communicated through a Flemish journal for government management, demonstrating the importance of dedicated communication channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

### 3. Map
This function focuses on connecting the gathered intelligence with current policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, mapping opportunities and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   **Explorative Scenarios** and **Futures Wheels** are common tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Resilient Indicators** involve using statistical data to understand future potential and map weaknesses, moving beyond a snapshot of the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
*   **Example: "Scenarios for a Resilient Europe"**
    *   Initiated in 2023 with 10 European regions, this project analyzed mega-trends to build a scenario framework featuring four distinct scenarios: Smart Optimism, Hyper Competition, Silver Spheres, and Urban Flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
    *   [[Foresight and Scenario Planning | Horizon scanning]] using a digital platform (e.g., Futuras Platform) underpinned these scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
    *   Videos were created to immerse participants in these future worlds during scenario workshops, allowing for the exploration of common challenges and potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. This multi-level perspective also enabled collaboration with EU institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

### 4. Create
The final function focuses on impact and scale, translating insights into actionable strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Creating Visions and Roadmaps** are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   **Building Coalitions for the Future** is crucial, especially during crises, to ensure governments and stakeholders can work together on recovery and building resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

## [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_organization_and_governance | Integrating Strategic Foresight]] in Practice
[[Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | Integrating strategic foresight]] effectively into government systems involves several considerations:

*   **Governance System**: Building a robust governance system is key to using strategic foresight effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This includes engaging with uncertainty, ensuring continuity across policy cycles, and leveraging transformative innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Capabilities**: Effective approaches require strong leadership, knowledge, and capabilities in strategic foresight, intelligence sense-making, governance structures, and coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Collaboration**: Foresight inherently involves crossing boundaries of time, policy domains, and actors. This necessitates [[Collaborative approaches in foresight | working with different government bodies]], academia, EU institutions, and other promising initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Informed Policymaking**: To impact policymaking, it's crucial that findings are taken seriously. In Estonia, the Foresight Center informs the Parliament and the public about alternative scenarios, future risks, and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. This is achieved by:
    *   **Proactive Media Engagement**: Using media to amplify messages, as policymakers tend to take insights more seriously when reported by journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.
    *   **Quantifiable Data**: Combining foresight methods with traditional analysis to provide numbers and hypothetical simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. Budgetary impact is a particularly instrumental hook for engaging parliament members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.
*   **Legislative Mandate**: In Wales, the "Well-being of Future Generations Act" (2015) created legal duties for long-term planning, including a requirement to publish a Future Trends Report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. This report curates information for different audiences (infographics, summaries, evidence packs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.
    *   Foresight is integrated into government systems through logical entry points, such as central impact assessments, procurement and grants processes, corporate learning and development, and regional plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.
    *   The aim is to empower colleagues with foresight tools rather than conducting all the work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.
    *   Tangible changes include key government strategies shifting to a longer-term focus (e.g., transport, development, waste strategies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>.
    *   The development of a Wales Futures Hub, a coalition across the Welsh Public Service, aims to pool resources, diversify perspectives, and provide constructive challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.
*   **[[Anticipatory innovation and foresight | Informing Transformative Innovation]]**: Organizations like Nesta use strategic foresight to inform transformative innovation:
    *   **Horizon Scanning**: To understand the impact of emerging technology and social change on strategy (e.g., Future Signals series, Minister for the Future essay series) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.
    *   **Stress Testing and Big Questions**: Projects that answer critical questions for missions, such as future home heating models or learning from international obesity policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.
    *   **Novel Approaches**: Blending methodologies like data science, qualitative research, and design with traditional foresight techniques (e.g., Innovation Sweet Spots program combining foresight with open data sets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.
    *   **Speculating and Prototyping**: Exploring potential applications of new technologies, such as generative AI in early years education, or alternative uses for existing infrastructure (e.g., UK's gas grid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.
    *   **Staff Exposure and Exploration Space**: Bringing in external perspectives through discovery months or expert residencies, and creating internal programs like sabbaticals and "Exploration Week" to foster experimental and self-directed work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Directions

Despite the growing adoption of strategic foresight, several barriers persist:
*   **Time, Silos, and Workload**: Government officials often lack the time for discovery and cross-domain collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.
*   **Budget and Resources**: Financial constraints and lack of dedicated capacity are significant hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.
*   **Short-term Thinking**: A prevalent focus on immediate results hinders long-term planning and investment in anticipatory intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.
*   **Impact Gap**: In Finland, despite many strategic foresight assets (e.g., Committee for the Future, Citra, Innovation Labs), there's an "impact gap" between these activities and core government processes like budgeting and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>.
*   **Project-based vs. Structural Mandate**: Foresight is often implemented as fragmented projects rather than a structural mandate within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.

To overcome these challenges, efforts are focused on:
*   **Embedding Anticipation in Policy Cycles**: [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_organization_and_governance | Integrating foresight]] into everyday policy cycles, fostering dialogue between specialists, policymakers, and decision-makers to inform strategic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>. This can lead to greater policy coherence, better budgeting, and more impactful innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Approach**: Moving beyond focusing on a "super team" to thinking in terms of a broader ecosystem that nurtures itself, encompassing culture, behavior, processes, structures, and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Empowering Practitioners**: Providing tools and methods to empower individuals to explore foresight themselves, rather than relying solely on external experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.
*   **Demonstrating Value**: Engaging stakeholders by getting them involved in foresight tools, even on hypothetical topics, to demonstrate their practical utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>.

## Measuring Impact
[[Measuring the impact of strategic foresight in decision making | Measuring the impact of strategic foresight]] is challenging due to the lack of clear-cut metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>. However, impact can be observed by:
*   **Message Diffusion**: Tracking how widely the foresight message spreads among policy designers and in public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>.
*   **Realization and Action**: When policymakers and the public realize the issue and acknowledge the need for action, particularly at key intervention points identified by foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.
*   **Setting Thresholds/Milestones**: Establishing specific goals, such as a certain number of key policy persons recognizing an issue and committing to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>.

Rules as Code is an innovative concept that re-thinks the core government function of rulemaking [00:03:31]. It involves creating an official version of rules in a machine-consumable form, enabling computer systems to understand and act upon them consistently [00:03:42]. This approach moves beyond traditional communication to humans and natural language versions of rules [00:03:49].

## Context and Importance

The concept of Rules as Code is at the heart of public debate, especially in the current context of rapid digital transformation and accelerated ongoing trends [00:05:10]. It is explored in the "Cracking the Code: Rulemaking for Humans and Machines" primer launched by the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) [00:01:19]. OPSI's mission includes helping governments uncover what's next and considering its implications for public sector innovation [00:00:45]. This primer is the third in a series designed to provide a clear introduction to emerging technologies or approaches relevant to the public service [00:18:37].

If adopted at scale, Rules as Code could significantly change how governments create, diffuse, and enforce rules, leading to improved compliance [00:04:26]. It can enhance policy modeling by governments and make it easier for people to understand their rights and obligations [00:04:45].

## Defining Rules as Code

The primer explores two main ways Rules as Code has been conceptualized:

*   **As an Output**: Refers to a coded version of rules that can be understood and used by computers [00:21:37]. Coded rules already exist today, created by businesses, individuals, and governments based on natural language versions to inform various business systems (e.g., online tax return platforms) [00:21:47].
*   **As an Approach**: Characterized as strategic, deliberate, and systemic [00:22:17]. This approach involves conceiving and creating machine-consumable rules from the outset of their creation [00:22:25]. This is the version that is believed to change the "when, what, why, and how" rules are made and for whom [00:22:39].

## Benefits and Opportunities

The implementation of Rules as Code presents several key opportunities:

*   **Improved Rule Quality**: It necessitates better rules that are reformed holistically, easier to implement, and consistently interpretable [00:32:41]. This addresses the "translation gap" where legislation is misinterpreted or implemented inconsistently, leading to substantial issues [00:31:26]. There is a significant cost to implement legislation and policy due to reliance on lawyers as "very expensive and quite variable modems" [00:32:12].
*   **Adaptation to Digital Paradigms**: Policies need to be developed by multi-disciplinary teams including policy people, legislators, service designers, technologists, and end-users, to ensure rules are fit for purpose in a modern, complex world [00:32:47]. This allows for rapid, agile, and test-driven policy development [00:34:13].
*   **Regulation of Machines**: In a world where machines are increasingly actors and users, Rules as Code enables shaping society and economy not just through human behavior, but also by regulating non-human entities [00:34:38]. Machines are not responsive to traditional legal, financial, or criminal pressures [00:35:03]. This approach facilitates designing new security, monitoring, and intervention paradigms suitable for the 21st century [00:35:18].
*   **Better Futures Design**: By creating legislation available as code, especially for service delivery and regulation, governments can have higher confidence, better automation, and improved testing capabilities [00:37:45]. This allows for monitoring patterns of usage and detecting unexpected spikes [00:38:10].
*   **Policy Transformation**: Rules as Code is a small part of a broader, necessary shift towards policy transformation [00:38:34]. It advocates for an iterative, test-driven, and co-designed policy cycle that identifies opportunities, learns, ideates, prototypes, and tests policies before scaling and implementing them [00:38:44]. This ensures policies work in reality, rather than relying solely on academic modeling or hopes [00:39:16].
*   **Balancing Prescriptive and Principles-Based Rules**: It debunks the myth that all policy must be principles-based [00:39:26]. Where clear, well-articulated, and consistent implementation is desired, prescriptive or clear implementation rules are helpful [00:39:48]. This is crucial as AI is already here, and without clear rules, AI will interpret based on its internal logic, potentially prioritizing financial over human values if not codified [00:40:25].
*   [[role_of_rules_as_code_in_enhancing_transparency_and_accountability | Transparency and Accountability]]: Rules as Code can significantly increase transparency and make rules more understandable for humans [01:09:17]. It helps address the problem of machines making unfair decisions today due to a lack of traceability between implemented processes and the original law [01:00:26]. By capturing the law and data points at the time of a decision, it improves traceability and allows for better auditing and appeal processes [01:01:52]. This ensures governments and public sectors are accountable [01:03:37]. It's about providing citizens with visibility and transparency, and ease of appealability and auditing [01:03:26].
*   [[machinereadable_legislation_and_its_implications | Machinereadable legislation and its implications]]: The code makes rules understandable to machines, but also makes them more understandable for some humans [01:09:37]. Citizens can try out how law reacts or is enacted in different cases using test cases [01:10:17].
*   [[impact_of_rules_as_code_on_public_administration_and_policy_making | Impact of rules as code on public administration and policy making]]: It aims to free up civil servants from easily automatized tasks, allowing them to focus on more complicated work that requires their intelligence [00:46:02]. It addresses public service delivery problems where people struggle to know their social benefits and eligibility [00:44:06]. This concept represents a shift in government organization, moving rulemaking towards something more [[implementing_innovative_ideas | impact-driving]] and [[usercentric_design_and_implementation | user-centric]] [00:54:47].

## Challenges and Considerations

Rules as Code is an emerging area that is still developing [00:24:08]. Key challenges include:

*   **Legitimacy of Interdisciplinary Teams**: A major challenge, common in digital transformation, is the need to build interdisciplinary teams [01:00:03]. This requires bringing together drafters and coders, and convincing government and external stakeholders to work together beyond silos to deliver better digital public services [01:16:19].
*   **Avoiding Technocratic Fantasies**: The goal is not to automatize or disintermediate everything [00:45:42]. There will always be cases requiring discretion from civil servants [00:45:24]. The objective is to improve the quality of public service delivery, not to replace humans with robots for complex decisions like criminal justice [01:09:13]. The focus is on algorithms, not unaccountable machine learning systems that might perpetuate past mistakes [01:09:03].
*   **Political Will and Information Asymmetry**: In France, there was an asymmetry of information during budget bill debates, where government held most structural means of knowing a law's impact [00:47:30]. Rules as Code could help objectify proposed bills and allow scrutiny of hypotheses and algorithms [00:48:17].
*   **Organizational Shift**: It's not just a technical shift, but a mind and organizational shift for government [01:12:38]. It requires changing the chain of command and the way public organizations are managed [01:13:11].
*   **Open Source and Collaboration**: Many existing rules implemented in code are not scrutable or auditable [01:12:21]. A significant effort is needed to focus on opening these systems, promoting open-source development, and creating governance that allows citizens and other agencies to participate and collaborate [01:12:47]. No single public agency possesses all the intelligence needed to write all rules [01:13:41].

## Implementation and Learning

To start implementing Rules as Code:

*   **Focus on Potential Impact**: Begin with areas of legislation or rules that have a clear need for Rules as Code, such as those undergoing massive changes or targeted for service delivery improvement [00:57:40].
*   **Start Small, Prototype, Iterate**: Find a "carrot" or a "shiny toy" to incentivize collaboration among actors [00:58:31]. [[implementing_innovative_ideas | Implementing innovative ideas]] in government should follow the same effective recipes used elsewhere: start small, prototype, and iterate [00:58:51].
*   **Learning by Doing**: The French experience with Open Fisca, a piece of software for simulating the impact of law changes, started as a concrete experience [00:08:31]. Its open-sourcing allowed it to be reused by the public sector to help citizens understand their rights and obligations [00:11:52]. This "driven by use cases" approach fostered contributions from the French administration, NGOs, private companies, researchers, and civil society [01:13:08].
*   **Iterative Policy Design**: The shift should be towards a more iterative and test-driven policy cycle, where policies are only scaled and implemented after they are known to work [00:39:07]. This means co-drafting policy intent, concept models, and logic flows, along with human and machine-readable rules simultaneously [00:37:14].
*   **Closing the Policy-Service Chasm**: The current policy-service continuum is largely broken, with a "chasm" where policy intent is lost or not met quickly enough [01:05:32]. Rules as Code is a small part of a broader necessary shift to close this gap and ensure governments are resilient, effective, and responsive to rapid and exponential changes [01:06:52].

## Future Outlook

The field of Rules as Code is continuously evolving [00:24:21]. The primer aims to provide a robust, clear, and actionable basis for this work to continue and to serve as a point of reference for future efforts [00:24:30]. It hopes to move the conversation forward and help Rules as Code reach its potential [00:26:16]. This is about transforming how policy is done so that governments can be fit for purpose in the 21st century [01:17:18].

## Principles

The primer outlines several principles to guide Rules as Code initiatives:
*   [[role_of_rules_as_code_in_enhancing_transparency_and_accountability | Transparency]] [00:24:52]
*   Traceability [00:24:53]
*   [[role_of_rules_as_code_in_enhancing_transparency_and_accountability | Accountability]] [00:24:53]
*   Appropriateness [00:24:56]

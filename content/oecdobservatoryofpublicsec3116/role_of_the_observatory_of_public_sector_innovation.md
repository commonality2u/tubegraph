The [[OECD observatory and innovation model | Observatory of Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) at the OECD has developed a new model of [[public sector innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Development of a New Innovation Model

This new model identifies four distinct types of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]]:
*   Mission-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Adaptive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

These categories were established based on two key variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>:
1.  **Purpose/Direction:** Whether there is a clear purpose or direction to innovate, or if the core variable is a discovery process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  **Uncertainty:** The level of uncertainty or certainty associated with the processes connected to [[public sector innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The OPSI asserts that varying types of [[public sector innovation | innovation]] necessitate distinct activities and support systems within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Public Sector Innovation

The Observatory argues that governments require four different types of strategies to effectively boost and promote [[public sector innovation | innovation]] within their countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The ultimate objective is for governments to manage "innovation portfolios" that encompass and balance all these different types of [[public sector innovation | innovation]], aligning them with the future goals of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

For instance, anticipatory [[public sector innovation | innovation]] demands greater autonomy compared to enhancement-oriented [[public sector innovation | innovation]], as anticipation and future technological developments often challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Conversely, mission-oriented [[public sector innovation | innovation]] requires clear goals and targets to facilitate cross-silo collaboration to achieve government objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Adaptive [[public sector innovation | innovation]] calls for a "license to generate" new ideas and topics that could be useful or transform the system entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Future Engagements and Goals

The OPSI plans to engage with the challenge of managing these [[public sector innovation | innovation]] portfolios in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. They are actively seeking feedback on these various types of [[public sector innovation | innovation]] and on the portfolio management aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The goal is to help governments identify what actions they can take to create, manage, and steward these strategies to deliver the best solutions for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has provided a new impetus for innovation in public policy and practice globally, heightening its sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This period, marked by an unprecedented global experiment, offers significant lessons for the evolving nature of public sector innovation and future government expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. The pandemic has revealed both the strengths and weaknesses of existing systems, pushing boundaries and challenging conventional approaches to governance.

## Innovation and Public Sector Adaptability

The [[challenges_and_opportunities_of_public_sector_innovation_in_a_crisis | COVID-19 pandemic and associated crisis]] have prompted a fundamental question: has public sector innovation become something to be expected rather than questioned? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> While nearly 40% of survey respondents felt it was too early to tell, the crisis has arguably made innovation unavoidable, thus increasing its tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

The crisis has expanded the range of acceptable policy options, introducing measures that would have been deemed "heretical" previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Examples include widespread social distancing, free childcare, mobile apps with privacy implications, universal basic income, and labor market subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Public willingness to accept such drastic actions, even in the face of inconvenience, suggests a fluidity in the social contract and a willingness to build "new muscles" in the relationship between citizens and the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

## The Role of Trust and Citizen Engagement

A key learning from the Center for Public Impact is the pervasive struggle with "radical listening" â€“ the deep and inclusive engagement with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The outdated notion that governments unilaterally "know what to do" and people will follow has been exposed as a fallacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Existing mechanisms for participative democracy are often immature, leading to power being quickly assumed by a few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Systems often lack empathy and compassion, and are not optimized for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The pandemic has highlighted how assumptions about people's lives were wrong and even damaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. In the US, for instance, people are asked to trust systems that have historically treated them unequally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. However, effective listening can foster trust, relationships, and new ideas, even in dire circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The call for "nothing about us without us" emphasizes that people are experts in their own lives and know what they need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Governments should enable spaces for listening, learning, and collaboration to become part of their DNA, not just an "innovation" side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This involves sharing power, not abandoning it, to foster joint responsibility for actions in complex times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Rethinking Policymaking and Governance Systems

The [[impact_of_pandemic_on_government_practice | pandemic has exposed deep issues within national government policymaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>:
*   **Scattergun approach**: Attempts to influence complex systems by pulling isolated levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   **Path dependence**: Slow to get mandates, systems unable to learn or be agile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

However, the crisis has also demonstrated that policies can be made and enacted more quickly than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. This accelerates a shift towards a different policy mindset: [[systems_thinking_in_government_during_crises | "sinking like a system, acting like an entrepreneur"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

There is a growing tension between two imperatives for public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>:
1.  **Technocratic imperative**: Driven by advances in digital services, analytical skills, targeting, and preemptive systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
2.  **Relational imperative**: Emphasizes the inadequacy of transactional models and the importance of collaboration between state, citizens, and communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

The challenge is to combine these two approaches to create a new model of public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Countries that had made prior investments in basic and fundamental infrastructure (e.g., health protocols, digital safety nets) had more options to improvise and innovate during the emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This includes the repurposing of physical infrastructure, such as India converting railway cars into ambulances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

Developing nations, particularly in Africa and Asia, have sometimes coped remarkably well due to pre-existing protocols from diseases like Ebola or SARS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. This challenges the complacency of "advanced public service and policymaking systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The pandemic has also revealed the importance of functional redundancy in systems, avoiding operation at 100% capacity to cope with crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

## Challenges to Established Norms and Orthodoxies

The pandemic has called into question long-held orthodoxies, particularly around public finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>. The sudden availability of "hundreds of billions of dollars" highlights artificial constraints on spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. This revelation can be liberating, as people may now question why essential services or social safety nets are not funded, understanding that these are strategic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

The crisis has also challenged traditional bureaucratic processes, like the need for multiple letters for inter-ministerial meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. The return to such inefficient practices post-pandemic would indicate a failure to learn fundamental lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.

Matthew Taylor argues that "new public management," a "massive Global failed experiment," was already "dead" before the pandemic, creating a vacuum for new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. The crisis has accelerated the questioning of this approach.

## Leadership and Talent in Crisis

The crisis has led to a deeper self-questioning among leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. Leaders face dilemmas such as:
*   Higher expectations amid resource constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.
*   Expectation of innovation in a context of risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.
*   "Hierarchy is dead, long live hierarchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>: Organizations have worked in flatter, more open ways, with systems falling away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. Yet, fundamental hierarchies might return post-crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>.

The pandemic has promoted **improvisation** as a critical skill, allowing people from lower ranks to take on important tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. There is also a higher tone of **reflectivity** in government, as the crisis has reconnected civil servants to their purpose and brought a sense of humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. However, there is also a sense of "utter exhaustion" across many government levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.

To [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_public_employment | liberate talent]], leaders are encouraged to "stop doing things and start being something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>. This means focusing on values, behaviors, and relationships, and creating safe learning environments for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

## Lessons for the Future and the Role of International Organizations

The year 2020 has been marked by not only the pandemic but also other significant events like the Black Lives Matter movement, which has deepened focus on anti-racism and equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. The widespread experience of poverty during the pandemic, affecting even traditionally prosperous groups, is an undeniable truth that should force different thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.

> "People are not hard to reach, they are seldom heard. They can be your biggest cheerleaders. Work with them. They are your recovery and your rebuild." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>

International organizations like the OECD should reflect on these lessons. It is suggested that the OECD should invest less in "content" (reports, publications) and more in "relationships" â€“ enabling people to spend time together, strengthen networks, and foster learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>. The OECD should also use its platform to advocate for "next-generation governance," challenging "zombie orthodoxies" in public management and finance, and advocating for fundamental investments in areas like universal healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.

The crisis has illuminated "plastic hours" â€“ crucial moments in history when action can lead to significant societal shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>. These moments depend on the right alignment of public opinion, political power, and events, often a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. They rely on social mobilization and leadership, but can easily go unnoticed or be wasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. The overarching lesson is that "nothing happens unless you move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>.

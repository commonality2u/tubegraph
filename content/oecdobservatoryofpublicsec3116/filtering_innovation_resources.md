Public servants frequently encounter diverse challenges, problems, or situations, no two of which are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. [[innovation_tools_and_methods | Innovation tools and methods]] can provide new approaches to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Despite the abundance of [[innovation_tools_and_methods | innovation tools]], toolkits, guides, and playbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, a common difficulty is knowing where or how to begin utilizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. There is a recognized need for a better filter or "compass" to guide users to the appropriate resources for their [[innovation strategies | innovation journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## OPSI Toolkit Navigator

The OPSI Toolkit Navigator was developed to address the challenge of filtering and navigating the vast array of [[innovation_tools_and_methods | innovation resources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Its primary function is to connect a specific situation, problem, or challenge to the most suitable toolkit, effectively [[evaluating_and_filtering_innovative_ideas | filtering out unnecessary information]] to reveal a clearer path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Development Process

The OPSI Toolkit Navigator was created in collaboration with hundreds of public servants and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> through a multi-step process:
1.  **Analysis and Organization** Hundreds of existing toolkits were analyzed and organized based on the actions they inform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  **Situation Exploration** The types of situations, problems, and challenges commonly faced by public servants were explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  **User Conceptualization** Research was conducted into how public servants typically articulate their desired actions or conceptualize a given situation or problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
4.  **Navigational Design** Navigational path options were designed to bridge the gap between specific situations/problems and desired actions, allowing the navigator to suggest tools based on intended outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Beyond Tool Discovery

While finding the right tool is important, the OPSI Toolkit Navigator recognizes that [[adaptive_innovation | innovation]] encompasses more than just tool selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Therefore, it also connects users to:
*   Skills and capacity-building resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Real-life case studies of [[adaptive_innovation | innovation]] in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Fellow public servants and experts who have experience with similar challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has significantly impacted the [[role_of_digital_transformation_in_public_administration | role of digital transformation in public administration]] and the use of [[emerging_technologies_in_civic_engagement | emerging technologies in civic engagement]], particularly in citizen engagement. While traditional methods of public participation were limited, [[digital_tools_for_communication_in_public_services | digital tools for communication in public services]] and virtual platforms became crucial for governments to engage with citizens and for civil society to continue its work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

## Increased Reliance During Crisis
The pandemic necessitated a rapid shift to virtual engagement methods, as face-to-face interactions became difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. This shift accelerated changes in how governments interact with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.

Examples of digital engagement during the crisis include:
*   **Weekly Polls:** The Scottish government runs weekly polls to understand citizens' comprehension of government messages and their compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Live Press Briefings:** Scotland's First Minister leads daily press briefings, explaining the rationale behind decisions, with senior officials like the chief economic advisor also explaining impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Medics in Scotland also regularly talk to the public through different forums, openly sharing evidence and explaining changes as new information becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.
*   **Remote Service Consultation:** Costa Rica has utilized remote service consultation through phone lines and online application forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.
*   **Social Media:** Citizens are encouraged to tweet during events using specific hashtags like #GovAftershock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The [[role_of_digitalization_and_social_media_in_public_services | role of digitalization and social media in public services]] is evident in the fact that citizens use digital and social media spaces to express their opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Virtual Platforms:** Platforms like Zoom, with features like breakout rooms and other tools, have been used for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

## Benefits of Digital Platforms
[[Role of digital advancements in public sector innovation | Digital advancements in the public sector]] offer several benefits for engagement:
*   **Speed:** Digital tools allow for quick feedback and rapid adaptation to evolving circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. They can be easily modified, adapted, and tailored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.
*   **Direct Access:** They provide a closer, more direct route to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>.
*   **Information Dissemination:** Governments can quickly disseminate information to a large audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Data Collection:** Online polls and forms enable systematic collection of citizen feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Accessibility (potentially):** With widespread access to mobile phones, governments can easily be assessed by citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>.

## Challenges and Limitations
Despite the benefits, [[digital_participation_and_inclusiveness | digital participation and inclusiveness]] faces significant challenges:
*   **Digital Divide:** Access to digital platforms depends on factors like internet access, digital literacy, and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.
    *   Those in rural areas, the elderly, or the less socially advantaged may struggle to engage digitally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
    *   Many citizens, especially vulnerable populations, lack access to necessary platforms and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.
    *   Investment in infrastructure should prioritize household internet access over just school internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>.
*   **Inclusivity and Voice Equality:** It's harder to ensure equality of voice and prevent the platforms from being dominated by "the usual suspects" or vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>.
*   **Misinformation and Disinformation:** A major challenge is competing with "fake news" and misinformation, as citizens may find it difficult to identify reliable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
    *   Misperceptions and conspiracy theories are driving non-compliance with public health measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
    *   While misinformation is a real issue, civil society groups act as a safeguard against it when properly engaged and trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, and have actively combatted misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.
*   **Censorship and Restriction:** There have been instances of censorship and restrictions on access to information, undermining accountability and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Privacy Concerns:** New apps and surveillance measures introduced during the pandemic have raised concerns about violations of privacy rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. [[role_and_management_of_data_in_digital_public_services | Responsible digitalization]] must respect people's data and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>.

## Strategies for Effective and Inclusive Virtual Engagement
To make virtual engagement more effective and inclusive:
*   **Moderation:** Digital platforms should have moderators to ensure fair participation and prevent domination by special interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.
*   **Outreach:** Proactive efforts are needed to reach ordinary citizens, for example, through call-outs on prime-time TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Based Engagement:** Governments should provide citizens with evidence before asking for their input, and then explain how their feedback influenced decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Community-Based Organizations:** Recognizing the limitations of purely virtual engagement, it's important to leverage community-based organizations that are close to the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>. These organizations can create "champions" or utilize existing activists to connect with communities not reachable virtually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.
*   **Offline Solutions:** Explore innovative solutions for offline discussions, especially in areas with limited internet access or electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** A hybrid approach combining virtual and offline methods is crucial for comprehensive inclusion, considering diverse categories of citizens (women, youth, elders, rural populations, those without computers/smartphones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.
*   **Citizen Assemblies:** Involving citizens in deliberative processes like citizen assemblies, where they engage deeply with evidence and experts, can be very powerful in correcting misinformation and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.

The **impact of digital spaces on democracy** is significant; they offer new avenues for engagement but also present challenges related to misinformation and inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. The shift to digital engagement during the pandemic has highlighted that governments can act quickly and adapt processes, and this momentum should be maintained rather than reverting to traditional, siloed methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.

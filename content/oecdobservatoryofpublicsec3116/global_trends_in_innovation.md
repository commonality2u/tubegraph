The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), in collaboration with the Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation, actively tracks [[public_sector_innovation_trends | global trends in public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:55">[02:52:55]</a>. This ongoing work, which includes a large annual crowdsourcing exercise and in-depth research, aims to surface new ideas, prepare for future challenges, build networks of innovators, and accelerate the adoption of successful [[innovation strategies | innovation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:01">[08:00:01]</a>.

## Tracking [[Public sector innovation and global trends | Global Trends in Public Sector Innovation]]

OPSI's mission involves:
*   Providing trusted advice to governments on achieving public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:09">[03:06:09]</a>. This includes direct country reviews (e.g., Canada, Brazil) and specific workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:01">[03:19:01]</a>.
*   Uncovering what's next by tracking [[global_trends_in_public_sector_innovation | global trends]] and understanding future possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   Turning new ideas into normal practice by providing tools and frameworks to embed innovation into daily governmental life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

The methodology for tracking [[public_sector_innovation_trends | public sector innovation trends]] involves a large annual call for innovations, which has grown each year, combined with in-depth research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. For one recent report, 552 innovations from 84 different countries were surfaced and analyzed over several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

The goals of this work include:
*   Surfacing new ideas and approaches to prepare for what's next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:01">[08:00:01]</a>.
*   Facilitating the building of a network of innovators, connecting those behind successful cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
*   Working to embed and duplicate success while reducing the impact of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   Speeding up the process of innovation by allowing people to learn from each other and avoid reinventing the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

## Key [[International trends in governmental experimentation and innovation | Innovation Trends]]

Three main [[international_trends_in_governmental_experimentation_and_innovation | trends]] were identified in a recent OPSI report:

### 1. Invisible to Visible

This trend represents a bundle of sub-trends showing maturity in existing approaches and the emergence of new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

*   **Behavioral Insights (Nudges)**: Governments are increasingly using behavioral insights to understand human motivations and nudge citizens towards desirable actions, such as paying taxes on time or contributing to retirement accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Over 200 government-related behavioral insights units have emerged in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   **Gamification**: Beyond traditional "post-it based workshops," governments are developing "serious games" and other gamification methods to innovate on previous work and combat "workshop fatigue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. An example is the European Commission's scenario exploration system, which helps users develop future journeys and scenarios through role-playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. Dozens of these games are available on OPSI's Toolkit Navigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.
    *   **[[Examples of innovation types in action | Case Study: Carrot Rewards (Canada)]]**: This national wellness rewards platform combines gamification and behavioral insights to encourage healthy behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. Users earn points for activities like meeting walking goals or completing quizzes, which can be redeemed through Canada's popular loyalty programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>. This initiative has partnered with health campaigns, such as the flu campaign, significantly increasing flu shot uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.
*   **Immersive Technologies**: The reduced cost of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) is enabling governments, particularly at the local level, to engage citizens in new and immersive ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. These technologies help bring voices to the table that were not typically involved in political processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:20]</a>.
    *   **[[Examples of innovation types in action | Case Study: Finding Places (Hamburg, Germany)]]**: An MIT lab worked with Hamburg's government using AR and Lego blocks on demonstration boards to allow citizens to physically build potential refugee location sites in their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.
*   **Citizen Science**: Governments are leveraging the collective power of citizens to make observations and tackle scientific challenges, demonstrating a growing maturity in this model with systemic use and thousands of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
    *   **[[Examples of innovation types in action | Case Study: Zika Mozzie Seeker (Queensland, Australia)]]**: Thousands of citizen scientists deploy traps to catch mosquitoes, which are then tested in DNA labs to detect the Zika virus and alert authorities for reactive responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.
*   **Positive Deviance**: Governments are studying "positive outliers" in society to understand what factors lead to their success, with the aim of generalizing these findings to the broader population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. An example is the United Nations Development Program's work in Pakistan, studying young women who achieved career success in difficult circumstances to replicate their strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.

### 2. Opening Doors

This trend addresses the increasing complexity that makes it difficult for citizens to participate in government and access its benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>. Governments are working to open doors for at-risk and underserved populations, as well as those engaged in social good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>.

*   **New Currency**: This refers to common goods or non-monetary exchanges that can be used for social rewards or welfare, often linked to sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. As climate and environmental factors become more prominent, governments are reacting by combining sustainability efforts with new forms of currency, supporting a circular economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.
    *   **[[Examples of innovation types in action | Case Study: Recyclables as Transportation Fare (Surabaya, Indonesia)]]**: Launched in 2018, citizens can pay for bus fare with recyclable plastic bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>. This initiative aims to reduce waste (Indonesia is a major plastic waste producer with low recycling rates) and make transportation more accessible for those with limited economic means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>. For about two hours of travel, citizens can exchange 3 x 1.5-liter bottles or 5 x 600-milliliter bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a>.
*   **Platform Economy in Government**: Drawing from the rise of private sector platform apps (e.g., Airbnb, Uber), governments are exploring how they can act as platforms to utilize underutilized public resources for social good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>.
    *   **[[Examples of innovation types in action | Case Study: Underutilized Government Buildings (Amsterdam)]]**: Amsterdam piloted a program to open underutilized government buildings (e.g., meeting rooms) in the evenings and weekends for use by NGOs, overcoming challenges like security and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.
*   **Access to Justice**: With the advent of new technologies and open data, access to justice is rapidly increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. This is a core tenet of democracy and is being facilitated by making information more open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.
    *   **[[Examples of innovation types in action | Case Study: Clear My Records (California, USA)]]**: This civil society project uses open criminal records to help individuals with charges no longer illegal under California law have them expunged. This is crucial for improving employment status and economic mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>.

### 3. Machine-Readable World

This trend highlights the evolution from opening government data to reformatting all inputs and methods of information dissemination into machine-readable and consumable forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>. This transition fuels the development of new services and sets the foundation for emerging technologies like blockchain and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>.

*   **Machine-Readable Laws and Policies**: Governments are converting laws and policies into machine-readable formats to ensure the intent of laws matches their implementation and to enable automatic triggers for changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>.
    *   **[[Examples of innovation types in action | Case Study: Better Rules (New Zealand)]]**: New Zealand is working with software developers to translate rules into clear and precise code with consistent definitions, allowing for instantaneous application by computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:03:00">[36:03:00]</a>. This has been applied to the Rates Rebate Act and the Holidays Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>. This approach shortens feedback loops between legislative intent and implementation, and provides a clear, authoritative source for legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:00">[38:04:00]</a>.
*   **Geographical Data Conversion**: Governments are converting geographical surroundings into machine-readable code for new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>.
    *   **[[Examples of innovation types in action | Case Study: Machine Learning for Land Mapping (Queensland, Australia)]]**: This project uses satellite imagery and machine learning to convert a manual surveying process into machine-readable land features, which can be used for disaster management or land development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:56:00">[30:56:00]</a>.
*   **Emerging Technology Pilots**: Governments are conducting initial pilots of emerging technologies for mission-driven projects to solve major problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a>.
    *   **[[Examples of innovation types in action | Case Study: Blockchain and AI for Counterfeit Medicines (Mongolia)]]**: This test aims to use blockchain to create an immutable record of medicine transactions and AI to detect anomalous readings or counterfeit products, addressing the issue of 40% of medicines in Mongolia being fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>.
*   **Ethical Considerations**: A significant aspect of this trend is the need for governments to focus on the ethical implications of emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:52:00">[32:52:00]</a>. While some uses can be innovative, they can also be controversial (e.g., China's Social Credit system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:16:00">[33:16:00]</a>. OPSI's reports discuss models for considering ethics throughout the lifecycle of initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:00">[34:01:00]</a>.
*   **Government's Role**: The role of government in shaping and regulating emerging technologies is still evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:00">[34:44:00]</a>. Discussions suggest a shift from providing services to providing safeguards and assurances for decentralized systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:00">[35:09:00]</a>. Governments need to engage with nascent technologies to better understand their potential impact and make educated decisions, rather than reacting only when problems arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:03:00">[49:03:03]</a>.

## The Edge of Government Experience

The Edge of Government Experience is an event that culminates OPSI's work, held every February as part of the World Government Summit in the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:41:00">[39:41:00]</a>. It transforms selected case studies into immersive experiences, allowing participants to engage directly with the innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:54:00">[40:54:00]</a>.

The theme for a recent event was "Powered by You," emphasizing that every initiative and decision contributes to innovation within a person, entity, and country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:49:00">[41:49:00]</a>.

Themes and [[examples_of_innovation_types_in_action | case studies]] featured in the Edge of Government Experience include:
*   **Empower the Refugee**: Showcasing projects from Switzerland and Germany on integrating refugees into society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:39:00">[42:39:00]</a>.
*   **Major Digital Twin**: Featuring Finland's "Aurora" project, which aims to design a "digital twin" to help individuals make life decisions based on their data, acting as a digital mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:06:00">[43:06:00]</a>.
*   **Activate Your Mind**: Focused on projects like Canada's Carrot Rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:46:00">[43:46:00]</a>.
*   **Hack Your City Routines**: Featured approximately 40 cities demonstrating how individuals can "hack" their city. Examples include the Netherlands' app for elderly people to extend traffic light crossing times, Pakistan's use of biofuel from cow manure, and Indonesia's recyclables as transportation fare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:00">[44:06:00]</a>.
*   **The Massive City**: Showcasing Singapore's use of AI to predict if a bus driver is likely to have an accident based on their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:25:00">[45:25:00]</a>.
*   **Hyper-Charged Your Harvest**: Featuring a Chinese project using electricity to grow more organic plants and reduce pesticide use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>.

The Carrot Rewards project from Canada was awarded the Edge of Government Award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:13:00">[46:13:00]</a>.

## Factors for Success in [[Government innovation strategies | Public Sector Innovation]]

OPSI focuses on identifying factors that lead to success in public sector innovation, as a lack of these factors often contributes to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:36:00">[50:36:00]</a>. Key factors include:

*   **Correct Problem Framing**: Ensuring that problems are continuously questioned, assumptions are challenged, and hypotheses are tested, rather than accepting a static, predetermined problem and solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:36:00">[54:36:00]</a>.
*   **Iterative Testing and Risk Mitigation**: For innovative projects, where actual results are unknown, risk should be mitigated through iteration and tackling projects in chunks. This allows for assessment, learning, and adaptive next steps, rather than rigid, long-term Gantt charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:45:00">[55:45:00]</a>.
*   **Appropriate Methodologies and Tools**: Using the right [[innovation strategies | approaches and methodologies]] for the specific problem at hand is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:17:00">[56:17:00]</a>. OPSI's [[four_facets_of_innovation | Facets Model]] helps classify innovation types (e.g., top-down, bottom-up, high uncertainty, low uncertainty) and link them to suitable methods and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:29:00">[56:29:00]</a>.
*   **Curiosity and Exploration**: Avoiding "reinventing the wheel" by learning from experiences (including failures) in other countries is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:04:00">[51:04:00]</a>.
*   **Diverse Points of View**: Ensuring that decisions and processes incorporate diverse perspectives, including those from outside the core project team, to avoid misassumptions and better meet the needs of diverse populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:52:00">[51:52:00]</a>.
*   **Multidisciplinary Approaches**: Supporting collaborations between various disciplines (e.g., policy analysts, lawyers, designers, coders) to collectively analyze problems from multiple angles and find the best solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:43:00">[52:43:00]</a>.
*   **Embedding Ethics**: Integrating ethical considerations at every step of an initiative's process to ensure positive outcomes and prevent unintended negative consequences or scandals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:29:00">[53:29:00]</a>. OPSI provides ethical frameworks for consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:57:00">[53:57:00]</a>.

OPSI aims to foster a network of innovators through its website, where users can read case studies, connect with submitters, and utilize toolkits for adapting existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:12:00">[58:12:00]</a>.

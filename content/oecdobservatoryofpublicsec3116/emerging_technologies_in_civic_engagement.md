The co-creation boot camp brought together 100 individuals from the public sector, private sector, academia, and civil society organizations to [[Democratic innovations and citizen participation | co-create solutions]] for civic participation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These challenges were presented by public sector teams from Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands, who committed to collaborating with society to address them by leveraging [[Managing emerging technologies and societal impacts | emerging technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The primary aim was to place people at the center of the solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. [[The role of digital and virtual platforms in public engagement | Technologies]] such as AI, blockchain, and VR were adopted as tools to enhance [[Democratic innovations and citizen participation | democratic participation]], thereby making governance more [[digital_participation_and_inclusiveness | inclusive]] and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Design Sprint Process

Participants followed a structured design sprint process, developed by the OECD, to move from initial challenges to [[Prototyping ideas in civic tech | prototype solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### 1. Aligning on the Challenge
The initial step involved teams aligning on the specific challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This required a deep understanding of the problem, its context, and any prior attempts to resolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Teams also identified key stakeholders, potential barriers, and desired outcomes to ensure a shared understanding and clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### 2. Ideation
Following challenge alignment, teams engaged in brainstorming to generate solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Ideas were quickly brainstormed, discarded, and discussed, with a focus on prioritizing those that best addressed the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The most popular ideas were then developed into well-articulated solution sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### 3. Review and Refinement
Teams dedicated time to review and refine their ideas, narrowing down possibilities to select one for [[Prototyping ideas in civic tech | prototyping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### 4. Prototyping
Day two of the boot camp was entirely focused on [[Prototyping ideas in civic tech | developing the chosen idea into a prototype]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Teams began by creating a minimal prototype canvas based on their sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They explored various approaches, with some utilizing [[digital_tools_for_communication_in_public_services | digital tools]] and [[Role of digital advancements in public sector innovation | emerging technologies]], while others opted for traditional materials like Legos and modeling clay to create tangible representations quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### 5. Final Pitches
Teams then prepared for final pitches, showcasing their solutions built over two days in a five-minute presentation to other participants and a jury of experts from Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, and the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Outcomes
Three solutions were selected for further development, recognized for pushing the boundaries of [[Democratic innovations and citizen participation | civic participation]] through [[Managing emerging technologies and societal impacts | emerging technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. These ideas are expected to shape the future of [[Democratic innovations and citizen participation | civic participation]] across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

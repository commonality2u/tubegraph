This article explores how public sector innovation is being used to tackle complex policy challenges, drawing insights from a webinar launching the latest OPS report on the topic. It highlights the evolution of public sector innovation, the strategic approaches being adopted, and real-world examples from various countries.

## The Evolution and Importance of Public Sector Innovation

The European Commission has been supporting public sector innovation since 2013, following an expert group report that requested EU investment in supporting governments' internal innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This led to a partnership with the OECD in 2015, focusing on public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Over seven years, significant [[Public sector challenges and transformations | achievements]] include:
*   Setting up the OPS platform, which showcases case studies and offers a toolkit navigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   Adopting the Declaration for Public Sector Innovation in 2019, now with 43 signatories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   Establishing a Mission Action Lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Opening up the often cautious government context to share experiences on public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Creating a network of national contact points with government practitioners, addressing sensitive issues like the relationship between political leaders and the civil service, and framework conditions for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

A key result has been the shift from an initial list of "nice-to-have" actions to influencing the core business of government, including policymaking, through initiatives like innovation weeks, trainings, and prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This represents a continuous [[Public sector challenges and transformations | learning journey]] for all involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

[[Innovation challenges and strategies | Innovation is core to government's ability to increase agility and responsiveness]], enhance public value, improve service quality for citizens, and achieve better spending, especially during times of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Public sector innovation ultimately improves lives and helps restore trust in government and democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. It has also been professionalizing, with countries institutionalizing practices and concrete measures to support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Key Challenges Facing Governments

Governments face numerous critical [[Innovation challenges and strategies | challenges]] where innovation is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>:
*   **"Permacrisis"**: Multiple parallel crises, including health, energy, climate, and geopolitical dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Crisis of the Welfare State Model**: Exacerbated by tight public finances, inflation, and potential recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Rising Public Demand**: For engagement, accountability, democratic governance, and deliberations, which are difficult for many public administrations to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Need for Radical Change**: In working methods (flexibility, digitization, hybrid work) and organizational framework conditions to support innovation and capacity building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Long-term Strategic Approach**: Essential to bridge several political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Focusing solely on adaptation to new circumstances leads to reactive modes and delayed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Similarly, incremental improvements in existing systems fail to address underlying problems of institutional setups and mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. A "step change" is required, not just digitizing existing red tape, but cutting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Strategic Approaches to Innovation

### Moving Beyond Reactive and Incremental Approaches
To address current challenges, governments must move beyond merely adapting or making incremental improvements. This requires developing more agility to adapt, more [[Strategic foresight and its challenges in implementation | foresight]] to anticipate, and more ability to guide missions and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### Mission-Oriented Innovation
One approach is to design missions that engage all innovation ecosystem actors in game-changing common endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The European Commission, for example, designed five missions under Horizon Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Mission-oriented innovation is crucial for tackling new complex challenges and setting long-term transformational goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This requires ambitious, targeted, and time-bound commitments from public sector leadership and politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

### Future-Oriented Stance (Anticipatory Innovation)
Governments need to take a future-oriented stance to anticipate what is coming, build strength to meet future challenges, and develop collective vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This involves using [[Strategic foresight and its challenges in implementation | strategic foresight]] as an input for decisions about opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a> and establishing "transformation units" to explore, experiment, and create new evidence for decision-making in new opportunities and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

### The Portfolio Approach to Innovation
The report strongly advocates for a portfolio approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This means thinking about innovation as a portfolio of initiatives that work together towards common goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This approach:
*   Allows for managing risks across public sector activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   Generates synergies between different activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   Enables balancing different types of innovation (e.g., enhancement, adaptive, mission-oriented, anticipatory) to avoid "lock-in" and blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   Helps develop a distribution of responsibilities and coordinates knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   Allows tailoring projects for different types of risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.
*   Avoids fragmentation, tackles risk aversion, and builds synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

### Capabilities for Innovation
Beyond policies, it is crucial to invest in building public sector dynamic capabilities, such as through HR and training, to not only respond to crises but also proactively shape issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>. Organizations need new capabilities to manage innovation in different forms, strategic decision-making processes, and integrate knowledge into policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.

### Ecosystem Orchestration
Modern missions require galvanizing entire ecosystems to work in the same direction, rather than relying solely on top-down directives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. This demands particular skills in engagement and stakeholder management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

## Examples of Implementation: Country Cases

### Korea
South Korea emphasizes the critical role of political support for successful government innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. The report's multi-faceted innovation approach provides an envisioning statement for Korea's government innovation strategy, linking it to high-level public sector reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. This approach aids in:
*   Integrating diverse views and interests, building consensus, and increasing support for the public sector innovation agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.
*   Inducing timely involvement and intervention from civil society stakeholders as strategic partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
*   Setting a national vision linked to broader public sector strategy and innovation objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.
*   Promoting inter-ministerial coordination and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.

Korea has a strong focus on data-driven public administration and evidence-based policymaking, using data for policy evaluation and demonstrating the value and impact of innovative actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>. They rely on an "open innovation" approach, with intensive cooperation among government, private sector think tanks, research institutes, and academic societies to measure government behaviors and spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. Mission-oriented and anticipatory innovation are particularly important for Korea's current government reform, using data, technologies, and social media to improve accountability, social inclusiveness, and digital governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

### Austria
Austria uses the OECD's facets model as an abstract guide, discussing various aspects of projects (e.g., mission, forward-looking) and using it in training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. They also use it for mapping projects and instruments:
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation**:
    *   **Common Assessment Framework (CAF)**: A quality management tool widely used in Europe for step-by-step organizational development at federal, province, and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.
    *   **Finance online**: An online portal existing for 20 years, allowing taxpayers to carry out important actions online, with continuous incremental improvements like integrating a bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation**: Projects like "Future of work" (a real-life lab experimenting with mobile work forms in central administration) and "Digital public administration and ethics" (defining ethical standards for digital technologies and reflection frameworks) anticipate future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented innovation**: "Greening commutes and duty travels" aims to avoid unnecessary travels, shift to environmentally friendly transport, and improve individual transport options, aligning with a clear mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.

While the model helps map projects, it is not yet used as a strategic framework, though this might be a future direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.

### Sweden (Lund)
Future by Lund, an innovation platform in Sweden, focuses on working with external actors across the municipality, companies, university, and research institutes to foster innovation for sustainable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. They recognize that societal challenges require the action of multiple actors, shifting from an inside-out to an outside-in approach, fostering collective sense-making and solutions from innovation networks and ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

They use a "zone model" to categorize innovation processes:
*   **Yellow Zone**: Unclear mandate, ideation, experimentation, based on relations and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
*   **Green Zone**: Developing particular ideas, forming partnerships with shared mandates for results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
*   **Red Zone**: Clear mandate for a single organization to make decisions on funding and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

The OECD Innovation Facets model is overlaid with their zone model to discuss activities and projects within different zones and how to move them forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. This portfolio approach provides a holistic view for all stakeholders, enables identification of gaps and opportunities, tracks accumulated projects, and visualizes the strength of the entire ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>.

## Challenges in Implementing Innovation

Implementing innovation, especially beyond pilot phases, and measuring its success present [[Challenges and strategies in implementing innovation | challenges]]:
*   **Embedding in Regulatory Frameworks**: While some projects can naturally lead to legal measures, incorporating innovative projects into established regulatory frameworks can be complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.
*   **Measuring Success and Outcomes**: Instead of "measurement," some prefer "tracking" innovation portfolios, focusing on documenting activities, changes in actors involved, investment levels, and how specific events impact engagement and mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>. Korea, however, has made significant progress in legalizing data-driven public administration for evidence-based policy making and measuring impact, using both quantitative and qualitative methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>.
*   **Internal Capacity Building**: Large administrations often lack an overarching innovation strategy or centrally coordinated approach, leaving individual services to their own devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>. There's often no dedicated budget for internal capacity building and working on internal change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>.
*   **Co-creation vs. Consultation**: Governments typically have a "consultation culture" where stakeholders are consulted on predefined policy proposals. However, ambitious endeavors like missions require a new working method of co-creation with innovation ecosystem players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.

A poll conducted during the webinar showed that only about 25% of participants felt they had an accurate overview of their organization's innovation portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

## Future Outlook for Portfolio Approaches

Experts foresee several trends for the future of innovation portfolios in the public sector:

### Missions Needing Mission-Oriented Organizations
While there is much experimentation with missions as policy, there is less thought given to whether mission-oriented policies require mission-oriented organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Specific capabilities and attention to organizational setup are needed to deliver on complex missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.

### Strategic Options as Learning Systems
A particular type of portfolio, called "portfolios of strategic options," functions as learning systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. They leverage portfolios as sense-finding and learning mechanisms, designing interventions based on understanding the current state of a system and where it needs to be, attracting necessary relationships, stakeholders, resources, and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. This enables new ways of taking agency, integrating emergent learning from the field into policy making, and building dynamic capabilities for anticipatory responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### "Big Bang Moments" and Sense-Making
To initiate an [[Challenges and solutions in foresight implementation | innovation portfolio approach]], organizations should start with "sense-making" their current portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>. This involves understanding current activities, their relation to the organization's intent or mission, and identifying gaps in resources or capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:43">[01:27:43]</a>. This structured sense-making can then derive a design brief for the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a>.

### Diversity in Sense-Making
It is crucial to embrace diversity in approaches to sense-making, as most organizations tend to have a monolithic understanding of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:54">[01:28:54]</a>. Organizations should allocate time for staff to learn new sense-making approaches to foster a more varied perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>.

## Global Innovation Portfolio Insights

The UAE, with its inherent portfolio approach to innovation, sets ambitious visions and applies pressure to deliver, naturally creating more innovative and diverse responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:18">[01:31:18]</a>. They have strategic programs (M1 and M2 projects) with clear deliverables within 6-12 months, where ministers commit via performance contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>. The Ministry of Possibilities works on mission-oriented innovation to solve wicked policy challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>. They are also part of the Agile Nations Network, unafraid to try untested ideas, such as launching the world's first regulatory authority for digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:49">[01:32:49]</a>.

The Mohammed Bin Rashid Centre for Government Innovation collaborates with OPS on the "Edge of Government" initiative, collecting thousands of innovative cases from governments worldwide to showcase best practices at the World Government Summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>. This global trend analysis enriches the UAE's portfolio with new ideas, moving beyond incremental change and safe bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>.

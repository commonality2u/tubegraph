Innovation proposals are inherently nerve-wracking, as they involve trying something new and rallying people to an idea they may not be comfortable with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The ultimate goal of an innovation proposal is to turn an idea into something actionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, ensuring the idea fits with the reality of the operating context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Tips for Successful Public Sector Innovation Proposals

Successful proposals, whether an email to a manager or an official budget proposal, share commonalities:

### 1. Understand the Strategic Context
It is crucial to understand the strategic context in which your idea exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Even the best idea won't gain traction if the context isn't right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Appreciate other ongoing agendas, political or executive leadership messages, and frame or reframe your idea to match or appear to match the current context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This concept holds true for all proposals, though the depth of consideration varies with the scale of the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### 2. Rally People to Your Cause
Innovation is new, so there are often no ready mental models or examples for people to reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. It's essential to tailor your communication to your audience and their decision-makers' preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This includes considering who would be the most effective voice for your proposal â€“ it might not always be you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. For larger, agency-wide initiatives, much more support and coalition-building is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

### 3. Don't Assume the Merits are Apparent
Novel ideas can easily be misinterpreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. You may understand why an idea is important due to personal experience or research, but others might need more to grasp it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. To make your proposal real and meaningful:
*   Use prototyping to make it visible and tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   Find peer voices to sell the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   Present concrete use cases and point to instances where similar initiatives have worked in other contexts (e.g., other agencies, jurisdictions, or even the private sector) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   Think through different scenarios and consider the [[future_engagement_and_uncertainty_management | future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### 4. Know Your Numbers
Have a strong sense of what you're asking, why, and the expected results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. While many prefer certainty before approval, the world, particularly the public sector, doesn't always work that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Be ready for questions, as the burden of proof for innovation is often higher than for the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Consider:
*   The cost and risks of the current approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   Starting small with a test case, though not all ideas allow for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Promising with confidence, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   Pointing to examples from other agencies or countries where similar initiatives have been applied and yielded value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### 5. Be Ready for the Unexpected
Consider "what if X happens?" scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. What if your proposal is accepted and scaled up, or if new information undercuts your hypothesis? Be prepared for these possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:10:07]</a>.

### 6. Maximize Your Chances / Multiple Payoffs
While "fast failure" is a buzzword in innovation, the public sector often expects results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Think about how your idea can generate learning or build relationships with stakeholders even if it doesn't work as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Ensure your effort can have multiple payoffs to increase its value regardless of its primary outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### 7. Be Open to Change
Don't try to anticipate everything; leave space for input from those receiving the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Managers often want to add their perspective and experience rather than just signing off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

## Common Issues with Innovation Proposals

### Decision-Makers' Understanding
Decision-makers may not fully understand what they've agreed to, especially with novel ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. Watch for warning signs that their expectations differ from yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

### Building Flexibility
Since innovation involves unexpected issues, build in flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Avoid critical dependencies that leave you vulnerable to surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Avoid being too specific in your proposal if it means being held to details that might change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

### Building an Escape Clause
Think about how you can exit a project if it doesn't go as hoped or takes an undesirable direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. The public sector often has a tendency to continue investing in projects even if they aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. Additionally, if a project becomes successful, ensure it's not solely reliant on you for its sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

### Finding the Right Balance of Information
Avoid patronizing decision-makers, but don't assume they know everything about a new concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Test your proposal with people who are both deeply familiar and only loosely familiar with the issue to find the right balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

### Beware of Scope Creep
Scope creep can manifest as adding too many features, making the project unrecognizable, or cutting out core innovative elements, leaving it uninteresting or meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. Be aware of this risk and identify critical dependencies that could make or break the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

## Managing Expectations Upwards

When presenting innovation, especially with "innovation" being a buzzword, it's challenging to manage expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. There's no easy answer, but key strategies include:
*   **Build a Common Language:** Help your organization develop a shared understanding of innovation as something uncertain and uncomfortable, rather than just "innovation theater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. An innovation project is defined by two things: you don't know what will happen, and it will make people uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **Bring in External Voices:** Invite stakeholders, partner organizations, or other public sector agencies with innovation experience to help shape realistic and nuanced expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.
*   **Seek Political Cover:** While risky due to leadership changes, political or senior leadership commitment can make barriers fall away and questions about worthiness less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

## Communicating Failure

The [[role_of_communication_and_transparency_in_building_trust | communication]] of failure in government is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. However, it's crucial to reframe failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

Instead of "failure," consider it "learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. Starting small, testing, and limiting exposure when things don't work is a different framing than outright failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. When dealing with high uncertainty, learning should be a primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.

The line between success and failure can be "wafer-thin," often influenced by unrelated external events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. Innovation involves chance due to its highly uncertain nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. It's important to nuance the concepts of success and failure, recognizing many shades of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. Your best chance of avoiding the word "failure" is ensuring every effort can have multiple payoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

## Dealing with Rejection

If your proposal is rejected, even if you strongly believe in it, consider the following:
*   **Timing:** Sometimes it's the right idea at the wrong time; waiting might be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Reframe:** Try to reframe your idea to better suit the current context, listening to political signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Audience Readiness:** If you're too far ahead of your audience, build a coalition of supportive people who understand the idea's importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **External Voices:** Find stakeholders or voices outside the organization who can advocate for the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   **Lateral Thinking:** Sometimes, it's about thinking laterally and finding workarounds or other sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, although this carries the risk of subverting existing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.
*   **Acceptance:** In some cases, you must recognize that the idea won't happen and either wait for a different context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Getting Started with Innovation

To begin the [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_innovation | innovation process]]:
*   **Low-Fidelity Testing/Prototyping:** Frame problems and test them with low or no-cost methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This can involve simple wireframes or play-acting service interactions to gather feedback and flesh out the reality of the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. An example is using duct tape and paper to prototype a thermostat display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.
*   **Know Your Context:** Understand that the context for innovation varies significantly between different governments (e.g., U.S., Australia, Brazil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
*   **Start Small, Limit Risk:** Begin with experiments within your own job context where you have discretion and don't need permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. This builds confidence, which is important for pitching ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. Testing things for free or with minimal risk allows you to validate hypotheses before a full proposal, making the proposal stronger and reducing organizational risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

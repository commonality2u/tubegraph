The Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] at the OECD has developed a new model for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This model identifies four distinct [[types_of_innovation_within_public_sector_organizations | types of innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Categories of Innovation

The four [[types_of_innovation_within_public_sector_organizations | types of innovation]] are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:
*   Mission-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Adaptive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   Enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

These categories were established based on two variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>:
1.  Whether there is a clear purpose or direction to innovate, or if a discovery process is the core variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  The level of uncertainty or certainty associated with the processes connected to [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Strategic Needs for Different Innovation Types

Different [[types_of_innovation_within_public_sector_organizations | types of innovation]] require distinct activities and support systems within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Governments need four different types of strategies to effectively boost and promote [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] within their countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Governments should aim to have [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] portfolios that include all different [[types_of_innovation_within_public_sector_organizations | types of innovation]], balanced to align with the government's future goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Specific Requirements by Type

*   **Anticipatory-oriented innovation** demands greater autonomy than enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, as anticipation and future technological developments often challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented innovation** requires clear goals and targets to enable people to collaborate across silos and achieve defined governmental objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation** necessitates a "license to operate" for individuals to explore and discover new ideas and topics that could be useful for the government or transform the existing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

The Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] plans to further engage with how to manage these [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] portfolios in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

The Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] at the OECD has developed a new model of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This model identifies four distinct types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Four Types of Innovation
The new model categorizes [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] into four types:
*   **Mission-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   **Adaptive innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Anticipatory innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

## Variables for Categorization
These categories were established based on two key variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>:
1.  **Clarity of Purpose**: Whether there is a clear purpose or direction to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, or if a discovery process is the core variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
2.  **Process Certainty**: The level of uncertainty or certainty within the processes connected to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Implications for Government Strategies
Different types of innovation necessitate different activities and support systems within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Governments require distinct strategies to effectively boost and promote [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] within their countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Innovation Portfolios
The goal is for governments to develop "innovation portfolios" that encompass all these different types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. These portfolios should be balanced in a way that aligns with the future goals of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Specific Needs for Each Type
*   **Anticipatory-oriented innovation** requires significantly more autonomy than enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This is because anticipation and future technological developments often challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented innovation** demands clear goals and targets to enable people to work across silos and achieve government objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation** requires individuals to have a "license to explore" and discover new ideas and topics that could be beneficial or transform systems in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Future Engagement
The Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] plans to engage further with how to manage these innovation portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. They are seeking feedback on these different types of innovation and on the portfolio management aspect, specifically on what governments can do to create, manage, and steward these strategies to develop optimal solutions for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

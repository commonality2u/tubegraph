Anticipatory innovation involves engaging with the future to understand and influence emerging technologies and their societal impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This field of innovation is highly uncertain as the future is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, it is crucial for governments to engage with concepts that are not yet a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## The Need for Early Engagement
Once innovations become dominant designs, it becomes very difficult to alter them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. For instance, the historical decision regarding which side of the road cars drive on was an innovation that, once established, locked in many mobility systems and influenced infrastructure development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This illustrates how past training practices led to decisions that shaped long-term realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Today, new technological and non-technological choices are becoming innovations and dominant designs in their own right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Therefore, governments need to be proactive and think ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. While it's impossible to know exactly what will happen, it's essential to analyze and consider various possible futures to influence emerging dominant designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Ethical Boundaries and Emerging Technologies
A major contemporary concern revolves around [[managing_emerging_technologies_and_societal_impacts | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Governments must consider what kind of technological or [[ethical_considerations_and_trust_in_data_usage | ethical solutions]] are required for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This requires anticipatory innovation to foresee different potential solutions and actively shape them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Key questions include:
*   What [[ethics_in_behavioral_insights | ethical boundaries]] should be established for [[managing_emerging_technologies_and_societal_impacts | artificial intelligence]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   What types of blockchain solutions should be adopted, if any? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

These questions are possible to influence now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, but likely will not be in 10 to 15 years when [[managing_emerging_technologies_and_societal_impacts | artificial intelligence]] is pervasive or a large portion of the population is using blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. To ensure beneficial outcomes for their citizens and countries, governments need to anticipate these developments and have a say in their direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

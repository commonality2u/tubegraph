The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred dramatic transformations within the public sector, prompting exploration into how these changes can be sustained beyond the immediate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A poll conducted among participants indicated that 66.7% believe the pandemic is inducing sustainable, resourced, and long-standing innovations in [[digital_transformation_in_governance | governance]] that will endure, while 33.3% anticipate a return to "business as usual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

This discussion is part of the OECD's "Government Aftershock" initiative, an experiment in collective learning aimed at understanding the pandemic's implications for government institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The initiative focuses on three central questions: what should be left behind, what should be kept, and what should be done differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Innovations Unlocked by Crisis

The OECD's Innovative Responses Tracker has captured over 430 innovative responses to the pandemic across various policy areas and functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Many of these innovations, such as the shift to widespread [[remote_work_in_public_sector | remote working]] (work from home arrangements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> and [[digitalization_and_government_services | telehealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, were already "in the works" in some countries for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The crisis also spurred seemingly "miraculous" shifts towards practices long advocated by practitioners and scholars of government, including:
*   Desiloing the state and encouraging more cross-policy collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Greater engagement of stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   Raising the risk tolerance of public sector institutions to enable innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   Reducing administrative burden and creating space for entrepreneurial public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

The key question is why it took a crisis to push these changes forward and if the public sector is reliant on crises for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Why the Delay? Historical Barriers to [[digital_transformation_in_government | Digital Transformation]]

Several factors explain why these beneficial changes often required a crisis to be implemented:
*   **Bandwidth and Attention Span** Public service organizations often lack the bandwidth to focus on consistent programs of change and reform, being bombarded with daily issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. It's difficult to sustain interest and funding for contingency planning over long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.
*   **Vested Interests** Reform often challenges existing practices, affecting economic interests or making life more difficult for certain groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. These groups can resist necessary changes that would otherwise benefit the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion** The public sector often exhibits high risk aversion, partly due to the public scrutiny and accountability mechanisms (e.g., parliamentary committees, inquiries) that can result from mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. This contrasts with the private sector, where learning from errors might be more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This "gotcha culture" hinders entrepreneurial spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
*   **Lack of Entrepreneurial Mindset** Some bureaucrats, driven by habit rather than law, resist changes. The crisis revealed that many rules were based on habit, not legal necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy and Slow Processes** Traditional, slow-moving, and territorial communication structures were replaced by faster decision-making, small dynamic teams, and increased ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.
*   **Citizen Demand** The crisis clearly demonstrated to citizens the importance and necessity of [[digital_transformation_and_egovernment | digital services]] like [[digitalization_and_government_services | telehealth]], creating a new demand side for digital technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

The crisis acted as a "burning platform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, pushing past cultural aversion to risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. It provided clear directions and autonomy to public servants on the front line, fostering a team sport mentality to fight the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. Many governments reorganized into more agile task forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

## Changes Here to Stay

While the long-term impacts are yet to be fully seen, some changes are confidently expected to endure:
*   **[[Remote work in public sector | Remote Working]] and Flexible Workplaces**: The shift to "work from anywhere" will likely persist, leading to a blended approach rather than a full return to traditional office work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. This also prompts reconsideration of how classified information is handled remotely and how performance is evaluated without in-person observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.
*   **[[Digitalization and government services | Digitalization]] and Data-Driven Decision-Making**: The removal of paper forms and increased reliance on data for decision-making are expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. This includes the application of artificial intelligence, such as chatbots, to reduce service time and allow human employees to transition to higher-value work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
*   **Increased Agility and Innovation**: Governments will maintain a faster reaction speed, agility, and a culture of incremental innovation and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. This includes developing new ideas and practices, even if they only scale during future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.
*   **Collaboration and Consultation**: Enhanced collaboration within government, between government and society, and among nations is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. There's a move towards deformalizing processes and designing bottom-up solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.
*   **Health System Adaptation**: Increased capacity in health systems, along with developed test and tracing infrastructures, will likely remain as foundational elements for future crisis response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>. Large-scale immunization programs will require more sophisticated data systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.
*   **Focus on Social and Racial Justice**: In the United States, there's a growing systematic appreciation of the impact of social and racial justice on government programs, leading to efforts to adjust structures for more equitable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Foresight and Risk Management**: The crisis highlights the need for greater investment in foresight and scenario planning, moving beyond just risk registers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.

## Warning Signs and Capacity Constraints

Despite the positive changes, several challenges remain that could hinder sustained transformation:
*   **Societal Capacity**: Governments cannot move faster than society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Issues like digital literacy and digital accessibility (e.g., access to computers and broadband for online education) need to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.
*   **Distribution of Aid and Services**: In complex federal systems, ensuring equitable and efficient distribution of aid funds to all levels of government and individuals can be challenging due to varied "flow pipes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. Public education systems, critical for social support and food security in some communities, have been upended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.
*   **Public Trust**: The politicization of crisis responses and varying levels of support for government programs can impact public trust, which in turn affects the government's ability to respond to future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. Trust in government is crucial for driving change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.
*   **Human Capital and Data Management**: While the crisis may attract more skilled individuals to public service due to a renewed sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>, a major challenge remains in how governments use, link, and extract value from data to make better decisions and provide improved services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning**: There is a need for continuous learning at all levels within government, not just for new hires, but for senior administrators as well, to adapt to ongoing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.

## Funding and Sustaining Changes

A critical question is how to make the budget case for necessary investments once the urgency of the crisis recedes, especially considering the austerity measures often adopted after previous shocks like the global financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.

Current national debts (e.g., nearly 100% of GDP in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>) and decreasing budget flexibility suggest that governments may have little choice but to face austerity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>. Local governments are spending rainy day funds as tax bases decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>. While [[digitalization_and_government_services | digitalization]] and other structural reforms can be self-financing in the long term, leading to a relatively short payback period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>, they alone may not solve the broader fiscal challenges. Demographic problems will further strain economies and increase age-related entitlement and health costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.

The current crisis differs from the 2008 financial crisis in public perception; the pandemic was not caused by government, and the response has generally garnered more public confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>. Focusing on technology, as Serbia did, has shown promising economic results, with the tech sector becoming a significant contributor to GDP growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.

## Administrative Habits to Decommission

To sustain positive changes, certain administrative habits should be abandoned:
*   **Inability to End Things/Deprioritize**: Governments are often good at starting initiatives but poor at ending them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>. This includes having too many priorities, which by definition means no real priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.
*   **Excessive Risk Aversion**: A cultural shift towards taking balanced risks is needed, along with a more rational political and media discourse that focuses on learning from mistakes rather than a "gotcha culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>.
*   **Long Policy Cycles**: Move away from slow, traditional policy-making and adoption cycles towards "smart" and incremental policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.
*   **"Lifetime Career" Model**: Encourage a more permeable service model allowing movement between government and the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. This can bring [[role_of_digital_tools_in_government | private sector innovation]] into government, share government concerns with the private sector, and foster higher risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>.
*   **Large, Outsourced IT Projects**: Shift away from multi-year, largely outsourced IT projects towards shorter-term deliverables on digital initiatives, which lead to greater success and better cost management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.

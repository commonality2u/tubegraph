The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) at the [[OECDs Role in Public Sector Innovation | OECD]] has developed a new model of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Model of Public Sector Innovation

The OPSI model outlines four distinct types of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:
*   Mission-oriented [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Adaptive [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Anticipatory [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Enhancement-oriented [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

These categories were established based on two primary variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>:
1.  Having a clear purpose or direction for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  The degree of uncertainty or certainty associated with the processes connected to [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, with a discovery process as a core variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Implications for Government Strategies

The OPSI argues that different types of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] necessitate varied activities and support systems within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Consequently, governments require four distinct strategies to foster and promote [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] within their countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The ultimate aim is for governments to possess "innovation portfolios" that include all these different types of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], balanced in a way that aligns with their future goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Specific Needs of Innovation Types
*   **Anticipatory-oriented [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]** requires significant autonomy, as anticipation and future technological developments often challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]** demands clear goals and targets to encourage people to collaborate across silos and achieve governmental objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Adaptive [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]** necessitates a "license to explore" to discover new ideas and topics that could be useful or transform existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Future Engagement

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation plans to further engage with how these [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] portfolios can be managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. They seek feedback on both the different types of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and the portfolio management aspect, specifically on how governments can create, manage, and steward these strategies to deliver optimal solutions for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

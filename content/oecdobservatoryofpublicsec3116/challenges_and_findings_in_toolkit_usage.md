In 2017, the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) faced the task of building a toolkit for public sector innovation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. However, there was an initial skepticism that "the world does not need another toolkit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It was believed that the world had reached "peak toolkit," with hundreds already available, often creating more "noise" than "signal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

This perspective was reinforced by Andrea Snook of UK Policy Lab, who stated, "toolkits are like toothbrushes: everybody has one but nobody wants to use someone else's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This suggests that while many toolkits exist, there's a strong inclination for individuals or organizations to create their own, rather than adapting existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## User Research and Initial Challenges
To understand the real needs of users, OPSI conducted a workshop at its 2017 conference with public sector leaders and civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The goal was to learn about their journey when trying something new, how they found information, who they reached out to, and what tools and methods they used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This research revealed the "daily struggles for public sector innovators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, leading to the development of [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | the OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] not as a new toolkit, but as a way to help people find existing toolkits based on their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Key Findings on Existing Toolkit Usage
Based on extensive research into over 500 existing toolkits and user feedback from public sector innovators, several common challenges and findings emerged:
*   **Over-reliance on Past Tools** There is a tendency for innovators to rely on tools that worked in previous situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Misalignment with Problems** Toolkits are often chosen because they appear "bright and shiny" or because a colleague used them, rather than being genuinely aligned with the specific problem at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Skill Mismatch** Toolkits do not always consider the existing skill levels of users; some require very advanced skills to implement their methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Granularity Issues** Toolkits can be either "too granular or too broad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, making it difficult for users to find what they need at the appropriate level of abstraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Learned Helplessness** Particularly in the public sector, polished toolkits can inadvertently create a sense of "learned helplessness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Innovators may be reluctant to adapt or "break" a well-produced toolkit, even if their specific situation and context demand modification for the method to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Characteristics of an Ideal Toolkit
Based on these findings, OPSI identified several characteristics of an ideal toolkit:
*   **Adaptable and Transferable** Toolkits should be designed to be adaptable and transferable, not necessarily directly transferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Approachable and User-Centered** They should be easy to understand and use, with clear instructions on what to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Action-Oriented** Unlike guidance or knowledge bases, toolkits should facilitate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Modular** Toolkits should be modular, allowing users to combine parts from different toolkits to suit their specific context and problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges in the [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]]
The [[development_and_purpose_of_the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | development of the OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] aimed to address these challenges:
*   **Focus on Innovation Tasks** The compendium of toolkits is organized around "innovation tasks" or "jobs to be done," which extend beyond typical problem-solving to include group behavioral jobs, approach planning jobs, and contextualization jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This ensures that innovators can find resources for broader aspects of their work, such as team coordination and setting up collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Granularity and Abstraction Levels** The navigator differentiates between methodologies, tactics, playbooks, guidance, and tools, recognizing that toolkits can contain various levels of granularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This helps users find content at the appropriate level of abstraction for their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Adaptation and Capacity Building** The navigator places special emphasis on freely accessible toolkits that are easier to adapt, modify, and remix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This approach encourages capacity building within teams, as the act of remixing and adapting fosters understanding and skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Toolkits are awarded badges (Open Source Basic, Champion, Hero) to indicate their level of adaptability and reusability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Social Proof and Peer Connection** Recognizing that trying new methods can be daunting, the navigator connects toolkits to hundreds of OPSI case studies of innovation in government, providing "social proof" that others have successfully implemented new practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. It also links to OPSI's user base of over 1700 public sector innovators worldwide, fostering a global network for discussions, reviews, and seeking advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

This approach ensures that [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | the OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] supports innovators in finding the right tools and fostering continuous learning and adaptation within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

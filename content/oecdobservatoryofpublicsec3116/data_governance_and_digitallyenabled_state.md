This article summarizes key discussions from an OECD conference session on [[digital_transformation_and_data_governance | data governance]] for a digitally enabled state, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Key Themes from Global Conversations

Over 60 events in 17 countries, gathering over 4,000 people, highlighted several keywords regarding public sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>:
*   Fostering learning, experimentation, and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   Urgent need for transformation to strengthen government resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Becoming more agile, people-oriented, and collaborative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The central question posed is whether data, and its improved use, can address these challenges and create conditions for more resilient governments capable of designing sustainable recovery strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Effective responses require a whole-ecosystem approach, bringing together different state powers, economic and societal representatives, and academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic

The pandemic has accelerated [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation in government]] at an unprecedented rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Microsoft's CEO noted more digital transformation in two months than in two years, a sentiment amplified for the public sector to possibly "20 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Governments rapidly harnessed data to identify health hotspots, medical supply needs, and first responder deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Accelerating Government Action
Governments demonstrated an ability to act faster than generally perceived, with tasks being completed in weeks rather than months or years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### Contact Tracing and Data Pervasiveness
*   **Singapore's TraceTogether App**: Developed in four weeks, this app, along with a supplementary token, achieved about 60% population coverage for contact tracing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This reduced the contact tracing cycle from 5-6 days to under 2 days (specifically 1.2 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Data privacy is maintained as data resides on the device and is only downloaded if a person tests positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. High data pervasiveness (estimated 70% population coverage) is crucial for effective contact tracing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **French Challenges**: France's centralized contact tracing app faced trust issues, partly due to a centralized infrastructure perceived as more vulnerable to attacks and data leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. Lack of transparent data and contradictory information led to public mistrust and the rise of conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

### Data Sharing and Collaboration
The UK's Government Digital Service (GDS) rapidly established data sharing agreements to support 2.2 million clinically extremely vulnerable people, a process that usually takes months was completed in weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This was done transparently, involving regulators, and adhering to data protection legislation and ethics frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

A shared sense of purpose and imperative, combined with a clear understanding of legislative, security, and ethical landscapes, enables governments to work at pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

### Communication and Trust
Taiwan's strategy, summarized as "fast, fair, and fun" by Digital Minister Audrey Tang, contrasts with France's challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **Fast**: Crowdsourcing ideas from civil society enabled rapid responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. In France, civil society often acted faster in releasing data or developing tools than the administration, which showed blockages in adopting these projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
*   **Fair**: Transparency in data is crucial for public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. Lack of clear, shared information can lead to misinformation and distrust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   **Fun**: Humor can be a powerful tool for public policy, nudging behaviors, and fighting fake news due to its virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. A less engaging communication style, like in France's "StopCovid" app rollout, can hinder uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. Incorporating gamification aspects could entice greater usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

### Importance of Formulating Questions
Governments need to be sophisticated not only in using data but also in formulating the specific questions for which data can provide answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Sourcing these questions internally and externally, and building collaborations around them, can lead to faster insights and address a broader range of societal issues beyond just epidemiology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

## Pillars of [[digital_transformation_and_data_governance | Data Governance]]

Effective [[digital_transformation_and_data_governance | data governance]] involves:
*   **Vision and Strategy**: Formulating a clear strategic vision to leverage data as a key asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:02">[04:02:02]</a>.
*   **Legal and Regulatory Frameworks**: Updating frameworks for accessing and sharing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:30">[04:16:30]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure**: Building sound, scalable public sector data infrastructures (cloud storage, APIs, metadata sharing platforms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:31">[04:27:31]</a>.

### Singapore's Data Infrastructure
Singapore's proactive investment in a "government data architecture" years ago proved critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. This includes:
1.  **Single Sources of Truth**: Cleaning data and designating "agents" to control single sources of truth, overcoming data duplication and uncertainty across departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.
2.  **Trusted Centers**: Establishing well-preserved, maintained, and accessible trusted data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.
3.  **Data Exchange Gateway (APEX)**: Building an API gateway (APEX) four years prior to the pandemic, which now handles nearly 3,000 datasets and 600 million calls a month, allowing rapid data pulling from different agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.
4.  **Skills and Capabilities**: Training 20,000 civil servants over four years to use data and ask the right questions to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.

### UK's National Data Strategy
The UK's vision by 2030 is to have joined-up, trusted public services, policies, and analysis better driven by data, with data as a key enabling factor alongside digital and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. The recently published National Data Strategy focuses on:
*   **Capability**: Developing data experts and data-literate policy makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>.
*   **Standards and Quality**: Improving data quality, standardization, and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>. A new Data Standards Authority was launched to balance collaboration with enforcement of standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.
*   **Interoperability**: Ensuring systems allow appropriate data flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.
*   **Legal Framework and Culture**: Deploying the legal framework appropriately and shifting culture regarding risk appetite and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.

## [[collaboration_and_governance_in_digital_services | Collaboration and Governance in Digital Services]]

### Public-Private Partnerships and Data Collaboratives
The pandemic has accelerated [[collaboration_and_governance_in_digital_services | collaboration and governance in digital services]] between the private and public sectors around data, especially through "data collaboratives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>. While there is increased experimentation, these efforts are often ad hoc and hard to establish due to barriers like lengthy data sharing agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>.

To make data collaboration systematic, sustainable, and responsible, a "human infrastructure" is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>. This involves designated professionals within the private sector, potentially called "chief data stewards," who can respond to data solicitations, understand corporate risks, coordinate internal sign-offs, and consider how data will be used for public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.

### International Cooperation
Strengthening international cooperation is crucial. The need for a global platform for the trusted, systematic, sustainable, and responsible free flow of data is greater than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. While national responses to the pandemic were rapid due to existing infrastructure, more work is needed at the global level to enable data flow, especially for challenges like vaccine distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

## Ethical Use and Trust
Protection of personal data is a critical issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. Issues like the centralization of contact tracing apps, insecure communication channels for civil servants (e.g., judicial system using Gmail), and the rise of new technologies like facial recognition and drones for surveillance raise concerns about privacy, sovereignty, and the need for clear regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

Trust is foundational for the ethical use of technology and leveraging data for social good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>. Public engagement, possibly through citizens' assemblies, can help understand public sentiments regarding data reuse and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

## Outlook and Future Commitments

While the crisis has proven the value of data and accelerated [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]], it is unlikely to be sufficient alone to overcome deep-seated issues like bureaucracy, silos, and limited infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. However, it has shown "the art of the possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>.

Commitments moving forward include:
*   Continuing to build data infrastructure and fostering public-private partnerships, including national API marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>.
*   Building trust in institutions by promoting transparency and actively trusting civil society's ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.
*   Developing legislation to guarantee citizen data protection as new technologies emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>.
*   Placing equity at the center of data efforts to ensure services address injustices and inequalities, making data work for all people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.
*   Remembering the importance of humanity and the human touch, ensuring technology remains a tool to bring people together rather than replacing human elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:33">[01:22:33]</a>.
*   Focusing on responsible innovation, building participation into the design of data-driven public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>.

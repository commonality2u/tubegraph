The Observatory of [[Innovation in Public Sector | public sector innovation]] at the OECD has developed a new model for [[innovation in the public sector | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This model identifies four distinct types of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## OECD's Model of Public Sector Innovation

The categories within the OECD's model were established based on two primary variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>:
*   Whether there is a clear purpose or direction to innovate, or if a discovery process itself is the core variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   The level of certainty or uncertainty associated with the processes connected to [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

It is argued that different types of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] necessitate varying activities and support systems within [[government_innovation_strategies | government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Therefore, [[government_innovation_strategies | governments]] require four different types of [[public_sector_innovation_strategies | strategies]] to foster and promote [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] within their countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Four Types of Innovation

The model includes the following types of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]]:

*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>: This type requires clear goals and targets to enable people to work across silos and achieve the desired governmental objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>: For adaptive innovation, individuals need a "license to explore and discover" new ideas and topics that might be useful in the future or transform the system entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **[[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | Anticipatory Innovation]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>: This type of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] demands significantly more autonomy than enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This is because [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipation]] and future technological developments often challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Innovation Portfolios

The ultimate goal for [[government_innovation_strategies | governments]] is to possess "innovation portfolios" that encompass all these different types of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. These portfolios should be balanced in a way that aligns with the future goals of the [[government_innovation_strategies | government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Future Directions and Feedback

The Observatory of [[Innovation in Public Sector | Public Sector Innovation]] plans to engage further with the management of these innovation portfolios in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. They are seeking feedback on these different types of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] and on the portfolio management aspect, specifically on how [[government_innovation_strategies | governments]] can create, manage, and steward these [[public_sector_innovation_methods_and_strategies | strategies]] to achieve the best solutions for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Governments today grapple with immense uncertainty and complexity, necessitating strategies that are both anticipatory and transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. A key theme emerging from global discussions is the need for governments to anticipate, experiment, and explore systemic solutions to current and future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis has opened a window of opportunity for policy options previously unavailable, making it crucial to sustain this momentum for innovation and transformation beyond the immediate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This involves adopting methods and approaches that foster more [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] and systemic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Key Principles of Systems Thinking and Anticipation

### Acknowledging Complexity
Innovation is an uncertain process, and its outcomes can be largely unpredictable, with scale-up taking time to manifest effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Society operates as a complex adaptive system where culture, markets, regulation, and the physical environment interact and co-evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Understanding this complexity is vital for effective governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.

### Embracing Deep Uncertainty
A fundamental challenge is a mindset that assumes the past dictates the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. Governments often extrapolate from past trends, underestimating the possibility of radical future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic, despite prior scientific warnings, largely took the world by surprise, highlighting this gap in embracing deep uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

### The Role of Foresight and Participatory Technology Assessment
[[Anticipatory governance in technology policy | Anticipatory governance]] in technology involves foresight and participatory technology assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. This does not mean predicting future states of innovation but rather asking questions about plausible futures to inform present actions that shape desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. It's about recognizing the co-evolution of technology and society, rather than technology being a deterministic force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

## Methods and Approaches for Anticipatory Innovation

### Agile and Adaptive Working Methods
The European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT), Europe's largest innovation network, effectively deployed agile and [[adaptive_and_anticipatory_innovation_strategies | adaptive working methods]] during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This included:
*   **Impact-Driven Projects:** Planning for impact-driven projects and distributing grants through small entities like "beehives," maximizing interdisciplinary interaction and bottom-up control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Rapid Crisis Response:** Rapidly assessing their portfolio and creating a crisis response initiative, channeling significant budget (60 million euro) into 207 new innovation projects and ventures from 32 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Intelligence:** Utilizing a distributed operational model with over 2,000 partners to quickly gather intelligence on project impacts and needs for adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

### Goal-Based Regulation and Collaborative Enforcement
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) emphasizes shifting from rule-based to goal-based regulation, especially due to the unpredictable nature of AI and complex cyber-physical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. Key aspects include:
*   **Multi-Stakeholder Guidelines:** Under goal-based regulation, multi-stakeholders create guidelines and standards, enabling even small companies to leverage technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring by businesses, with accountability for data, is crucial for assessing if regulatory goals are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
*   **Continuous Review and Feedback:** Goals may change, requiring continuous checking, reviewing, and feedback loops to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.
*   **Incentivizing Cooperation:** Implementing mechanisms like deferred prosecution agreements incentivize businesses to cooperate with investigations and disclose information, fostering learning within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>.

### Strengthening the Science System
The role of science in society needs to be elevated, fostering true partnerships between scientists, policymakers, and the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. Key recommendations include:
*   **Transdisciplinary Research:** Moving beyond interdisciplinary research to transdisciplinary research that crosses boundaries between science and other social and political spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. This bridges the knowledge-action gap needed to address crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
*   **Public-Private Linkage:** Recognizing the importance of collaboration between private and public sector science, as the private sector holds significant potential solutions and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
*   **Agility and Knowledge Dissemination:** Accelerating the dissemination of scientific knowledge to policy circles and the public to enable quick reactions to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
*   **Stable Institutions and International Cooperation:** Supporting stable and robust institutions dealing with risk (e.g., epidemiology, public health) and fostering international scientific cooperation, especially benefiting developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

## Overcoming Barriers to Anticipation

### Bridging the Long-term and Short-term
The challenge is how to translate long-term future scenarios into immediate decisions that build resilient strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. Mission-oriented approaches can bridge this gap by setting longer-term goals (e.g., decarbonization) and articulating step-by-step actionable courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>. The visibility of a clear goal and a phased approach incentivizes cooperation across agencies and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.

### Finding Robust Solutions
Given the multitude of possible future scenarios and actions, the key is to identify "robust portfolios of options" or "robust solutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. These are sets of actions that work across different scenarios, often by identifying co-benefits or multiple dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.

### Learning from Experience
Governments need to transform their processes to become learning systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. This includes:
*   **Empowering Society:** Empowering society to accept that not all outcomes can be predicted with 100% certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>.
*   **Redefining Success:** Adjusting reward systems for policymakers and politicians to acknowledge that clear attribution for change is often impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Leverage Points:** While it's impossible to "get out of" complexity, it's possible to understand it, find leverage points to influence systems, and divide larger systems into smaller, more understandable archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

Ultimately, [[systems_thinking_in_innovation | systems thinking]] and [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] require a continuous cycle of discussion, implementation, observation, and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.

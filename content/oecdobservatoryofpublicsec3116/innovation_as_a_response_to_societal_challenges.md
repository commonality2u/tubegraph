[[definition_and_challenges_of_innovation | Innovation]] can be driven by a clear purpose to address specific societal challenges or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This approach is known as mission-oriented [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It involves setting clear goals for why [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | innovation]] is needed in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Mission-Oriented Innovation Explained

Mission-oriented [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | innovation]] is fundamentally about purpose-driven [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It focuses on solving a specific [[challenges_faced_by_governments_that_require_innovation | challenge]] or problem within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The objective is to achieve a defined outcome, which then drives all efforts within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Moonshot Example

One of the most well-known examples of mission-oriented [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | innovation]] is the moonshot, which aimed to send humans to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Clear Goal:** The mission had a definitive, binary goal: either reach the moon or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **System Alignment:** Organizations like NASA structured their entire systems to fulfill this specific goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Emergent Innovation:** This ambitious goal led to a significant amount of direct [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Furthermore, many different types of innovations emerged as beneficial side effects of the mission-oriented approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Even though the primary goal is specific, the process can generate many new ideas that might be beneficial in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. However, the ultimate success is measured by achieving the initial, clear objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This highlights how [[adapting_science_and_technology_for_societal_challenges | adapting science and technology for societal challenges]] through mission-oriented approaches can lead to significant breakthroughs and broader benefits.

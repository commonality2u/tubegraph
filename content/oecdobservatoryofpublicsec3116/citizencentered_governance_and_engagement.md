The Government Aftershock high-level forum convened a global dialogue to discuss the crisis and its revelations about the role and expectations of government, both currently and in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The event was titled "Building Back Better Together and Reaffirming the Role of [[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | Citizen-centered governance]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The forum highlighted the widespread need for governments to enhance their [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | citizen engagement]] methods in response to the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## The Need for Enhanced Citizen Engagement

A poll conducted during the forum revealed that 89.3% of participants believe there is a greater need to engage with citizens now than before the onset of COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. While governments have made efforts, only 18.8% of respondents felt their government made great efforts to involve citizens collaboratively, with nearly 60% indicating engagement was limited, and almost 22% reporting no collaborative engagement opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.

## Government Learnings and Adaptations During Crisis

### Costa Rica
The crisis exposed the limitations of existing instruments designed for service delivery that struggle to be truly tailored to every citizen's expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Often, focus was placed on urgent needs rather than strategic gaps, such as in education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Public services under stress revealed that some tasks can be automated, but this creates social and economic consequences by distancing public officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Deputy Minister Molina Rodriguez emphasized the challenge of reaching all citizens, especially those without access to digital means, refugees, foreigners, low-income individuals, informal workers, or those uninterested in public issues due to daily urgencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Governments cannot meet all expectations alone, necessitating a boost in shared responsibility frameworks, such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) and decent work legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Engaging citizens offers two main benefits:
1.  Receiving feedback on government performance and service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.
2.  Maintaining support for the democratic system, as support for democratic values and institutions heavily relies on effective service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

### Scotland
Scotland already had a strong emphasis on [[citizen_participation_in_technology_governance | citizen participation]] in policymaking through its national performance framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The pandemic magnified this need, requiring deeper, quicker, and faster [[citizen_participation_in_technology_governance | citizen engagement]] to ensure understanding and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Measures implemented in Scotland include:
*   Weekly polls to gauge citizen understanding of government messages and compliance levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   Daily press briefings led by the First Minister, with senior officials explaining rationale and impacts of restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   A policing approach of "engage, explain, encourage, and only if needed, enforce," reflecting governance with public consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

Higher compliance and [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | trust in government]] are linked to greater availability of information, fostering cohesiveness and [[citizen_participation_in_technology_governance | citizen participation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The Scottish government prioritizes taking feedback and adapting to public input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Humility within government is crucial, acknowledging that they don't have all the answers and need communities to understand and be part of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

## Established vs. Crisis Engagement Methods

While governments have increased polling and communication, there hasn't been sufficient time for deep, deliberative [[participatory_processes_and_governance | citizen participation]] during the immediate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

### Tackling Misinformation
A significant challenge during crises is combating misperceptions and misinformation that drive non-compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Experimental research shows that involving citizens directly – having them interact with experts, ask questions, and then report back to their peers – is a powerful way to correct misinformation and build understanding of scientific consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## The Role of Civil Society
From the perspective of Civicus, an increase in government [[engagement_with_civil_society | engagement with citizens]] during the pandemic has been observed and documented through success stories in their "Solidarity in the Time of COVID" report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. However, a range of restrictions on freedoms have been introduced, hindering [[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | citizen participation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Concerns include:
*   Increased censorship and restrictions on access to information, undermining accountability and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   Threats and arrests for criticizing state responses, especially related to lockdowns affecting vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   Crackdowns on protests, even when within international human rights law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
*   Restrictions on media and the passage of restrictive "fake news" laws used to control public expression on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
*   Police abuses during lockdowns, surveillance, and violations of privacy rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

Despite these challenges, civil society groups have shown high agility in responding to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>:
*   **Rapid Response:** Community-based organizations were quick to provide humanitarian emergency support, reaching vulnerable populations often overlooked by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.
*   **Safeguard Against Misinformation:** Civil society plays a crucial role in combating misinformation through new campaigning methods, awareness raising, and innovative outreach, including art (e.g., graffiti in Kenya and Afghanistan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.
*   **Accountability and Transparency:** They engage in monitoring the distribution of aid and services, and demand visibility regarding foreign funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.
*   **Innovation in Engagement:** Civil society adapted by moving to [[digital_and_virtual_engagement_for_effective_citizen_participation | digital and virtual spaces]] while also using existing participatory approaches with local governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.

## Strengthening Citizen Engagement for Resilience

To build resilience in [[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | citizen engagement]] practices, it's crucial to have established frameworks before a crisis hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

Key elements for strengthening engagement:
*   **Digital Platforms:** While convenient during pandemics, challenges exist in ensuring equality of voice and preventing domination by "usual suspects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. Moderators and outreach beyond traditional channels can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.
*   **In-depth Survey Work:** Providing citizens with evidence *before* asking for their input, and then transparently explaining how their feedback influenced decisions, builds [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.
*   **Digital Inclusion:** Virtual engagement faces limitations due to infrastructure, access, and usability gaps (e.g., for rural populations, elderly, or those without smartphones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. Effective [[digital_and_virtual_engagement_for_effective_citizen_participation | virtual engagement]] requires recognizing this gap and leveraging community-based organizations and local champions to bring unheard voices into virtual spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a>. Offline discussions and technologies designed for extreme environments (like internet shutdowns) can also bridge the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** It's essential that citizen input leads to tangible action. Ignoring feedback can breed cynicism rather than [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   **Humility in Government:** Promoting humility and a willingness to listen is vital, especially when competitive democracy often favors dominant characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>. This means balancing routines and technical criteria with citizen expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>.
*   **Shared Responsibility:** Giving citizens responsibility in implementation and monitoring (e.g., adherence to public health protocols) demonstrates their importance as contributors to public policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sector Collaboration:** Deeper [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | collaboration between governments and citizens]], including with philanthropy and across public services (e.g., treating knife crime as a public health crisis), is essential for tackling multi-dimensional challenges and building resilient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated changes in how governments engage and interact with citizens, moving away from more formal, often siloed, consultation methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. This shift empowers diverse groups within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>. The pandemic has also changed what citizens value, questioning views held before and highlighting the importance of fairness and essential workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.

[!INFO]+ Key Takeaways for the Future
*   **Radical Push for Civic Space:** There is a need to be more radical about civic space and fundamental freedoms, as restrictions imposed during the pandemic are not acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. The sustainability of crisis responses depends on inclusion and dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.
*   **Foster Significant Partnership:** Moving from a "market approach" where citizens are viewed as clients to one of genuine partnership and [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | collaboration]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. This means co-designing solutions and services, ensuring [[participatory_processes_and_governance | inclusive approaches]] for vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>.
*   **Continued Learning and Adaptability:** Governments must continuously revise routines, use digital tools effectively, and embrace pilot experiences and ongoing adaptation to remain responsive to citizens' needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.
*   **Addressing Underlying Issues:** Crises like the pandemic highlight pre-existing problems in communities and societies, requiring a focus on building resilient systems and societies to respond to future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.
*   **Empowering Citizens as Part of the Solution:** The future of governance involves empowering citizens and businesses as drivers of change, fostering bottom-up approaches to achieve a greener, fairer, more inclusive, and sustainable economy and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.

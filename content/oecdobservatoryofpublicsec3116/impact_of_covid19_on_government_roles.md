## Introduction to the Forum
The "Government Aftershocks" series convened a global dialogue focused on the [[challenges_faced_by_governments_in_the_covid19_crisis | crisis]] and what it revealed about the role and expectations of government, both current and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This specific session centered on the future of public employment, emphasizing the importance of people within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Simon Clayton, HR Director for policy, inclusion, and reward at HMRC in the UK, and chair of the OECD's Public Employment and Management (PEM) working group, moderated the session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

### Forum Objectives
Sessions like this contribute to the development of a "call for action" for governments, to be developed by the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>. Attendees were encouraged to participate using discussion and questions modules, with popular questions prioritized for Q&A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. A poll was launched to gather opinions on the medium-term impacts of the [[challenges_faced_by_governments_in_the_covid19_crisis | coronavirus crisis]] on public employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:42">[02:02:42]</a>.

## Shifting Understanding of Public Service and Employment
Panelists discussed how the [[impact_of_covid19_on_government_operations | crisis]] has altered the perception of public service and employment.

### Lessons Learned
*   **Slovenia:**
    *   Public administration demonstrated agility and responsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   The reputation of the civil service increased significantly due to its role in providing anti-corona law packages and ensuring the functioning of critical infrastructure and economic measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   The stereotype of civil service being rigid and slow to adapt was broken, as nearly 70% of civil servants shifted to remote work practically overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   A poll showed that over half of Slovenian civil servants found their engagement, efficiency, and satisfaction higher while teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   Digital skills, video meetings, and distance training were rapidly adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   The key lesson is to "never go back to the way it was before the [[challenges_faced_by_governments_in_the_covid19_crisis | corona crisis]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Australia:**
    *   Australia faced dual crises in 2020: bushfires and the pandemic, requiring the public service to manage both disaster recovery and pandemic response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   The [[impact_of_covid19_on_government_and_citizen_relations | crisis]] brought into sharp focus the critical role of the public service in meeting community needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
    *   A critical lesson learned is that working together as "one APS" (Australian Public Service) improves effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
    *   Remote work at scale was possible, with productivity increasing for some roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   This opens new markets for recruiting talent, as physical location becomes less critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
    *   Future focus will be on balancing remote work with staff well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Ireland:**
    *   There's a heightened awareness of the importance of public services and administration since the lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
    *   Significant increases in cross-collaboration among agencies, government departments, and voluntary groups were observed to support vulnerable communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   Public sector workers proved to be flexible, adaptive, and innovative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
    *   Success depends on "good people" who are comfortable, competent, and capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
    *   Lessons include balancing specialists and generalists, growing distributed leadership (especially supporting middle management), and anticipating changes in recruitment, retention, and workforce development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    *   Local authorities demonstrated incredible coordination and leadership in setting up community initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Public Services International:**
    *   The public understood that public employees are essential workers, not just bureaucrats defending privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
    *   Public employees proved flexible and skilled, adapting work methods and using knowledge, often without adequate training, to address the emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
    *   Many faced difficulties: pressure from users when working in presence, and deep changes to work without adequate equipment or regulation when teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
    *   Collective bargaining helped in some countries, but regulation of working conditions for telework remains an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

### Moderator's Reflections
The discussions highlighted a strong shift in how societies view the role and importance of the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. A massive theme was the emergence of [[impact_of_covid19_on_international_cooperation | cross-agency]] and cross-team collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. The challenge is to maintain this collaborative way of working into the "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Developing Resilience and Necessary Skills
Panelists explored how to further develop resilience in public workforces and the skills and management practices required.

### Key Focus Areas
*   **Slovenia:**
    *   Resilience requires efficient use of digital technologies in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.
    *   The civil service must become a "learning organization," investing in people, their skills, and their workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
    *   Digital technologies will radically change public administration, moving towards interconnected organizations and virtual teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
    *   New important skills include critical thinking, creativity, judgment, and responsive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
    *   The most important skill for the [[future_of_work_and_technology_in_government_services | future of public employment]] is the "ability to continuously learn and adapt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
    *   Intergenerational cooperation is crucial, as older civil servants found telework less efficient than younger ones; no one should be left behind due to lack of digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Promoting coaching and mentorship can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Australia:**
    *   Existing reforms aimed at building skills for the future, particularly in managers and leaders, have been accelerated by COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
    *   Focus areas include learning agility, emotional intelligence, and good judgment, which are essential for managing change, uncertainty, and solving problems quickly through collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
    *   The service is realizing the importance of "soft skills" like influence and communication, as analytical ability was previously overvalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
    *   There is a need to re-evaluate recruitment and capability building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
    *   Solid foundational skills in digital and data are critical going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.
    *   Australia is building professional streams (e.g., strategic HR, data, digital) to manage change and provide trusted advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
    *   A balance of working from home and in the office needs to be explored as the new norm, given successful management of workforce health and mental health during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
*   **Ireland:**
    *   Ongoing reform programs are shaping the demand for training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.
    *   Focus areas include distributed leadership, strengthening middle management, public sector values, and mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
    *   Growing specialists in areas like HR, project management, cyber security, and data is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
    *   Leaders need to be visible and prioritize mental well-being and wellness support for staff, acknowledging the challenges of juggling work, family care, and the fear of the unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
    *   Learning from "communities of practice" and cross-government working groups sharing expertise is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
    *   The crisis has shown that public servants can quickly adapt and manage risk, challenging the stereotype of being risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.
    *   New roles focused on staff wellness and coaching, similar to those in the private sector, may emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   **Public Services International:**
    *   Developing resilience requires political will to invest in public services and administration, reversing decades of cuts, understaffing, and increasing turnover, which proved detrimental during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
    *   Emergencies should not be used as a tool for political competition among parties or different levels of government, as this negatively impacts effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
    *   Training and providing workers with tools and skills are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.
    *   The pandemic highlighted the need to strengthen and develop digitalization and high-tech skills within public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.
    *   Teleworking should continue in a balanced way, but requires evaluation of different situations, addressing challenges like lack of adequate physical space at home and the disproportionate [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_sector_management | impact on women]] due to increased care burdens and potential for domestic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.
    *   Governments must address these issues, with political will being the first and foremost requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

### Moderator's Summary on Resilience
The discussions on resilience strongly highlighted the challenges of working from home. Ensuring that remote work is fair and proportionate, not just for senior staff or those with suitable domestic circumstances, is crucial for future resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. The varying experiences of work-life balance and associated challenges will require careful decisions as people's expectations have changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

## Opportunities, Risks, and Pitfalls for Public Employment Post-Crisis
Panelists considered opportunities for rethinking public employment and the risks/pitfalls to manage.

### Rethinking Public Employment
*   **Slovenia:**
    *   The greatest risk is the work-life balance for civil servants in remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.
    *   Opportunities lie in not returning to pre-crisis remote work situations; remote work can be highly efficient for civil service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
    *   A job policy should be designed to maximize benefits of both remote and in-office work, defining which tasks are best performed where <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>.
    *   Civil servants need help achieving work-life balance to prevent burnout, especially those managing children during lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.
    *   A cultural shift in management is needed, where leaders build trust, motivate employees, and communicate effectively, especially during prolonged challenging conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.
    *   More emphasis should be placed on crisis management skills for civil service leaders, ensuring they have a "touch for people" rather than just being "obsessed with reports" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.
    *   The importance of proper leadership in civil service has never been higher, requiring the "right people in the right places" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
*   **Australia:**
    *   Many opportunities exist to rethink public employment given widespread remote work and increased mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
    *   A challenge is dealing with a very tired workforce from sustained crises (bushfires, COVID-19); maintaining well-being is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.
    *   There is a strong will among senior executives to embed "one APS" collaboration and efficiency in governance arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>.
    *   **Public Service Hubs:** Exploring the possibility of public service hubs closer to where people live, allowing public servants from different agencies to work together without daily long commutes to city centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>.
    *   **Public Service Mobility/Surge Reserve:** The crisis demonstrated the effectiveness of mobilizing workforce from non-critical roles to busy areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. This positive experience, especially for younger graduates, is leading to the development of a "surge reserve" workforce with known skill sets for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. This will enable faster deployment of the right people to the right places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.
    *   The current moment is an opportunity for reform due to unified leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>.
*   **Ireland:**
    *   Need to continue growing a professional workforce with specialists, while also maintaining leaders with "wise counsel" who can interface between political and administrative structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.
    *   New skills will be demanded in cyber security, governance, managing risk, and supporting/coaching staff wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.
    *   Ireland's civil service is developing a policy for remote working, with unions being consulted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.
    *   More working hubs for public servants will be rolled out across rural Ireland using state-owned properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.
    *   **Unintended Consequences of Remote Work:** Must consider pitfalls such as:
        *   Remote work being perceived as a disadvantage for promotion ("out of sight, out of mind") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
        *   Challenges in making remote workers visible and supporting informal networks and "water cooler" conversations that spark ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
        *   Risk of unconscious bias and a "re-traditionalization of roles" (especially for women) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.
    *   Future leadership training should focus on adaptability, agility, visibility, managing risk, and supporting cross-collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>.
    *   Learning from the business world and involving the whole community, not just public administrators, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.
*   **Public Services International:**
    *   The low poll result for austerity and pay cuts is positive, as these policies were mistakes of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.
    *   Flexibility should be in terms of skills and organizational adaptability to community needs, not employment contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.
    *   Public administration must be ready to respond to short-term needs with a long-term vision, prepared for future crises like climate change, social crises, and natural disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.
    *   This requires selecting staff with the right competencies and leaders who understand their role in connecting different levels of democratic institutions and governments for greater effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
    *   The narrative about public administration must change from being seen as "just a cost" to recognizing its vital importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
    *   Social recognition for public service workers and the role of public administration is needed to stimulate a different public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
    *   Public employees are ready to adapt, but this requires regulated working conditions for both in-person and teleworking environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.
    *   The ability for workers to organize and form unions, and engage in collective bargaining, is a crucial precondition for addressing problems and supporting workers' lives and the mission of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

## Poll Results and Reflections
The poll results showed that about half of respondents expect the pandemic to lead to a more flexible and resilient model of public sector employment, and 40% anticipate a more digitally savvy public sector workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. Importantly, very few believe nothing will change or that new rounds of austerity are likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

### Panelists' Reflections
*   **Slovenia:** The poll results are comforting as they indicate a widespread belief that things will not return to pre-crisis ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. Achieving a more flexible and resilient public sector requires continued work on performance, employee engagement, leadership vision, and promoting public service values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>. Public employees proved to be "heroes" by keeping systems functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.
*   **Ireland:** To have a flexible and resilient public sector, a digitally savvy workforce is essential, as these two aspects balance each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. The focus must be on enabling staff to work digitally while maintaining values, performance management, and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.

## Q&A and Personal Commitments

### Addressing Workforce Gaps
*   **Public Services International:** Many countries, like Italy, have an aging public administration workforce due to years of turnover freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>. This results in less adaptable workers, particularly concerning digital knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>. Public administration needs to support a process of "refreshing" its staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. However, workers showed a readiness to learn and adapt to teleworking and complex procedures when faced with urgency and a common cause, highlighting the importance of training and social recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>.
*   **Ireland:** Public servants have been highly adaptable despite challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>. There's an observed increase in people considering early retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>. While some jobs may become redundant, the focus is on reskilling and enabling the current workforce to adapt, utilizing their existing skills to support communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.

### Sustaining Collaboration
*   **Australia:** The [[pandemic_impact_on_government_practices | crisis]] has accelerated a more joined-up, collaborative public service through increased communication, new systems, and working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>. To embed this, it needs to be normalized through governance arrangements and by fostering a culture where collaboration and engagement are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>. Incentives must align with collaborative goals, and senior executives' performance evaluations should include peer feedback on their collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a>.
*   **Slovenia:** Collaboration was highly successful during the crisis for short-term activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>. The lesson is to extend this collaborative approach to a long-term vision, which requires strategic orientation, supportive culture, and effective leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>. The lack of digital skills in some employees highlights a past failure to be a "learning organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. Collaboration is key to future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>.

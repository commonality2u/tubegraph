A co-creation boot camp brought together 100 individuals from the public sector, private sector, academia, and civil society organizations to co-create solutions to civic participation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These challenges were presented by public sector teams from Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands, who committed to collaborating with society and leveraging [[technological_advancements_in_governance | emerging technologies]] to address them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Enhancing Democratic Participation

The core aim of the challenges tackled was to put people at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Technologies such as AI, blockchain, and VR were utilized as tools to enhance democratic participation, making governance more inclusive and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Design Sprint Process

Participants worked in teams and followed a process designed by the OECD, structured as a design sprint, to transition from challenges to prototype solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Aligning on the Challenge
The initial step involved teams aligning on the specific challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This required understanding not only the problem itself but also its context and any prior attempts to resolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Teams identified key stakeholders and users, potential barriers to implementation, and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This ensured a shared understanding and a clear direction for moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Ideation
Following the alignment phase, teams delved into brainstorming solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. They rapidly generated ideas, discarding and discussing them, while simultaneously prioritizing them to address the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Solution Sketching and Refinement
The most promising ideas were developed into well-articulated solution sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Teams created quick drawings to give shape and form to their solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. After sketching and discussion, teams reviewed and refined their ideas, narrowing down possibilities to select an idea for prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Prototyping
The second day was dedicated to developing the selected idea into a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Teams started by creating a minimal prototype canvas based on their sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They explored various approaches, with some utilizing digital tools and [[technological_advancements_in_governance | emerging technologies]], while others opted for traditional materials like Legos and modeling clay to quickly achieve a tangible representation of their solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Final Pitches and Future Development

Teams prepared for final pitches of their solutions, showcasing their two days of work in five minutes to other participants and a jury of experts from Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, and the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Three solutions were chosen for further development, recognized as prototypes that significantly pushed the boundaries of [[citizen_participation_in_technology_governance | civic participation]] with [[technological_advancements_in_governance | emerging technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. These ideas are expected to shape the future of [[citizen_participation_in_technology_governance | civic participation]] across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

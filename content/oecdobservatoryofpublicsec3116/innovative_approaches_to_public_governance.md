The International Conference on Governments Beyond Recovery and Towards a Future-Fit Public Sector focused on exploring opportunities for public governance as the world emerges from global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">00:00:39</a>. Key themes included [[innovation in the public sector|innovation]], adaptation, strategic foresight, and co-creation, with a particular emphasis on how [[Innovation in Public Sector|innovation]] and inclusion can serve as pillars for governance in recovery efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">01:09:09</a>.

## Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly challenged governments, forcing bold and decisive responses to support businesses, households, and save lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">01:19:21</a>, including a massive 27% of GDP in public support across OECD countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">01:19:54</a>. The crisis highlighted the importance of being prepared and flexible within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:43">02:22:43</a>.

Early in the pandemic, many countries, including Slovenia, were unprepared despite prior warnings from organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:54">02:37:54</a>. This led to struggles with coordination and depleted stocks of protective equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:20">02:42:20</a>. Initial European-level responses were chaotic, resembling "the Middle Ages" with new borders and traffic jams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:17">02:52:17</a>. However, subsequent phases, such as recovery and resilience funds, and financial support for vaccine development, became success stories of coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:54">02:55:54</a>.

The pandemic exposed both advantages and disadvantages in public sector responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:42">02:26:42</a>. Countries with more flexible systems and leaders able to implement measures quickly showed initial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:37">02:47:37</a>. However, long-term [[innovation in public administration|innovation]] for solutions like vaccines came from countries with free markets, freedom, and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:01">04:40:01</a>. A key lesson is the need for better preparation for future challenges, including establishing common approaches for symmetric threats like pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">01:21:11</a>.

## Driving Innovation in Public Governance
[[Innovation in Public Sector|Innovation]] in public governance is crucial for a future-fit public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">01:59:00</a>. This involves:

*   **Strategic Embedding of Innovation and Foresight**: Public sectors must strategically embed [[innovation in the public sector|innovation]] and foresight at the heart of policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">01:59:00</a>. This commitment is central to the OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">01:59:00</a>.
*   **Adaptation and Flexibility**: Petra Majdiƒç, a former cross-country skiing champion, exemplified adaptation and [[innovation in the public sector|innovation]] in her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:47">02:47:47</a>. Coming from a small country with limited resources, she was forced to find innovative ways to achieve similar training conditions as larger nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:24">05:51:24</a>. Her team also dared to be different with a unique racing suit, which attracted sponsors and was never copied, demonstrating that being different is an opportunity, not a handicap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:19">06:30:19</a>. This mindset of adaptation and not taking the status quo for granted is vital for both sports and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:06">09:56:06</a>.
*   **Empowering People and Mindset Change**: A key takeaway from the private sector is that people are the drivers of change, reorganization, and [[innovation in public administration|innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:29">03:42:29</a>. Public administrations need to empower staff to improve things and change their mindset from simply following procedures to actively thinking about how to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">01:12:21</a>. This includes changing recruitment practices to focus on the ability to react to situations rather than just memorizing data, and allowing movement between public and private sectors to foster mutual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">01:13:51</a>.
*   **[[Collaborative approaches in public sector innovation|Collaborative Approaches]]**: [[Innovation in Public Sector|Innovation]] often occurs in ecosystems where knowledge and talent from universities (academic sector) combine with the strengths of the private sector, complemented by public sector funding and a supportive legal framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:19">05:49:19</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation**: The accelerating digital transformation offers opportunities, but also risks and challenges that need to be managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">01:15:15</a>. This includes ensuring equitable access to digital infrastructure, investing in skills, and addressing cybersecurity and data privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:33">01:18:33</a>.

### Addressing Long-Term Challenges: Climate Change
The COVID-19 pandemic, a sharp and immediate crisis, offers lessons for the longer-term crisis of climate change, which is less immediately visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">00:58:49</a>. Both require the ability to think differently, apply change management, and bring different resources together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">01:00:29</a>. However, climate change demands greater long-term planning, strategic foresight, and investment in technologies, particularly clean energy solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">01:01:20</a>.

A major challenge is the need for global-level solutions, as climate change cannot be tackled effectively at local or national levels alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">01:03:50</a>. The European Union is attempting to lead this by setting ambitious goals to become CO2 neutral by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">01:07:03</a>. However, there is still a lack of sufficient investment into real [[innovation in the public sector|innovation]] processes, especially in areas like post-lithium battery technology for electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">01:09:42</a>. Public trust in science is also critical for supporting these necessary investments, which often involve significant spending that is not immediately visible to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">01:05:53</a>.

## Conclusion
A future-fit public sector must be better prepared for future challenges, creating an [[innovation in the public sector|innovation]]-friendly society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">01:21:49</a>. This involves equipping citizens with the skills to prioritize and use information effectively, starting from kindergarten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">01:22:20</a>. Furthermore, there must be greater cooperation and knowledge sharing between countries and organizations, removing bureaucratic obstacles that hinder the exploitation of existing good practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">01:16:00</a>. By embracing [[challenges and strategies for innovative public services|innovation]], adaptation, and collaborative approaches, governments can navigate future crises and build a more resilient society.

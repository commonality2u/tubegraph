The COVID-19 crisis has profoundly impacted public administrations and organizations, forcing them to adapt swiftly to new challenges and societal needs. This period has highlighted the critical importance of resilience, innovation, and continuous improvement in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>.

## Immediate Responses and Challenges

Public sector organizations implemented several immediate measures to address the [[government_response_to_the_covid19_crisis | COVID-19 crisis]] and its effects on economies, societies, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>:

*   **New Institutional Structures** Cross-ministerial coordination instances increased, with 77% of centers of government reporting this development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. More coordination and institutional mechanisms were created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.
*   **Increased Spending** Government expenditures rose as a share of GDP in many countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.
*   **Emergency Regulations** Many emergency regulations were approved, with a sharp increase in exceptions to regulatory impact assessments to fast-track new regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   **Health and Sanitary Measures** New protocols were put in place to protect users and civil servants while maintaining productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.
*   **Digitalization and Teleworking** Many organizations shifted to hybrid delivery modes and digitized services rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. Over 60% of civil servants in most OECD countries worked remotely in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>.
*   **New Communication Protocols** New communication channels were used to address challenges like misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

The crisis revealed that public sector organizations need to address complex, multi-dimensional, and cross-cutting issues. Future priorities include restoring growth, protecting vulnerable populations, building a green economy, ensuring debt sustainability, and creating employment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Future Preparedness

Key lessons from the pandemic emphasize the need for public administrations to be "fit for the future" by strengthening their [[public_sector_resilience_and_transformation | resilience]] to future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>:

*   **Preparedness and Agility** Organizations need to be ready and capable of moving rapidly, for instance, to digital solutions and large-scale remote working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
*   **Skills and Capabilities** Cultivating skills among public sector employees to solve complex problems and [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovate]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
*   **Foresight Capacities** Developing the ability to anticipate future challenges is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.
*   **Coordination and Communication** Strengthening internal and external coordination, consultation, and clear communication is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.
*   **Embedding Cross-Cutting Challenges** Integrating environmental concerns, inclusiveness, digitalization, and integrity into strategies is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.

## Role of the Common Assessment Framework (CAF)

The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) has proven to be a valuable tool in supporting public sector adaptation and building [[public_sector_resilience_and_transformation | resilience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

*   **Foundation for Innovation** CAF provides a platform for organizations to improve and be ready to [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovate]], fostering a different mindset and embracing change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. It supports constant learning and understanding organizational performance holistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Alignment with Resilient Characteristics** The 2021 Global Resilience Report by Deloitte identifies five characteristics of resilient and [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovative organizations]] (prepared, adaptable, collaborative, trustworthy, responsible), all of which are embedded in the CAF model and its principles of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Strengthened by Crisis** CAF has emerged stronger after the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Organizations that utilized CAF or other quality performance tools outperformed others during adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement** CAF promotes a culture of continuous development and systematic improvement, which is a necessary "space" for [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>. It acts as a coach for organizational development and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.
*   **Explicit Focus on Innovation** The CAF 2020 model mentions "innovation" 50 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. It is explicitly included in the principles of excellence (Principle 6: continued learning, [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]], and improvement) and in Criteria 2, focusing on strategy and planning, and specifically in sub-criteria 2.4, "manage change and [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] in an agile way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>.

### Case Studies in Public Sector Adaptation

Several city administrations have demonstrated successful adaptation through CAF implementation:

*   **City of Vienna**
    *   Vienna has used CAF for nearly 20 years, alongside other quality management tools like ISO 9001 and EFQM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>.
    *   CAF has acted as a coach for both organizational development and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.
    *   Vienna believes [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] requires a solid foundation of organizational culture, continuous development, and systematic improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.
    *   The city's experience shows that focusing on small improvements can lead to significant gains, establishing a basis for larger [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:50">[02:08:50]</a>.
    *   Vienna emphasizes that [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] needs preparedness, planning, and consideration of impact and outcome, making citizens partners in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:29">[02:16:29]</a>.
    *   The international CAF network facilitates mutual exchange of experience and development, fostering [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] by learning from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>.

*   **Kraków City Administration**
    *   Kraków has used CAF since 2011, conducting four self-assessments that led to several improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
    *   Their 2017 self-assessment focused on improving communication with clients (citizens), especially vital during the [[covid19_responses_and_government_adaptability | COVID-19 crisis]] when traditional channels were difficult to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
    *   Key projects implemented post-2017 CAF assessment:
        *   **Taxpayer Portal (2018)**: An electronic tool with an information platform and a personalized communication channel for citizens to check tax liabilities, submit declarations, and pay taxes online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This reduced phone inquiries and was a great success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:33">[03:33:33]</a>.
        *   **Simplifying Official Language (2019)**: Guidelines and workshops trained officials to use more inclusive and understandable language in both writing and speaking, leading to improved citizen satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:53">[03:49:53]</a>.
        *   **Parcel Lockers for City Services (2020)**: Inspired by the [[covid19_responses_and_government_adaptability | COVID-19 crisis]], this allowed citizens to receive physical documents (e.g., license plates) at convenient hours without direct contact, significantly reducing queues and improving accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:44">[03:28:44]</a>. This innovation is expected to remain even after the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:57">[03:50:57]</a>.
        *   **Integrated Contact Center (2021/2022)**: A new unit to centralize answers to questions about different city services and municipal units, addressing issues with telephone contact and making information more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:01">[04:03:01]</a>.
    *   CAF acted as a trigger, inspiring new ideas and focusing management and employees' attention on improving communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:51">[04:33:51]</a>.
    *   The initial trigger for CAF adoption in Kraków was financial assistance from the European Union for implementing new management tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

*   **Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and Sports**
    *   Their first CAF self-assessment identified a need for an employee survey to understand satisfaction, climate, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:58">[04:59:58]</a>.
    *   They initiated a collaborative project with seven other public organizations to create a uniform methodology for employee surveys, enabling comparisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:56">[04:51:56]</a>. This voluntary partnership among professionals was driven by a desire for improvement and enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:50">[04:53:50]</a>.
    *   The "Employee Eyes" questionnaire, developed in two months, integrates modules on organizational climate, employee satisfaction, perception of change, and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:47">[05:04:47]</a>.
    *   The survey aimed to gain insight into organizational workings, provide information for strategic decisions, allow for comparisons, and identify benefits and areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:18">[05:20:18]</a>.
    *   The most crucial phase is the implementation of survey results into actionable plans and changes in the work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:17">[05:17:17]</a>.
    *   The project highlighted the added value of cooperation and networking among CAF users at a national level for the model's further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:14">[05:54:14]</a>.

### Ongoing Research and Future Directions

The OECD, with support from the European Commission and participating countries (Belgium, Slovenia, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Finland, and Spain), is analyzing how organizations using CAF coped during the pandemic. This project aims to:

*   Take stock of [[public_sector_resilience_and_transformation | public sector resilience]] in the wake of COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>.
*   Highlight and promote [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | innovations]] that emerged to ensure greater [[public_sector_resilience_and_transformation | resilience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>.
*   Support the CAF network and strengthen the model's use and development in the post-[[covid19_responses_and_government_adaptability | COVID-19]] period, focusing on areas that enhance organizational [[public_sector_resilience_and_transformation | resilience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

The project will survey CAF users to identify challenges and draw lessons to inform future improvements to the CAF model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. A synthesis report is expected by the end of next year summarizing these [[government_responses_to_COVID19_and_lessons_learned | lessons learned]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>.

Public polls indicate that the use of CAF has had a significant [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_transformation_in_the_public_sector | impact on human resource management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. This aligns with studies showing a major impact of CAF on human resource management and people criteria. The [[covid19_responses_and_government_adaptability | COVID-19 crisis]] has highlighted weaknesses in this area, emphasizing the need for step-by-step improvements, particularly concerning new working methods like remote and hybrid models and their effect on knowledge management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.

The session "Accounting for Innovation with CAF" highlights the significant connection between quality, innovation, and various aspects of public sector management, with a particular focus on [[caf_common_assessment_framework | Common Assessment Framework (CAF)]] and [[Talent management in multigenerational workforces | human resource management]]. A live poll conducted during the session revealed that participants believe human resource management is the area most impacted by the use of CAF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

## CAF's Role in Human Resource Management

The [[caf_common_assessment_framework | CAF model]] helps organizations prepare for uncertainties by fostering constant learning and understanding their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This holistic approach impacts the mindset of both the organization and its staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Eva Selectum from Vienna emphasizes that CAF acts as a coach towards organizational development and the development of culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>, including fostering a new culture where everyone makes a difference and is motivated towards continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

Gracia Barba Rivas, head of the European CAF Center, notes that the 2020 CAF model explicitly includes "innovation" 50 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a> and reinforces it as a principle of excellence: "continued learning, innovation, and improvement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. Criterion 2.4, "manage change and innovation in an agile way," specifically addresses this within the framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

## Impact and Findings from Slovenia

Slovenia recently completed a study on the impact of [[caf_common_assessment_framework | CAF implementation]] on [[Talent management in multigenerational workforces | human resource management]] and the "people" criteria within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. This study measured a significant impact, validating the poll results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26">[01:11:26]</a>.

Gracia Barba Rivas affirmed that the study's main conclusions indicate a major impact of CAF on [[Talent management in multigenerational workforces | human resource management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. She stressed the importance of drawing lessons from the COVID-19 crisis regarding human resource management, as weaknesses were identified, and improvements are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. The CAF model aids organizations in making these improvements step by step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>.

Xenia Hafner from the Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and Sports shared an example of how their initial CAF self-assessment led to an employee survey to understand satisfaction, climate, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. This initiative evolved into a collaborative effort with other public bodies to create a uniform methodology for employee surveys, allowing for comparisons and identifying areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>. The questionnaire focused on actionable items that could be implemented in an action plan, making it a valuable management tool for strategic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

## Future Considerations for Human Resource Management

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for public administrations to strengthen their resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. This includes cultivating skills and capabilities among public sector employees to solve complex problems and innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. Sarah Faison from the OECD noted that the [[caf_common_assessment_framework | CAF model]] can help assess how organizations have adapted their HR policies and strategies in response to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

The lessons learned from the crisis indicate that human resource management must adapt to new working methods, such as remote and hybrid models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>. This shift impacts various areas, including [[Organizational Habits and Futures Thinking | knowledge management strategies]], which become more complex with remote working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>. A survey of [[caf_common_assessment_framework | CAF users]] is currently underway to identify main challenges faced by public sector organizations and draw further lessons related to the model's application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

The ongoing focus is on using [[caf_common_assessment_framework | CAF]] to position public sector organizations to overcome disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, particularly in the context of [[Talent management in multigenerational workforces | human resource management]].

Innovation often presents significant [[overcoming_innovation_challenges | challenges]], but strategic approaches to ideation, proposal development, and managing expectations can lead to successful outcomes. It's crucial to understand the context, rally support, and anticipate potential hurdles.

## From Problem Framing to Ideation

Before identifying solutions, it's essential to frame the problem correctly to avoid subpar results [00:00:04]. Ideation is not just about sticky notes on a wall; it requires strategic thinking and consideration of the operational context [00:00:32]. The goal is to generate "good ideas" and then effectively narrow them down for testing [00:00:52].

## Developing Innovation Proposals

An [[developing_innovation_proposals | innovation proposal]] transforms an idea into something actionable [00:01:33]. Regardless of an idea's brilliance, it requires development and needs to fit within the real-world context [00:01:41]. There isn't a single "magical answer" for what a proposal should look like or how it can succeed, as it's highly dependent on context [00:02:08]. However, commonalities exist, whether it's an informal email, prototyping with colleagues, or an official budget request [00:02:16].

Presenting an innovation proposal can be a nerve-wracking experience, as it's a moment to validate an idea or secure necessary resources [00:02:57].

## Tips for Successful Public Sector Innovation Proposals

Developing successful innovation proposals, particularly in the public sector, involves several key considerations:

### Understand the Strategic Context
Even the best ideas won't gain traction if the strategic context isn't right [00:03:47]. It's vital to appreciate what else is happening within the organization and identify related agendas or political messages that your idea can align with [00:04:06]. Framing or reframing your idea to better match the context, or at least appear to, can be crucial [00:04:23].

### Rally People to Your Cause
Innovation is new, meaning there are often no ready mental models or examples for people to understand [00:04:41]. Effective communication, tailored to your audience's preferences, is key [00:04:56]. Consider how decision-makers prefer information (data, stories, peer examples) [00:05:03]. Also, identify the most effective voice for your proposal; sometimes, it might be someone other than yourself who can advocate more strongly [00:05:42].

### Don't Assume the Merits Are Apparent
Novel ideas can easily be misinterpreted [00:06:15]. Your personal experience or research may not be enough to convince others [00:06:27]. To make your proposal real and meaningful:
*   **Prototyping**: Make it visible and tangible [00:06:48].
*   **Peer Voices**: Find others who can support and sell the idea [00:06:53].
*   **Concrete Use Cases**: Point to existing problems, current solution failures, and examples of similar initiatives working elsewhere [00:06:57].
*   **Scenario Thinking**: Look to the future and consider how things might play out in different scenarios [00:07:15].

### Know Your Numbers
Have a strong understanding of what you're asking for, why, and the expected results [00:07:31]. Be prepared for questions, especially since the burden of proof for innovation is often higher than for the status quo [00:08:02]. Consider:
*   The cost and risks of the current approach [00:08:21].
*   Starting small with a test case [00:08:42].
*   Promising with confidence, even with future uncertainty [00:08:54].
*   Pointing to successful examples from other agencies, countries, or the private sector [00:09:18].

### Nothing is Certain â€“ Be Ready for the Unexpected
Always consider "what if" scenarios [00:09:51]. Think about what you'll do if the proposal is approved, if it scales unexpectedly, or if new information undercuts your hypothesis [00:09:57].

### Maximize Your Chances
While "fast failure" is discussed in innovation, the public sector prioritizes results [00:10:31]. Demonstrate value even if the core idea doesn't work as expected [00:10:47]. Identify other potential benefits, such as learning outcomes or developing relationships with stakeholders [00:10:59]. Focus on [[Challenges_of_a_multifaceted_innovation_approach | multiple payoffs]] [00:11:23].

### Be Open to Change
Leave space in your proposal for input from decision-makers [00:11:36]. Senior leaders often want to add their perspective and experience, so building this into the process is important [00:12:00].

## Common Issues with Innovation Proposals

Even well-crafted proposals can face common pitfalls:

### Do Decision-Makers Truly Understand?
Sometimes, despite clear communication, decision-makers may not fully grasp the innovative nature or implications of what they've agreed to [00:18:33]. This is often because the idea is new, leading to misinterpretations or different expectations [00:19:02]. Watching for warning signs is important, as you can't get inside their heads [00:19:24].

### Flexibility for the Unexpected
Innovation projects will almost certainly encounter unexpected issues [00:19:51]. Avoid building critical dependencies into the proposal that make you vulnerable to surprises [00:20:03]. Being too specific without leaving room for adaptation can lead to trouble [00:20:13].

### Building an Escape Clause
Consider how to disengage from a project if it doesn't meet expectations [00:20:38]. The public sector often has a tendency to continue investing in projects even when they aren't working [00:21:03]. An escape clause can also be beneficial if the project veers in an unwanted direction or becomes solely dependent on you for sustainability [00:21:19].

### Finding the Right Balance of Information
Avoid patronizing decision-makers, but also don't assume they know everything, especially if the idea is new [00:22:36]. Testing your proposal with a diverse group of people (deeply familiar and loosely familiar) can help find the right balance of information [00:23:02].

### Beware of Scope Creep
Scope creep can manifest in two ways:
1.  **Adding too much**: The project becomes unrecognizable due to too many additions [00:23:20]. This is dangerous for innovations trying to test a few key things [00:23:37].
2.  **Cutting critical parts**: Essential, innovative elements are removed, leaving a project that no longer resembles the original innovative concept [00:23:42].

Identifying critical dependencies within the proposal can help manage this risk [00:24:06].

### Managing Uncertainty and Time
When the impact of innovation is uncertain, and you don't know how long it will take to reach the desired impact, prototyping and low-fidelity testing are crucial [00:25:02]. This involves activities like creating wireframes for websites or play-acting service interactions to gather early feedback and flesh out the reality of the proposal, revealing dependencies and time elements [00:25:20].

### Getting Started with Limited Risk
To begin the [[developing_innovation_proposals | innovation proposal]] process with minimal risk:
1.  **Know your context**: Innovation approaches differ significantly between countries and organizational settings [00:26:54].
2.  **Do low or no-cost tests**: Instead of full mock-ups, use simple methods like paper prototypes to gather reactions and validate hypotheses before the formal proposal stage [00:27:17].
3.  **Start small**: Utilize your own discretion within your job context to run experiments without requiring permission [00:28:54]. This builds confidence and comfort in pushing innovation [00:29:12].

### Managing Expectations and Buzzwords
Governments often use "innovation" as a buzzword, leading to potential misalignments between project reality and leadership expectations [00:30:08]. To manage these expectations, especially upwards:
*   **Build a common language**: Help the organization understand that innovation is inherently uncertain and can be uncomfortable [00:31:06]. If these elements are absent, it's likely "innovation theater" rather than true innovation [00:31:16].
*   **Bring in other voices**: Stakeholders, partner organizations, or other agencies experienced in innovative projects can help shape more realistic and nuanced expectations [00:32:08].
*   **Political cover**: While risky if leadership changes, finding key leaders who support the initiative can sometimes smooth the path [00:32:38].

### Dealing with Rejection
When an innovation proposal is rejected despite strong belief in its merit:
*   **Wait for the right time**: Sometimes, it's a matter of timing [00:16:57].
*   **Reframe the idea**: Adapt it to better suit the current context, listening to political signals [00:17:04].
*   **Build a coalition**: If you're too far ahead of your audience, work to bring others along and build support [00:17:20].
*   **Find outside voices**: External stakeholders or experts can advocate for the idea [00:17:40].
*   **Lateral thinking**: Sometimes, it means finding workarounds or other sponsors [00:18:00].
*   **Recognize when to move on**: There are times when an idea simply won't happen in the current context, and it's best to wait [00:18:06].
*   **Personal strategies**: Develop your own limits for how many times you will push an idea [00:33:44].
*   **Ask questions**: Understand why the idea isn't resonating with decision-makers [00:34:26].

### Communicating Failure
The concept of "failure" in innovation, particularly in government, is often misunderstood [00:36:01].
*   **Reframe failure as learning**: Instead of admitting failure, emphasize that testing small with limited exposure provides valuable learning, especially in high uncertainty environments [00:36:13].
*   **Multiple goals**: Ensure that learning is a clear goal from the outset, especially when outcomes are uncertain [00:36:56].
*   **Shades of success and failure**: The line between success and failure can be thin, often influenced by external, unrelated events [00:37:32]. Innovation inherently involves chance due to uncertainty [00:38:08].
*   **Deliver something**: The most important thing is to deliver some value, even if the primary objective isn't met, to maximize payoffs from every effort [00:39:31].

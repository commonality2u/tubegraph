The "International Conference on Governments beyond Recovery and Towards the Future Fit Public Sector" is a virtual event hosted by the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU, the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, and the European Institute of Public Administration, with support from the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Over two days, the conference brings together policymakers, practitioners, regulators, civil society representatives, private sector actors, and innovators to explore opportunities for public governance as the world emerges from crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The aim is to explore how [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]], adaptation, strategic foresight, and co-creation can shape a better future for governments, societies, and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Role of Innovation in Crisis Response

The conference's discussions reflect on how [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] and inclusion can serve as pillars of governance as governments work to shape recovery efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>. Governments were significantly challenged by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with bold and decisive responses proving crucial in supporting businesses, households, and saving lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>. Public support provided by governments across the OECD, through increased spending, foregone taxes, and business loans, amounted to a massive 27% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.

Matthias Cormann, Secretary-General of the OECD, highlights that extensive policy support, rapid vaccine development, and accelerating digital transformation have all contributed to a more optimistic economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>. However, the recovery remains uneven, and new virus outbreaks are a significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>. Looking ahead, focus must be on immediate and medium-to-longer term priorities, including optimizing recovery strength and quality, dealing with climate change, seizing digital transformation opportunities, and strengthening global markets and international cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. Public sectors need to strategically embed [[the_role_of_public_sector_innovation_in_crisis_response | innovation]] and foresight at the heart of policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, a commitment core to the OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation adopted by 43 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>.

## Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined existing challenges and brought new ones into focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. A key lesson learned is the importance of preparedness and flexibility in response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. While some countries were well-prepared due to past experiences or taking recommendations seriously, many, including Slovenia, were not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. The initial European response was characterized by disorganization and chaos, with borders closing and supply chain issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. However, subsequent phases, particularly regarding recovery funds and financial support for vaccine development, became a success story due to improved coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

### Petra Maidich: Inspiration from Sports
Former cross-country skiing champion Petra Maidich, now a successful businesswoman, offered an inspirational account of [[resilience_and_innovation_in_pandemic_response | resilience and innovation]].
*   **Teamwork:** Despite being an individual sport, Maidich emphasized "we and us" over "me and I," always speaking about her team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. She prioritized building a dependable and trustworthy team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This reliance was critical when she won an Olympic medal in Vancouver with five broken ribs, an achievement she credits entirely to her team who supported and motivated her for five hours after her fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Innovation and Differentiation:** As an athlete from a small country with limited resources compared to nations like Norway or Sweden, Maidich was "forced to find innovative ways" to get similar training conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Her team innovated racing suits by using vibrant colors instead of the traditional blue, red, black, and white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This made her highly visible, thrilled sponsors, attracted new ones, and was never copied, leading her to realize that "dare to be different is not a handicap but it's an opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Adaptation and Learning from Failure:** Maidich notes that children are like "human chameleons," capable of constant transformation, but adults become afraid of failing, losing their flexible and [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovative]] thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Her own sports career, which involved facing unexpected changes and challenges "every single season," instilled in her the need to be adaptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This preparation meant her business career was not significantly affected by COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. A pivotal lesson came from her coach after she quit a race at 13: quitting, he explained, was disrespectful and would lead to a fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This taught her to "never take status quo for granted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Integrity:** Maidich emphasizes that integrity has driven her through all her life experiences, from being a top athlete to facing business challenges, and believes it's a value everyone should follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>.

### Government Innovation during COVID-19
Slovenia, not initially prepared for the pandemic, had to implement real [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovations]] at the governmental level, such as swiftly passing legislative packages to tackle various issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>. Without these procedures, the country would have suffered much more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>. A specific [[innovative_responses_to_covid19_by_governments | innovation]] from Slovenia was a company called Bia Separations, which developed technology for purifying vaccines, leading to more secure shots at lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>.

## Key Principles for Innovation in Government

### Flexibility and Preparedness
The pandemic highlighted that systems, particularly in democracies, that can quickly implement measures without extensive parliamentary approval were more effective in the initial response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. However, countries with free markets, freedom, and democracy were ultimately responsible for the [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] needed to develop effective vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. Future challenges require democracies to be more [[resilience_and_innovation_in_pandemic_response | resilient]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.

### Digital Transformation
Digital transformation can significantly aid future responses. If all data were available online and shared across countries (e.g., within the EU or OECD), responses to crises could be "much better, much on time and much more targeted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. Technology is an enabler, but people's mindset and ability to use it effectively are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

### People-Centric Approach
Marco Ongaro, Director General of the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA), emphasizes that "what matters really is people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. People drive changes, reorganizations, and [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. The crisis showed the indispensable role of often "invisible" professions like nurses, supermarket clerks, and truck drivers, who became everyday heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. Their voices, alongside researchers and scientists, must be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. For public administration, this means thinking differently, bringing diverse people into organizations, and recruiting for [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]], change management, and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.

### Investing in Innovation and Education
Investing in [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] is fundamental for the future, particularly in healthcare and climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. Innovation is increasingly happening in diverse areas, with startups playing a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. This calls for an ecosystem approach where knowledge and talent from academia, the strengths of the private sector, and public funding and legal frameworks come together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. There is a continuous need for education and training, with individuals needing to be retrained multiple times throughout their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Future Crises

The world faces not only pandemics but also other serious challenges like cyber attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. If these challenges were to occur simultaneously, the impact on the public sector could be immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. The pandemic should serve as a "call to awareness" to be more prepared for such situations and take warning signals seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>.

### Trust in Science and Global Coordination
There's a concerning division in Europe regarding trust in science, with Western Europe showing higher trust than Central or Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. This lack of trust can hinder decisions, especially for long-term issues like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. Climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>, and Europe is leading by setting ambitious goals like CO2 neutrality by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>. However, achieving this requires significant investment in [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] and technologies for clean energy, such as finding alternatives to lithium-based batteries for electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>. The challenge for the [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | public sector]] is to secure funds for these "invisible" investments, especially when public trust in science is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.

### Sharing Knowledge and Overcoming Barriers
While Europe possesses a "huge treasure" of diverse solutions and good practices across its member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>, this knowledge is not exploited enough due to bureaucratic obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. European institutions and programs like Erasmus facilitate knowledge distribution, but barriers hinder full exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>. Empowering people in public administration to improve things, monitoring progress, and driving for quality, along with changing recruitment and promotion practices to be more open to external talent, can help overcome these barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.

## Outlook

There is a commitment to foster public sectors that strategically embed [[the_role_of_public_sector_innovation_in_crisis_response | innovation]] and foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The goal is to be better prepared for future challenges by creating an "innovation friendly" society within Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:45">[01:21:45]</a>. This involves teaching citizens from a young age how to use and prioritize information effectively, and developing skills to apply that information for the common good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:22:17]</a>. Enhanced cooperation and knowledge sharing between countries will be key to addressing future complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>.

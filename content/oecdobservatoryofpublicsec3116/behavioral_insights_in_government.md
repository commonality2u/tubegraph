[[Behavioral insights | Behavioral insights]] (BI), often referred to as "nudges" in many countries, involve governments understanding human motivations to influence behavior towards desirable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. While not entirely new, their application is maturing and being used in novel ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Growth and Application
Government-related [[Behavioral Insights | behavioral insights]] units have significantly expanded, now exceeding 200 organizations across governments in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. These insights are used to nudge citizens towards actions such as paying taxes on time or contributing more to retirement accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Integration with Gamification
A key trend is the merger of [[Behavioral Insights | behavioral insights]] with gamification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This combination allows governments to better understand the motivations and perspectives of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

### Carrot Rewards Example
Carrot Rewards, Canada's national wellness rewards platform, exemplifies this integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. The app rewards users for healthy behaviors like meeting walking goals or completing quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Points earned can be redeemed through Canada's popular loyalty programs, which about 90% of Canadians are subscribed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

This initiative aimed to address rising healthcare costs and promote the wellness of Canadian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. The app has also partnered with health campaigns, such as a flu campaign, where push notifications and geo-localization quizzes helped remind and direct users to get their flu shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. This campaign resulted in 30,000 people receiving the flu shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

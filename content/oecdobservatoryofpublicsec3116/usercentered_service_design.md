The delivery of public services in the digital age requires a focus on the user. It is crucial to consider the expectations and needs of the final users when making the most of digital opportunities to design and deliver services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This approach ensures that services are inclusive and build trust in public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Key Principles of User-Centered Design

### Omnichannel Approach
While citizens increasingly expect government services to be digital by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, it is vital not to forget those who cannot or simply do not wish to use digital channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. A [[Usercentric design and implementation | digital by default]] mindset can limit thinking, leading to disconnected experiences if digital and traditional services are treated as entirely separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Good services support multiple channels and allow users to switch between them throughout their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This includes maintaining physical access points, as a significant portion of the population may not be comfortable with digital services, lack access to computers, or simply prefer non-digital interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

Portugal, for example, has developed a widespread service network of "citizen shops" and "citizen spaces" where people can receive assistance from trained mediators to use digital services or improve their digital skills, ensuring no one is left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. These centers enable citizens to access services offline while also promoting digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. An omnichannel approach allows citizens to initiate contact through one channel and complete it through another, requiring cross-agency technology for fast access to user information and interaction history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.

### User Research and Engagement
[[Humancentered design in public services | User research]] is fundamental to designing services that are usable, useful, and thoughtful for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. This involves:
*   Talking to people and confronting services with specific user types, such as farmers for agricultural services, to understand their context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.
*   Focusing on citizens' real needs and incorporating their feedback throughout all stages of service development and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   Including users in the design, [[cocreation with stakeholders | co-creation]], and testing phases, and even after services are released, using analytical tools to measure usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.
*   Conducting research with a broad range of users, including those less comfortable with digital, to inform service design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.
*   Observing citizens in mediation centers to understand how they use digital channels and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.

### Clear Communication and Language
Governments must communicate effectively about service opportunities, making information accessible and understandable to everyone, including those with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Simplifying language and avoiding technical jargon is crucial, as citizens may not understand public organization structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. France, for instance, used "Facile à Lire et à Comprendre" (FALC – Easy to Read and Understand) for its COVID-19 tracker application, ensuring maximum accessibility and transparency about data use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

### Data Utilization and Transparency
Efficient use of data is extremely important for maximizing the benefits of digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. This involves:
*   Pre-filling application forms with data from central registers, implementing a "once-only" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.
*   Efficient data exchange in the background, minimizing user interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.
*   Establishing multi-purpose data exchange platforms that unify communication channels for data requesters and owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>.
*   Ensuring legal compliance and ethical acceptability for data processing, with clear standards for purpose and reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.
*   Demonstrating transparency of data use to build citizens' trust in service providers and public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. External institutions, like Slovenia's Information Commissioner, can help calm public debate and build trust by performing regular checks and audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.
*   Giving citizens control over their data and transparency about how it is used by different government departments, potentially through a single digital account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.

### Skills and Collaboration
The [[Design thinking and humancentered design | digital mindset]] within government requires a mix of skills and agile ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. Public servants need digital skills to build in-house solutions and procure effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. [[Collaboration and governance in digital services | Collaboration across government]] departments is essential because services, from a user's perspective, do not stop at departmental boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Using shared components and platforms, like the UK's notification platform or design patterns, accelerates service development and unifies user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Investment in the knowledge and skills of service providers, systematically improved through training like Slovenia's Administration Academy, fosters a modern business culture with improved cooperation and user focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

## Challenges and Solutions
*   **Overcoming Silos:** Connecting different silos within public sector organizations is a persistent challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. A single domain for government, like GOV.UK, can simplify government by forcing departments to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Institutional networks and common components also support collaboration across administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>.
*   **Digital Literacy:** A significant portion of the population may not have the digital skills to access advanced services remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Programs like France's "digital pass" offer coupons for classes to increase digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. Slovenia is introducing digital vouchers and computer science subjects in schools as long-term investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Improvements:** France's "Observatory of Digital Public Services" monitors 250 high-volume digital services using seven criteria (e.g., mobile accessibility, disability access, data reuse) to assess quality and prioritize improvements every three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. A key indicator is user satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.
*   **Expert Deployment:** France deployed "UX commandos" (user experience commandos) – teams of experts (designers, developers, user researchers, data scientists) – into existing services to work on specific key performance indicators, improving accessibility or satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. This approach not only improved services but also changed how teams think about producing digital services, promoting user testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.
*   **Managing Complexity:** Digital services, if not properly designed with the right methods and experts, can increase complexity for users and providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. The goal is to remove complexity for the user by building sophisticated, secure, and interoperable back-end systems that remain hidden from the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.

## Moving Forward
The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for governments to be both agile in emergencies and adopt systematic approaches for long-term service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Future efforts will focus on:
*   Accelerating [[innovative public service design | digital government]] by providing a common framework for design and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.
*   Improving data utilization and [[Enhancement Oriented Innovation | data science]] for faster understanding and more agile responses in future emergency situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>.
*   Pushing for greater inclusivity in service design, influencing leaders to prioritize changing methodologies within their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>.
*   Introducing more [[Design thinking and humancentered design | design thinking]], [[cocreation with stakeholders | co-creation]], collaboration, coordination, and inclusiveness, while focusing on skills and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>.
*   Ensuring that being digital means providing a consistent experience across all channels, managing the risk of exclusion, and building a successful journey for all citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>.

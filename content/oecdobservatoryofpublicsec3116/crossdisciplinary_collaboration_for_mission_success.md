Mission-oriented innovation fundamentally requires a coordinated approach that spans various policy fields, sectors, and disciplines to address societal challenges effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This systemic policy approach necessitates collaboration beyond traditional silos to achieve ambitious, measurable goals within defined timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Challenges in Policy Coordination

A major challenge in mission-oriented innovation is coordinating public and private actors across disciplinary, sectoral, and policy silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This includes engaging policy bodies beyond the traditional Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) area, reaching out to sectoral ministries and regulatory bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Coordinating actors across different levels of governance is also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Establishing an effective governance structure can be complex and demands significant understanding and negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## OECD's Mission Lab Initiative

The OECD's "Mission Lab" is a [[collaborative_governance_and_breaking_silos_in_mission_implementation | cross-directorate initiative]] designed to help policymakers and stakeholders implement missions by addressing these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. The initiative aims to "bust silos" within the OECD itself and promote [[interdisciplinary_collaboration_in_government_rulemaking | cross-disciplinary collaboration]] across countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

## International Development Context

In low and middle-income countries, addressing complex challenges often requires [[international_collaboration_during_crises | cross-sectoral work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Existing coordination mechanisms, such as the UN coordination system or humanitarian cluster systems, need to be assessed for their suitability in advancing cross-sectoral efforts without simply mimicking approaches from elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. The involvement of bilateral development providers, multilateral institutions, and national governments adds significant complexity to mission formulation and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

## Country-Specific Examples of Cross-disciplinary Collaboration

### Australia (CSIRO)
CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, designs its missions as coordinated packages mobilizing science, technology, and innovation, incorporating [[interdisciplinary_collaboration_in_government_rulemaking | cross-disciplinary engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>. Their model aims to "crowd in" resources from industry, government, research, and civil society, requiring coordination across the entire innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. A key challenge is scaling up these efforts and ensuring ongoing monitoring and evaluation frameworks are in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.

### Norway (Research Council of Norway)
Norway's "Pilot-E" scheme emerged from a bottom-up, inter-agency initiative where individuals from different agencies linked their tools to achieve better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. This entrepreneurial spirit helped overcome formal and cultural issues between agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. However, scaling up these initiatives reveals challenges due to differing agency cultures, ways of working, and formal legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. For larger societal challenges, Norway recognizes the need for a "whole-of-government approach" to transform industrial structures, which requires broad political agreement and cross-sectoral collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.

### Vietnam (UNDP)
UNDP Vietnam's "Deep Demonstration" initiative focuses on facilitating new approaches to address complex challenges, moving beyond single-point solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:58">[00:51:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>. Their work on circular economy transitions involves engaging diverse actors—businesses, NGOs, citizens, and the waste management system—and requires breaking down inter-ministerial and departmental silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. They utilize a "studio approach" for "sense-making," bringing together individuals with diverse backgrounds (architects, journalists, economists, biologists) to deeply understand the underlying drivers of complex issues like the linear economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:35">[01:23:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>. Learning from Vietnam's agile and silo-breaking response to COVID-19 highlights the potential for rapid, [[international_and_local_collaboration_in_crisis_management | collaborative action]] when treated as an emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:36">[01:25:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:05">[01:26:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:08">[01:26:08]</a>.

### Denmark (Innovation Fund Denmark)
Denmark's first mission-driven program involves "big partnerships" with universities, industry, and cluster organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>. A key challenge is achieving full stakeholder involvement, as different groups (e.g., researchers) may have competing interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. The program also grapples with combining science policy with demand-side policies (like consumer behavior and regulation) to ensure technological advancements translate into real-world solutions and are not just "yet another big partnership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>.# Cross-disciplinary Collaboration for Mission Success

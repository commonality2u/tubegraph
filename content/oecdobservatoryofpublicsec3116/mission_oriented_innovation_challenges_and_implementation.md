This article explores the challenges and practical implementation of [[Mission oriented innovation]], drawing insights from a webinar co-hosted by the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, the OECD Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation, and the OECD Development Cooperation Directorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a>. The core purpose of the discussion was to delve into the complexities of operationalizing ambitious missions and experimenting to make them work in practice, especially concerning long-term governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56"></a>.

## Defining [[Mission Oriented Innovation]]

The OECD defines [[Mission oriented innovation]] policy as a coordinated package of policy and regulatory measures specifically tailored to mobilize science, technology, and innovation (and more) to address societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19"></a>. This package of measures:
*   Spans several stages of the innovation cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38"></a>.
*   Uses different policy instruments, from supply-side to demand-side, and includes regulatory measures (top-down and bottom-up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40"></a>.
*   Crosses different policy fields, sectors, and disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48"></a>.
*   Is targeted towards ambitious, bold, and concrete measurable goals to be met within a defined timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52"></a>.

The OECD's understanding of [[Mission oriented innovation]] policy rests on three main dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06"></a>:
1.  Strategic Orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10"></a>
2.  Policy Coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12"></a>
3.  Policy Implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13"></a>

## [[Challenges and strategies in implementing innovation]]

### Strategic Orientation
The primary challenge is creating a broad consensus on selected societal challenges and translating them into clear, bold objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29"></a>. Key questions include:
*   How to create customized, tailored missions for each specific situation, considering scope, depth, granularity, focus, and boldness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15"></a>.
*   How to secure and balance the involvement of diverse stakeholders, such as politicians, experts, and policymakers, without diluting or inflating the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35"></a>.
*   How to engage beyond traditional actors, including citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44"></a>.

### Policy Coordination
The main hurdle here is coordinating public and private actors across disciplinary, sectoral, and policy silos to work towards commonly agreed missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05"></a>. This involves:
*   Engaging policy bodies beyond the traditional Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) area, reaching out to sectoral ministries and regulatory bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23"></a>.
*   Coordinating actors across different levels of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43"></a>.
*   Establishing complex governance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50"></a>.

### Policy Implementation
This dimension focuses on the practical application of complementary policy and regulatory instruments to achieve objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24"></a>. Challenges include:
*   Connecting supply-side and demand-side instruments in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36"></a>.
*   Managing "solution portfolios" where missions are "solution neutral" (picking the problem, not the solution), requiring significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10"></a>.
*   Monitoring and evaluating systemic policies effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22"></a>.

### The "Bright Side" of Missions
Despite these difficulties, [[Mission oriented innovation]] policies offer a dedicated and tailored space for collective action that is adaptable to each area and institutional setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09"></a>. They allow for the co-creation of objectives and targets, the setup of specific governance structures, and the design and implementation of an intentional policy mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32"></a>. This systemic policy approach is best developed gradually through experimentation and learning, rather than being implemented all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45"></a>.

## The Mission Actions Lab
The OECD is launching a "Mission Actions Lab" to address these challenges and support practical implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59"></a>. The lab aims to:
*   Work on the challenge of operationalizing missions in practice to ensure they realize their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13"></a>.
*   Participate in mission creation and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration across countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38"></a>.
*   Select three to four demonstration cases across different mission areas and types starting from Autumn 2021/2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34"></a>.
*   Work on the ground to deliver products and services, test new ways of coordination and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52"></a>.
*   Foster a community angle and knowledge sharing, including with low and middle-income countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17"></a>.

## [[Missionoriented innovation and its role in transformative change]]: Perspectives and Challenges

### Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)
The OECD's Development Cooperation Directorate is researching [[Mission oriented innovation]] in LMICs, often in partnership with organizations like University College London's Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40"></a>. While LMICs share characteristics with high-income countries in addressing complex challenges, important differentiators exist:

*   **Type of Problem**: Missions can address "complicated" problems (e.g., connecting all schools to the internet) or "complex" challenges (e.g., Family Planning 2030, which requires technical innovation and changes in gender norms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21"></a>.
*   **Scale**: Missions can be global (e.g., GAVI for vaccines) or national/place-based (e.g., fiber optic cable in Colombia, circular economies at city level) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22"></a>.
*   **Actor Involvement**: A significant layer of complexity comes from the involvement of bilateral development providers, multilateral institutions (including International Financial Institutions), national governments, and social movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48"></a>.

Specific challenges in LMICs for [[Mission oriented innovation]]:
*   **Strategic Orientation**: The degree to which a mission is localized and owned by national actors versus originating externally is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21"></a>. Missions also need to reflect the capabilities of the national innovation ecosystem, often requiring tech transfer models as an integral part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51"></a>.
*   **Policy Coordination**: Existing international development and humanitarian coordination mechanisms need to be assessed for their fitness to advance cross-sectoral work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21"></a>. A key pitfall is "morphing mimicry," where approaches from elsewhere are adopted without deep institutional transformations in coordination processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56"></a>.
*   **Policy Implementation**: The "projectification" of development work accentuates challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20"></a>. Securing long-term commitment is difficult due to uncertainty from international actors and changing global priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36"></a>. The established practice of single-implementation projects conflicts with the [[Mission oriented innovation]] premise of investing in competing solutions to drive change across sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06"></a>.

### Country and Organizational Perspectives

#### CSIRO (Australia)
CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, sees missions as coordinated packages of projects mobilizing science, technology, and innovation to address well-defined societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00"></a>. Unlike some European models, CSIRO's approach does not rely on a central pool of government funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40"></a>. Instead, it aims to "crowd in" existing financial and other resources from industry, government, research, and civil society stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50"></a>. A key characteristic is balancing the imperative to coordinate efforts across the innovation system with the need to bring in external revenue for the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04"></a>.

CSIRO has 12 mission candidates addressing six societal challenges, focusing on areas where CSIRO has core science and technology capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17"></a>. Four missions have been formally launched, committing to a five-to-seven-year program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33"></a>:
*   **Hydrogen Industry Mission**: Enable a globally competitive Australian hydrogen industry, targeting $2 per kilo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00"></a>.
*   **Future Protein Mission**: Leverage global demand for high-quality protein to grow Australia's protein industry by $10 billion by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23"></a>.
*   **Trusted Agri-foods Mission**: Increase the value of Australian food exports by $10 billion by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40"></a>.
*   **Drought Resilience Mission**: Reduce negative impacts of drought by 30% by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49"></a>.

**Implementation Challenges for CSIRO**:
*   **Scaling Up**: After the initial launch phase, the challenge is to scale up effectively, as mission leads may perceive the hard work as done. There is a lack of clear signposts beyond impact pathways and program logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35"></a>.
*   **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Questions remain about incentives, ongoing monitoring and evaluation frameworks, and when to intervene if programs are not delivering outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05"></a>.
*   **Integration with non-mission work**: As missions aim to drive a third of CSIRO's external revenue, the challenge is to articulate alternative pathways for the two-thirds of activity that is not mission-related, distinguishing between mission-aligned activities and normal research discoveries or spin-out companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39"></a>.

#### Research Council of Norway (RCN)
RCN has experience with "accelerated missions" through its pilot-e scheme, which developed organically from inter-agency collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01"></a>. This scheme links tools from different agencies to achieve better services and results, such as developing electric ferries to reduce carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13"></a>. These bottom-up initiatives benefit from an entrepreneurial spirit and local drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45"></a>.

RCN is now focused on "scaling up" these concepts into new areas, such as healthcare, where different actors (municipalities, hospitals) require adapted ways of working and different incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50"></a>. The next level involves a "level up" to a whole-of-government approach for transformational missions, particularly for Norway's transition away from oil and gas dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37"></a>.

**Implementation Challenges for RCN**:
*   **Cultural Differences and Formal Issues**: Scaling up bottom-up initiatives exposes different organizational cultures and formal legal issues between agencies (e.g., publicizing applicant names), which were easier to navigate at a small scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09"></a>.
*   **Political and Prestige Involvement**: As initiatives scale and involve ministries and politicians, complexity increases, and prestige issues become more prevalent, potentially hindering practical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08"></a>.
*   **Portfolio Management**: RCN is using a portfolio management system to monitor and capture all relevant activities, tagging projects across programs and budgets to avoid duplication and identify gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50"></a>.
*   **Alignment with European/Global Missions**: There's a challenge in connecting national missions with broader European or global initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51"></a>.

#### UNDP Vietnam
UNDP Vietnam's "Deep Demonstrations" initiative addresses the "relevance gap" arising from complex, fast-moving social and environmental challenges that traditional development organizations are not designed for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09"></a>. They aim to design and implement development interventions in new ways, focusing on systems change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04"></a>. An example is addressing plastic waste and transitioning to a circular economy in Vietnam, where the linear economy logic and rapidly changing financial frameworks (declining grants, increasing FDI) present challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27"></a>.

**Implementation Challenges for UNDP Vietnam**:
*   **Portfolio Sense-Making**: UNDP uses portfolio sense-making, an iterative process to learn rapidly and extract insights from existing projects, leveraging current resources to identify acceleration opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18"></a>. The challenge is ensuring interventions are coherent, learn from each other, and have a system-wide impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56"></a>.
*   **Creating a Movement**: In city-level initiatives (e.g., Da Nang's circular economy efforts), there was an underestimation of the need to create a "movement" and buy-in through necessary awareness-building, requiring local engagement and critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46"></a>.
*   **Cross-Ministerial/Departmental Coordination**: Bringing different government departments and ministries together around a shared mission is a core challenge, especially in contexts like Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09"></a>.
*   **Adaptable Portfolios**: The need for portfolios of interventions to adapt to unexpected learnings during implementation is critical, yet current mechanisms and development project prototypes often do not allow for the necessary flexibility to pivot strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50"></a>.
*   **Reframing the Challenge**: Using collaborative, design-led approaches (e.g., "studio approach" with diverse backgrounds) to deeply understand underlying drivers of challenges and reframe them (e.g., circular economy as an emergency or future-proofing strategy for economic resilience) is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:18"></a>. This helps in engaging non-traditional actors and considering economic incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46"></a>.

#### Innovation Fund Denmark
The Innovation Fund Denmark is implementing Denmark's first real [[Mission oriented innovation]] program, with 700 million Cronos (approx. €100 million) allocated for four green missions: PTX, carbon capture, agriculture/food, and circular economy/plastic/textiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21"></a>. The approach involves asking stakeholders (universities, industry, cluster organizations) to define roadmaps, then selecting and combining these for calls for partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11"></a>. This rapid prototyping approach is being conducted on a very tight timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48"></a>.

**Implementation Challenges for Innovation Fund Denmark**:
*   **Measuring Impact**: Difficulty in measuring the impact of different roadmaps, especially with a lack of standardized measures and the need to compare diverse objectives like greenhouse gas reduction and competitiveness for Danish companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02"></a>.
*   **Stakeholder Engagement and Conflict**: Difficulties in involving all stakeholders simultaneously, with some "battling" occurring, particularly on the research side, driven by funding interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04"></a>.
*   **Balancing Focus and Agility**: Maintaining focus on the roadmap while retaining agility to adapt to a changing world and incentivize new partners (companies, researchers) to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36"></a>.
*   **Stopping Projects**: The lack of a method (legally and culturally) for stopping projects that are not progressing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00"></a>.
*   **Industry Involvement**: Incentivizing greater industry involvement, as the allocated funds are insufficient to solve the big mission problems alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22"></a>.
*   **Integrating Demand-Side Policies**: Combining science policy with demand-side policies like consumer behavior and regulation to ensure that fantastic technology ideas actually solve the problems in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49"></a>.

These insights highlight the complexities of translating [[Mission oriented innovation]] from concept to practice, requiring flexible governance structures, continuous learning, and effective cross-sectoral and cross-level coordination.

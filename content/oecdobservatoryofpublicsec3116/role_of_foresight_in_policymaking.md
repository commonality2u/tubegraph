In an era marked by significant global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts like the war in Ukraine, an energy crisis, and high inflation, the future appears uncertain and "misty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This environment, however, presents a critical opportunity to build more resilient public sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Public sectors are considered the cornerstone for citizens in difficult situations, necessitating a proactive approach to tackling emerging issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Defining Anticipatory Innovation and Foresight

[[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | Anticipatory innovation and strategic foresight]] are recognized as essential elements of public administration, especially as citizens turn to public authorities during times of change and crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. At its core, "anticipation" involves creating knowledge about the future and making decisions based on that knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. This means taking action today based on future outlooks, which requires a robust governance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. Key components include:

*   **Agency:** The ability of governments to utilize diverse tools and methods to make sense of the future, explore different scenarios, and translate findings into innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Authorizing Environment:** A feedback system that legitimizes anticipatory work, evaluates current policies for future readiness, stress-tests them, and facilitates dialogue with citizens about desired futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

## Why Foresight is Critical for Policymaking

### Addressing "Super Wicked Problems"

European administrations face increasingly complex policy issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The world is grappling with "super wicked problems" such as [[Role of Foresight in Addressing Climate Change and Biodiversity | climate change]] and "black swan events" like COVID-19, compounded by complex multi-level governance structures and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Complexity can be managed through the right decision-making and cooperative systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Building Resilience and Trust

A primary challenge for public administrations is building resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. This resilience stems from a combination of stable, efficient processes that deliver quality services and policies, alongside a capacity for disruption to challenge, innovate, adapt, and improve public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Anticipatory innovation capacity and the courage to challenge the status quo are vital for democratic societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Moreover, research shows a direct link between citizens' trust in government and its ability to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:26">[01:19:26]</a>. Proactive anticipation builds trust and resilience within both government and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>.

### Shifting Towards Proactive Governance

[[Strategic foresight and innovation in government | Governments need to shift from reactive to proactive governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This involves:

*   **Continuous Improvement:** Governments should continuously improve their capacity to anticipate and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Planning:** Creating long-term planning for short-term democracies through revised policy-making and budgetary processes, and improved dialogue between politicians and public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.
*   **Integrating Foresight:** Ensuring that [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] and innovation are not just extra layers but core operating systems for public sector effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>.

## Case Study: Finland's Approach to Anticipatory Innovation Governance

Finland is undergoing one of its largest public sector transformations, including the creation of welfare counties, a new level of public governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Finland intends to take concrete steps to shift towards proactive governance, with initial steps planned for the next government term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The OECD has collaborated with Finland to develop and assess an [[anticipatory_innovation_and_strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG) model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Key Areas for AIG Integration in Finland:

The AIG functions need to be integrated into existing government functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:01">[02:07:01]</a>:

*   **Strategy Planning:** Infusing anticipatory innovation into how government strategies are planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:18">[02:17:18]</a>.
*   **Budgetary Decisions:** Incorporating anticipatory knowledge into budget and investment processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:50">[02:14:50]</a>.
*   **Legislation:** Adapting legal acts to be future-ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>.
*   **Human Resources:** Promoting skills and capacities related to future thinking and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:31">[02:27:31]</a>.
*   **Government Transition Function:** Ensuring continuity of long-term reforms and knowledge transfer across government terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:06">[02:54:06]</a>.
*   **Emerging Issues Analysis:** Making government planning functions more transparent in analyzing and assigning responsibility for new emerging topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:19">[02:28:19]</a>.

### Implementation and Recommendations:

The AIG model provides a framework to assess anticipatory capacity in governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:57">[02:22:57]</a>. Despite Finland's advanced governance system, there remains work to be done to integrate [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] more effectively into policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:14">[02:24:14]</a>. Specific action points include:

*   Systemizing transition processes to improve continuity of long-term reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:04">[02:29:04]</a>.
*   Developing methods to plan responses to emerging issues, assigning responsibility and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   Establishing structures for regular collective sense-making, visioning, and exploration of alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:19">[02:29:19]</a>.
*   Testing new approaches for allocating resources to emerging phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:26">[02:29:26]</a>.
*   Integrating future-oriented data into fiscal planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:07">[02:37:07]</a>.
*   Designing training and roles to make anticipation a reality for civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:03">[03:00:03]</a>.
*   Institutionalizing dialogue and deliberation with citizens to build trust on uncertain topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:08">[03:10:08]</a>.
*   Connecting [[Foresight and Scenario Planning | Futures and Foresight Systems]] to the policymaking system to ensure a value chain of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   Tracking and assessing the use of anticipatory approaches to understand what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

Finland considers this a marathon, not a sprint, aiming for readiness by the end of the 2020s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. The Ministry of Finance plays a key coordinating role in implementing these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## International Relevance and Collaboration

The European Commission actively supports member states in adopting [[anticipatory_innovation_and_strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | anticipatory innovation governance]] through financial support, technical assistance, and intellectual advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The Finnish example serves as a blueprint for other member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### Challenges Faced by EU Member States:

*   **Technological Change:** The unprecedented speed of technological change requires adapting administrative work and decision-making methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Demographic Shifts & Skill Shortages:** New skills are needed to address demographic challenges and skill shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **Managing Policy Complexity:** Encouraging a culture of innovation as a central part of public administration's functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Green Transition:** Administrations need leadership, competence, and a sound knowledge base to achieve climate neutrality goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Competition for Limited Public Funding:** Prioritization, leadership, and innovative thinking are crucial for improved financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

### Examples from Other Countries:

*   **Netherlands:** Recognizes the fit for the AIG model due to its open nature and broad policy discussions, but lacks a structured approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Challenges include translating innovation into policy and overcoming public servants' risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Long-term funding for infrastructure projects helps keep topics on the agenda, but new or innovative issues struggle for sustained funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Norway:** Sees similarities with Finland and aims to strengthen a "Nordic model" of anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Uses [[Foresight and Scenario Planning | scenario planning]], Horizon scanning, and other foresight methods for robust policies and future-fit public services. Examples include:
    *   Assessing information influence on elections with five scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
    *   Developing public sector scenarios for 2040 for innovation policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
    *   Using foresight in "live events" (seamless services program) to meet future user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
    *   Focuses on making anticipatory methods available and encouraging experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>.
*   **Portugal:** Despite geographical distance, faces similar challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. A new central government institution, PlanAPP, coordinates planning, foresight, monitoring of public policy, and policy evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Initiatives include an anticipatory innovation starter kit and the "Ministries of the Future" initiative during its EU presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. Aims to build a culture that promotes and integrates foresight and innovation across the public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>. Also works on citizen participation through projects like the "2050 lab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

## Conclusion

The role of foresight in policymaking is not a "nice to have" but a critical component for integrated governments to effectively work and deliver in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a>. This ongoing work, pioneered by countries like Finland with the support of the OECD and European Commission, aims to provide a blueprint for other nations to become more future-ready and resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:39">[01:28:39]</a>.

Governments engage in [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] for various reasons, sometimes with precise objectives and other times for broader exploration; both approaches are considered beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Driving Factors for Innovation

### Addressing Specific Challenges
One clear reason for [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] is to address specific, known challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For example, solving issues like ocean cleanup or homelessness requires targeted [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This approach provides clear direction and is legitimate because the problem itself justifies the need for [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Fostering Exploration and Creativity
Another significant reason for [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] in government is to allow for exploration and creativity, empowering individuals to discover new things and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The nature of [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] is that it is new and uncertain, making it impossible to predict the origin of the "next big thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Therefore, allowing people to explore new ideas is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

In the private sector, this concept is known as "entrepreneurial discovering," where the most transformative ideas often emerge from individuals given the freedom to experiment and explore new ways of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Historically, innovations like the combustion engine stemmed from such exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This principle should also be applied in the [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | public sector]], as government services and products constantly require revamping and transformation to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Developing the Capacity to Innovate
A third reason for civil servants and [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | public sectors]] to innovate is to develop the inherent ability to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Innovation is not an innate trait; it is learned through experienceâ€”"learning by doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Governments need to grant a certain "license to explore," experiment with new ideas, and apply them in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This ensures that when significant challenges arise, there are individuals with the capacity to develop projects and solve problems in novel ways because they have prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

This trend is observable in contemporary governments:
*   **Finland** has a new experimentation program at the central government level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Canada** has an "experimentation directive" that allows different government departments to test various policy ideas on a smaller scale before widespread application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Staying Competitive and Relevant
Finally, governments sometimes innovate to avoid being left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Just as companies in the private sector like Apple or Sony continuously explore new options and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, governments may innovate because their peers or neighbors are doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Unexplored options can represent a cost, and it's essential to explore various possibilities to remain viable when a particular option becomes critical in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

All these reasons are valid drivers for [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] in government, although the specific activities involved may necessitate different methods and [[Innovation Strategies for Governments | strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

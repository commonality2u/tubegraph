[[mission_oriented_innovation | Mission oriented innovation]] aims to direct economic growth towards more equitable and green outcomes, providing a new policy framework and reorganizing policymaking to address grand challenges effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. This approach gained significant focus in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as governments recognized their power to direct economic growth and shape economies towards desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

Instead of merely reacting to market failures or private sector initiatives, governments can proactively shape future markets, take risks, and adopt a long-term view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. [[mission_oriented_innovation | Missions]] help governments work across silos and collaborate with the private sector towards common goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

## Core Principles and Criteria

The European Commission's approach to [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]], heavily influenced by Mariana Mazzucato, highlights five key criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>:

1.  **Inspirational and Directional** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>: Missions should be easily understandable and motivating for wider audiences and citizens, moving beyond abstract percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.
2.  **Clear and Targeted** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>: While inspirational, they also need specific, measurable targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.
3.  **Include Research and Innovation Investment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>: Missions should drive investment in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.
4.  **Cross-sectoral and Cross-disciplinary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>: Missions must involve various sectors (e.g., energy, food) and disciplines (e.g., technology, behavioral aspects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. An ambitious mission is often uncomfortable enough for many people initially because it requires cross-sectoral thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.
5.  **Enable Multiple Solutions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>: Governments enable the space for solutions to be found by multiple actors (private sector, universities, NGOs), rather than dictating a single solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.

### The ROAR Framework

The ROAR framework provides a policy structure for [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]], encompassing four key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>:

*   **Directionality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>: Defining a specific direction for economic growth and policies, contextualizing broader challenges like Sustainable Development Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.
*   **Organizational Capabilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>: Building public organizations capable of moving beyond traditional grant-giving to become more innovative themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.
*   **Assessment and Evaluation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>: Developing new methodologies to evaluate complex initiatives that create new markets, not just simple cost-benefit analyses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>.
*   **Risks and Rewards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>: Addressing who invests and who benefits from the outcomes, especially crucial in areas like vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

## Operationalizing [[mission_oriented_innovation | Missions]]

Making [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] operational and accessible to civil servants is a key interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>. This includes using methods like the "mission planning canvas" to prepare and set missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

The [[Innovation strategies | Innovation facets model]] helps governments understand different types of innovation that can support missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>:

*   **Anticipatory Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>: Identifying new and upcoming challenges through futures or foresight outlooks to inform high-level goals and missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>: Improving current systems to meet the demands of mission goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>: Creating space for bottom-up, grassroots innovations that can support the overall mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.

## [[Mission oriented innovation challenges and implementation | Challenges and Implementation]]

The growing role of [[mission_oriented_innovation | Mission oriented innovation]] policies in member countries comes with [[mission_oriented_innovation challenges and implementation | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>:

*   **Defining Missions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>: Missions become more specific over time, but there's a need to avoid "mission washing" â€“ simply redefining old policies as missions without fundamental change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>.
*   **Governance Redesign** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>: [[mission_oriented_innovation | Missions]] require redesigning governance for cross-policy and cross-ministerial approaches to tackle complex problems that span traditional boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:34:00">[22:34:00]</a>.
*   **Diversity of Practice** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>: [[mission_oriented_innovation | Mission practices]] vary widely, from politically driven initiatives (e.g., European Commission) to bottom-up approaches (e.g., Vinnova in Sweden) or those led by third-sector organizations (e.g., Royal Engineering Society) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>.
*   **Differing Perspectives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>: Different actors within the [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission]] ecosystem (e.g., ministries, agencies, private sector) will perceive and approach the [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission]] differently, requiring coordination and tailored motivation strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:41:00">[42:41:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Resistance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>: Overcoming resistance within public organizations often involves demonstrating successful examples, introducing new tools like strategic design, or fostering engagement with civil society to generate a dynamic for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. Resistance often stems from rational reasons, such as fear of punishment for ambitious goals without adequate resources, highlighting the need for support structures for experimentation and tolerance for trial and error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>.
*   **Capacity Imbalances** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>: [[mission_oriented_innovation | Mission-oriented change]] can lead to significant staff turnover as people may not be able or willing to adapt to new ways of working, necessitating continuous capacity building and planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>.

## Examples of [[mission_oriented_innovation | Mission-Oriented Innovation]] in Practice

### Sweden (Vinnova)

Vinnova, the Swedish innovation agency, adopted a bottom-up approach to [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]], engaging citizens in workshops to define areas like healthy and sustainable food and sustainable mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>.

*   **Sustainable Food** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:38:00">[24:38:00]</a>: Recognizing food as a major carbon producer, Vinnova explored how to decarbonize food habits. For example, by stipulating that all publicly funded school lunches in Sweden must be sustainable, the government creates a massive task for various agencies and funding bodies to rethink operations and supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:58:00">[25:58:00]</a>. This also resonates easily with citizens who want healthy school lunches for their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.
*   **Livable Streets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[00:27:10]</a>: The mission focused on making every street livable, reducing cars, and fostering more life, businesses, and interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20:00">[28:20:00]</a>.
*   **Engagement and Prototyping** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>: Vinnova engaged diverse groups, from school children to the prime minister, in collaborative design workshops. They implemented quick prototypes to demonstrate the impact of changing street environments, such as promoting cycling and creating spaces for social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35:00">[27:35:00]</a>.

This approach demonstrates how [[innovation strategies | innovation agencies]] can become more active in coordinating across ministries and engaging citizens, fostering bottom-up innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>.

### Spain (National Innovation Agency - CDTI)

Spain's national innovation agency (CDTI) aims to coordinate various ministries and agencies around common goals, such as increasing sustainable mobility while reducing overall aggregate mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>. The goal is to create more compact cities with lower carbon footprints without diminishing the quality of life or access to services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>. This demonstrates how [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] can galvanize efforts around important goals and frame them in a way that resonates with public organizations and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:54:00">[30:54:00]</a>. Germany also uses [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] to coordinate ministries at federal and state levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>.

### Netherlands (Health Holland)

Health Holland's [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission]] is for all Dutch citizens to live at least five years longer in good health by 2040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a>. This complex [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission]] is broken down into sub-goals and requires a participatory experimental process across different domains (e.g., dementia, chronic conditions, lifestyle, social care) and regional contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:00">[35:11:00]</a>.

Key takeaways from Health Holland:

*   **Beyond Simple Challenges** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:48:00">[34:48:00]</a>: Complex issues like changing human behavior cannot be solved with simple hackathons or static trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>.
*   **Ongoing and Adaptive** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:00">[35:37:00]</a>: [[mission_oriented_innovation | Missions]] are ongoing; experiments may not always work, requiring the ability to reframe actions and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:39:00">[35:39:00]</a>.
*   **Systems Approach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:00">[35:52:00]</a>: Understanding the system landscapes and niches of different activities is crucial to gain commitment from various organizations and communities at multiple levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:55:00">[35:55:00]</a>.
*   **Legitimacy and Mandate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:00">[36:12:00]</a>: A critical question for agencies or sectoral ministries is how to gain the mandate and legitimacy to lead collaborative networks beyond their single organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:16:00">[36:16:00]</a>. If a problem is big enough, organizations should pursue it as a [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission]], even if levers are outside their direct control, by building relationships and lobbying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>.

### Royal Academy of Engineering (UK)

The Royal Academy of Engineering works with engineers, academics, and business leaders on complex [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:10:00">[37:10:00]</a>. A key lesson is **not to overcommit upfront** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:24:00">[37:24:00]</a>. Instead, develop action plans and operational plans for [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] with a flexible, dynamic approach, exploring what's possible and understanding existing system capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:27:00">[37:27:00]</a>.

*   **Inclusivity and Networks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a>: Be extremely inclusive, building a "community of the willing," listening to underrepresented voices, and leveraging networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:19:00">[38:19:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Lock-in** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:30:00">[38:30:00]</a>: A danger is the lock-in effect, where engaging only with core teams misses key action points or diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:00">[38:32:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways from Discussions

[[mission_oriented_innovation | Missions]] demonstrate the need to change existing policy frameworks, as old approaches will not yield different outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:56:00">[39:56:00]</a>. The current stage involves trying diverse experimental approaches and learning from emerging practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:12:00">[40:12:00]</a>.

### How do [[mission_oriented_innovation | Mission-Oriented Policies]] Differ from Existing Policies?

Traditional government policies often focus on short-term goals (e.g., 3-4 year political cycles) and operate in silos, with each department or ministry pursuing its own objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:46:00">[47:46:00]</a>. [[mission_oriented_innovation | Missions]] offer a reframing: recognizing that many problems (like climate change) are cross-cutting and require a long-term, collaborative roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:10:00">[48:10:00]</a>.

Current government structures are often the result of previous, often unconscious, [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] (e.g., post-WWII reconstruction, supporting the nuclear family) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:57:00">[48:57:00]</a>. Consciously setting [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] now is vital because society is undergoing a paradigmatic shift into a digital age, facing vastly different problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:26:00">[49:26:00]</a>. [[mission_oriented_innovation | Missions]] are a powerful tool for building new types of government structures aligned with 21st-century goals and societal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:51:00">[49:51:00]</a>.

### Setting Missions: Policy-Specific vs. Overall Strategy

[[mission_oriented_innovation | Missions]] can be both policy-specific and part of an overall policy strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:49:00">[50:49:00]</a>. Mega-missions like climate change have become universal for many governments, but their operationalization depends on specific contexts (e.g., through transportation, public sector carbon neutrality) and requires political will and existing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:00">[51:13:00]</a>. National-level [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] often emerge from government action plans and programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:09:00">[52:09:00]</a>.

### Role of Civil Society

Civil society organizations (CSOs) are crucial for driving [[mission_oriented_innovation | Mission oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:34:00">[53:34:00]</a>. Their engagement is essential for long-term commitment that extends beyond political cycles, ensuring broad societal support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:00:00">[54:00:00]</a>. Strong democracies with robust CSOs tend to see [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] become highly relevant (e.g., Sweden, Denmark) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:34:00">[54:34:00]</a>. True engagement, rather than just sharing plans, ensures that ambitious policy goals are widely known and supported by the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:08:00">[57:08:00]</a>.

### Designing Brave Yet Achievable Missions

The challenge is to design [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] that are brave and ambitious but also achievable and realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This requires strong analytical and engagement tools, diverse perspectives, and contextual design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>. A good [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission]] often feels uncomfortable initially because it demands cross-sectoral collaboration and challenges existing ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>. While high ambition is good, it must be paired with realistic implementation plans that consider existing capabilities and capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>. [[mission_oriented_innovation | Mission-oriented approaches]] should be continuous and evolving, integrating capacity and capability programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.

### Role of Anticipatory Regulation

Anticipatory regulation is vital for setting [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] and gaining stakeholder commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. Regulatory frameworks should allow for experimentation, trials, and flexible formatting, particularly for dynamic [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] that may involve complex issues like core human rights or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>. Regulators themselves need to be agile and anticipatory, ready to adapt or clarify rules to avoid becoming roadblocks to [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission]] fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.

Climate councils play a vital advisory role in guiding governments and parliaments on climate policies around the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:06">[02:27:06]</a>. These bodies are often established to look into climate science and provide evidence-based advice to government officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:41">[02:37:41]</a>. The International Climate Council's Network (ICCN) comprises various climate councils worldwide, sharing a common interest in strengthening [[challenges_and_solutions_in_climate_policy_governance | climate governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:40">[10:01:40]</a>.

## Core Functions and Mandates

Climate councils serve several key functions to support [[addressing_climate_change | climate action]]:
*   **Scientific Advisory** Their primary role involves analyzing climate science to inform policy recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:27">[02:41:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:59">[10:09:59]</a>. This function bridges the gap between scientific findings and policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:20">[11:36:20]</a>.
*   **Assessment of Progress** Councils provide assessments of progress against climate targets and offer forward-looking advice on how to stay on track for long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.
*   **Policy Advice** They advise on policies and sectoral pathways for [[addressing_climate_change | climate mitigation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>.
*   **Democratic Accountability** Some suggest that embedding provisions to update climate framework laws, including stipulating periodic reviews, can improve mandates and functioning from a democratic perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>.

## Challenges in Policy Implementation

Despite their crucial role, climate councils and climate policy implementation face significant challenges:
*   **Politicization of Climate Change** Climate change is increasingly becoming a politicized issue, often painted as a left-wing agenda rather than being based on scientific evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:15">[10:14:15]</a>. This trend makes [[addressing_climate_change | decarbonization]] harder globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:04">[10:27:04]</a>.
*   **Short Time Horizons of Government** Due to short election cycles, policies can "flip-flop" every four to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>, undermining long-term [[challenges_and_solutions_in_climate_policy_governance | climate action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:10">[12:35:10]</a>. Climate councils aim to mitigate this by ensuring policy consistency across long time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.
*   **Weak Governance** Inadequate channels in government often mean that climate policy is not consistently informed by science or does not adequately involve the public and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.
*   **Hard-to-Abate Sectors** Significant progress has been made in decarbonizing power sectors, but harder-to-abate sectors like agriculture and food still lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Councils highlight a large disconnect between action in these sectors and the potential emissions reductions indicated by the IPCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
*   **Implementation Hurdles** Even with high-level support, bureaucratic inefficiencies can slow down implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. Political and institutional barriers, particularly in politically contested areas like energy, also pose difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.

## Leveraging [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | Mission Governance]] for Effectiveness

[[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | Mission governance]] can significantly strengthen the role of climate councils and overall [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_green_governance | green governance]]:
*   **Anchoring in Government** Effective [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | mission governance]] requires strong anchoring, ideally at the center of government within a central ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This ensures high-level political support and unified direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sectoral Coordination** [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | Mission-oriented approaches]] help integrate climate action across core government ministries and align with national development strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. This addresses the challenge of climate policy being perceived as the sole responsibility of "climate people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Building Trust** By anchoring policies around [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | mission governance]] and leaning on their impartial, evidence-based credibility, climate councils can help build trust in institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Fostering Societal Engagement** Climate councils can play a key role in spurring societal engagement and support for climate action by facilitating dialogue mechanisms and using citizen councils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>.

### Examples of Climate Councils in Practice
*   **United Kingdom** The UK has embedded [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | mission governance]] at the center of government through a dedicated cabinet committee on climate change chaired by the Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The UK Climate Change Committee advises on targets, pathways, and progress, contributing to the "net zero mission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **South Africa** The Presidential Climate Change Commission is chaired by the President, allowing for a systematic and cross-sectoral approach to climate challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. This central anchoring helps overcome the perception that climate policy is solely an environmental initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. They have undertaken in-depth consultation processes with various stakeholders, including youth, local government, faith-based sectors, and workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>.
*   **New Zealand** The New Zealand Climate Change Commission has prioritized improving stakeholder engagement, emphasizing the importance of broader societal contributions to achieving net zero emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>.
*   **Chile** Chile's regional climate change council specifically focuses on vertical coordination of targets and instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.
*   **Denmark** Denmark's "inomissions" explicitly integrate experimentation within mission portfolios, continuously refining policies based on evidence and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. The Innovation Fund Denmark, as the main investor for four Danish green mission partnerships, focuses on research and [[innovation_and_technology_in_climate_mitigation | innovation in climate mitigation]] within specific areas like carbon capture, green fuels, and circular economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>.
*   **Ireland** The Climate Change Advisory Council in Ireland emphasizes clear objectives and strong, visible leadership from political and administrative ministries for effective climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>.

## Future Role and Opportunities

Climate councils are pivotal in promoting a mission-oriented approach, which establishes clear, measurable, and time-bound objectives for climate commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. This approach ensures that climate mitigation and adaptation are prioritized at the highest institutional levels, guiding resource allocation and strengthening cross-sectoral coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

While councils primarily act as expert advisors rather than policymakers or implementers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, their role can be enhanced by:
*   **Systematic Integration** Integrating [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | mission governance]] principles into national climate efforts systematically and concretely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.
*   **Targeted Missions** Developing targeted missions to address specific sub-targets within broader climate goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement** Focusing on continuous learning, experimentation, and adaptation in policy development and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.
*   **Cross-Learning** Leveraging the comprehensive analysis provided by reports on climate governance frameworks across different countries to foster cross-learning and tailored support to members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

The **Mission Action Lab** is an initiative supporting the implementation of missions by gathering mission managers to share practical examples and address real-life challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This collaborative approach, along with stronger partnerships between organizations like the OECD and the International Climate Council's Network, aims to keep [[challenges_in_addressing_climate_change | climate change]] at the forefront of the political agenda and drive long-term, effective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

Innovation generally refers to new things or novelty that did not exist before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While the concept of innovation is well-understood in the private sector, it becomes more complicated when applied to the public sector due to the absence of a market feedback system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Private Sector Innovation

In the private sector, innovation is defined as something new that is implemented within a market context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The primary goal of private sector innovation is for a firm to gain a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This can manifest as a new service, process, product, or any other form of new thinking applied to achieve a direct market proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Public Sector Innovation

[[public_sector_innovation | Public sector innovation]] is also centered on novelty and newness, but specifically "new to the context" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For something to be considered [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]], it must be implemented; it's not merely an invention or an idea that has been discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It must be applied new thinking, services, or processes that have had actual impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Purpose and Impact

Unlike the private sector, [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] cannot aim for competitive advantage because the government is typically the sole player in its domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Instead, the focus is on contributing to a change in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> and bringing some form of value to the population that uses the innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

A crucial distinction is that the impact of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] can be both positive and negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For example, digital advancements might offer quicker services to many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, but simultaneously exclude parts of the population lacking access to digital tools or the capability to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

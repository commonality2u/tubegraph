The City of Vienna serves as a practical example of [[innovation_in_public_administration | public sector innovation]], particularly in enhancement-oriented [[innovation_in_public_sector_management | innovation]]. Their long-term development is centered on improving public services to increase public value, focusing on gradual, incremental improvements rather than disruptive changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Focus on Quality of Life and Citizen Closeness

The development of Vienna's administration dates back over 2000 years, consistently addressing the challenge of providing an affordable quality of life in a big city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The city prides itself on being close to its citizens, considering this a key factor for its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. Vienna is one of Europe's fastest-growing cities, soon to reach 2 million inhabitants, which is seen as a proof of its high quality levels in various aspects like governance, quality of living, modernization, and smart city indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>.

The concept of quality of living in Vienna is approached holistically, encompassing:
*   Housing, with a 100-year tradition of municipal housing providing affordable options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>.
*   Social and health services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>.
*   Environmental aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.
*   Science, economy, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>.

This comprehensive approach is described as "equality of governments for quality of living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.

## Administrative Evolution and Citizen Participation

Vienna has a long-standing tradition of "one-stop shops" for public services, with municipal district offices bringing administration very close to citizens, similar to smaller villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>.

The city's administration has evolved from a classic model focused on providing services and maintaining order to a role of facilitator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. This means looking at needs and opportunities and developing the city's future together with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:37">[01:17:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>. This shift required a change of mindset within the administration itself, starting "within the heads" of all public sector actors, and then extending to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. Citizens were receptive, having good ideas and interest in the city's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. This mutual starting point fostered a partnership that allowed for gradual transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>.

Key aspects of this transformative [[collaboration_and_innovation_in_public_sector | collaboration and innovation]] include:
*   Organizational and societal culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>.
*   Open and active communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>.
*   Transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:24">[01:23:24]</a>.
*   Utmost [[public_participation_and_trust_in_urban_governance | participation]] within the administration, with citizens, and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:29">[01:23:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:34">[01:23:34]</a>.
*   Exchange of expectations and testing feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:40">[01:23:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>.

This approach proved beneficial even during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well-known features like virtual government websites and modern communication tools (e.g., the Vienna bot) provided timely information and guidance to citizens and staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:13">[01:21:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>.

The administration also focuses on:
*   Impact orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>.
*   Customer orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.
*   Agreement between political and administrative levels, using a systematic agreement system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:12">[01:24:12]</a>.

## Common Assessment Framework (CAF)

A core tool for quality management in Vienna is the Common Assessment Framework (CAF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:35">[01:24:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>. Designed by EU public administration experts, CAF specifically supports [[feedback_and_improvements_in_public_administration_using_caf | enhancement-oriented innovation in public administration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:54">[01:24:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>. Although 20 years old, it remains relevant due to its continuous evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>.

CAF provides guidance for modern public administration and cultural change through features such as:
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Utilizing the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:49">[01:25:49]</a>.
*   **Learning Organization:** A central goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>.
*   **Self-Assessment:** Relying on internal expertise and building bridges with partners, citizens, and other public administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **Excellence Principles and UN Sustainable Development Goals:** Linking to broader global and European development directions while remaining adaptable to local strategies and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>.

CAF is designed to be easy to handle, applicable to any department, organization, or topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>.

## Impact and Future Outlook

The application of these quality management practices has shown impact through gained expertise and self-development within the administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:12">[01:27:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:23">[01:27:23]</a>. This has enabled the city to achieve its goal of becoming a facilitator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:39">[01:27:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:43">[01:27:43]</a>.

A prime example of this impact is [[urban_policy_and_sustainable_development | Smart City Vienna]], which focuses on continuous development for all citizens, addressing environmental, economic, and technical aspects, and aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:12">[01:28:12]</a>. Information is provided to citizens on how to join and support these efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>.

The City of Vienna's experience demonstrates how a strategic focus on [[integration_of_quality_and_innovation_in_public_sector_governance | quality and innovation]] transforms public administration into a reliable and capable partner, interested in citizens' needs and necessary steps for the common good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:58">[01:28:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>.

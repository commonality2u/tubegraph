The "Government Aftershock" initiative was launched as a global enterprise involving over 65 events worldwide, unified by three core questions: what to leave behind, what to keep, and what to do differently given recent learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This initiative engaged over 5,500 participants globally, including ministers, heads of state, and experienced practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Its primary aim was to tap into, expose, share, and connect groups for collective learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. The OECD facilitated this as a convener and aggregator of diverse insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Key Insights from Government Aftershock Events

The discussions revealed significant themes regarding how governments operated during the COVID-19 pandemic and what changes should be sustained.

### Embracing Complexity and Experimentation
The Center for Public Impact (CPI), a not-for-profit foundation, highlighted that their emerging vision for a reimagined government embraces complexity, relationship building, and [[experimentation_in_government_innovation | experimentation for learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The pandemic forced an [[experimentation_in_government_innovation | experimental mindset]] across government, raising the question of whether this mindset can be continued more broadly once the crisis fades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Sustaining Positive Changes
Participants identified several practices that should be continued:
*   **Collective Learning and Collaboration:** Initiatives like "Government Aftershock" itself were seen as vital for creating a community for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. There was significant [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | cross-sectoral collaboration]] and breakdown of silos within and across governments, leading to more joined-up thinking and collective learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Shortened Feedback Loops:** Frontline services experienced welcome shortened feedback loops with central government, enabling real-time feedback and reduced bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### What to Leave Behind
Key areas identified for cessation include:
*   **Short-term Thinking:** The crisis offered an opportunity to think bigger picture and break the cycle of short-term solutions driven by political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Rigid Ways of Working and Siloed Thinking:** Failures of public sector agencies were attributed to rigid practices, the assumption that government has all the answers, and processes not conducive to systems thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Misha Core of the Australian Taxation Office called for a "process of unlearning" to let go of historical assumptions and mental models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

### What to Start Doing
New approaches identified as crucial for the future include:
*   **Building Relationships in Unexpected Ways:** Significant [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | cross-sectoral]] and cross-silo interactions occurred, with emphasis on the "art of listening" and the importance of vulnerability for building trusting relationships between government and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Focus on Inclusive Recovery:** The pandemic and movements like Black Lives Matter created an opportunity to reimagine who the economy is built for and how it's structured, focusing on an inclusive recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Overarching Themes and Challenges
The crisis demonstrated government's capacity for [[innovation in government | innovation]], agility, and rapid adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. However, the challenge is to sustain these working methods beyond individual effort and embed them into the entire system and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

### Digital Transformation and Data Use
Governments and society digitized overnight out of necessity, implementing changes in days that would normally take years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. Key considerations include:
*   **Human-Centric Regulations:** As government moves into a more digital world, human-centric regulations must accompany digitization, ensuring data privacy, transparency, and digital rights are central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
*   **Purposeful Digitization:** Digitization should not merely transpose physical processes online, but rather critically reflect on and reform existing approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **High-Frequency and Disaggregated Data:** Governments need skills to manage high-frequency, disaggregated, and diverse data to effectively respond to complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

### Enhanced Collaboration
The crisis fostered collaboration across different levels of government, country borders, and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>.
*   **Local Government Strengths:** Local governments, being directly connected to citizens, showed strong networks and responsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.
*   [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | **Cross-Sector Collaboration**]]: Increased use of hackathons and challenge-based procurement demonstrated flexibility, posing the question of how to sustain this beyond crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.
*   [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | **International Collaboration**]]: 72% of participants felt it was more important for national governments to work with each other, recognizing that modern challenges transcend borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

### Trust and Transparency
Trust was identified as the difference between success and unsuccess of measures during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.
*   **Human-Centered Communication:** Governments adopted more human-centered communication strategies, deliberately targeting communities often overlooked, leading to increased trust through openness about uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.
*   **Participatory Processes:** Including everyone in decision-making processes improves attitudes and compliance, and governments being open about not having all the answers built trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

### Policy Priorities and Inclusion
The year highlighted gaps in welfare policies and brought issues like gender-based violence and systemic racism to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. This presents an opportunity to invest in more inclusive and sustainable economies, infrastructure, and societies, focusing on human elements, social connection, and community building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

### Futures and Uncertainty
The complex challenges faced necessitate probing into the future and trying out different approaches to steer towards preferred futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. New methods beyond pure risk aversion, such as anticipation and futurist thinking, systems approaches, and agile/adaptive working methods, gained significant traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.

## Challenges to Preconceptions

*   **Humanity of Public Servants:** There was a demystification of public servants as "superheroes" who can handle everything, revealing the need for empathy and support within government workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.
*   **Central Government Appetite for Change:** A significant challenge is understanding the appetite of central government for adopting new practices, as much of the emerging [[innovation in government | innovation]] and information sharing was observed at the local government or charity level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.

## The Call to Action: Making Change Sustainable

Despite the willingness to learn from the crisis, a significant concern is that governments might be less willing to take concrete action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. The core question becomes: what will make this crisis different from previous ones, ensuring that the lessons learned are embedded and the "gravitational pull" back to unsatisfactory default settings is overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>?

The initiative aims to outline a "provocation for governments and all of us" to define what everyone will do differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>. This requires collective effort, as change cannot be sustained by governments alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. This "collective learning prototype" demonstrates a different way of collective sense-making to drive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.

A call to action should provide:
*   Actionable guidance for increasing [[experimentation_in_government_innovation | experimentation]] and a values-led approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.
*   Guidance on futures thinking best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>.
*   Inspiration to promote what is possible in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   A multi-disciplinary approach to improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

This initiative provides insights to inform those determining the future state of government, marking a "pivot point" for generational change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.

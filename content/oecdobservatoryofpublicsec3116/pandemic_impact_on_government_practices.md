The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reshaped the landscape of public governance, prompting governments worldwide to confront new realities and accelerate transformative changes. A round table discussion, "Government After Shock," focused on what the pandemic revealed about government practices and priorities for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Key Discoveries and Lessons Learned

The crisis served as a critical test for many government policies, revealing what worked and what didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Impact of COVID-19 on Government and Citizen Relations

Trust is fundamental to governance models and democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. The pandemic demonstrated that effective, speedy decisions during a crisis are impossible without public trust and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

*   **Communication is Key**: Mass communication campaigns were vital to keep citizens informed and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. Transparency, honesty, and educating the public with specialists' input helped foster confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>.
*   **Citizen Participation**: Involving citizens in discussions about socially acceptable measures and digital tools, and providing feedback mechanisms, contributed to a participatory approach to decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.
*   **Higher Expectations**: Citizens now have higher expectations for communication, proactive actions, and transparency from their governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.

## Sustainability and Future Strategies

Many of the changes implemented during the pandemic are likely to be sustainable and have set new standards for public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>.

*   **New Norms**: Remote working practices will likely combine with office work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>. Online parliamentary sessions and meetings, once deemed impossible, are now a sustainable practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Digital Transformation**: Governments are committed to further digital transformation, aiming for human-centered public services and ethical use of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.
*   **Strategic Planning**: New strategies, such as "Digital Slovenia and Digital Public Administration 2021-2027," are being prepared to address agility and stability in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. Portugal's "Strategy for Innovation and Modernization of the State and Public Administration" also emphasizes resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.

## Interconnectedness and Complexity

The crisis starkly showcased the interconnectedness of issues (health, social, economic) and global interdependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.

*   **Whole-of-Government Approach**: Governments recognized the need for a comprehensive and holistic approach to policy-making, embracing a "whole of government" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.
*   **Inter-sectoral Adaptations**: Sectors like tourism and real estate had to adapt to new realities, promoting internal tourism and finding new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.
*   **Global Cooperation**: The breaking of logistical chains and closing of borders highlighted the crucial role of international cooperation. Initiatives like the African Medical Supplies Portal emerged as a continental marketplace for critical medical supplies, also testing the African Free Trade Agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.
*   **Future Focus**: Future policymaking must systematically address challenges, focusing on core problems rather than just symptoms, and recognizing that "one system cannot solve challenges in isolation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:21">[01:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>.

## [[Lessons learned from the COVID19 pandemic for future governance strategies | Lessons Learned]]: A Call for Renovation

The pandemic presents a significant opportunity for the renovation of democracy, policymaking, and service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The three key words of change for public governance systems:
> *   **Consolidation** (of efforts, government, and public) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>
> *   **Efficiency** (of government) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>
> *   **Innovation** (in methods and thinking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>

Moving forward, governments are committed to:

*   **Human-centered digital transformation**: Focusing on people, driven by their choices, and using technology ethically and responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>.
*   **Empowerment of civil servants**: Encouraging self-organization, efficiency, and result-driven work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. This includes continuous education, attracting and retaining talent, and fostering cooperation between experienced and young civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.
*   **Investment in technology, research, and innovation**: To develop policies capable of detecting early warning signs of future pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.
*   **Maintaining motivation in the "new normal"**: A new challenge for public administration is inspiring and keeping civil servants motivated, efficient, and happy in a remote work environment, especially as pandemic waves continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>.

The crisis has shown that public administration can operate in new ways, setting much higher standards and expectations for its relationship with citizens and non-governmental organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:58">[01:48:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

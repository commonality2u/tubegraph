[[Innovation in public administration | Innovation in public administration]] is a crucial topic, particularly when relying on case studies, reality studies, and projects submitted for awards like the European Public Sector Award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It is important to reflect on how to implement [[innovation in the public sector | innovation in the public sector]], why it is important, what the [[Challenges in implementing innovation in the public sector | challenges are]], and how to overcome them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Perceived Challenges to Innovation
Public administrations are often perceived, both internally and externally, as highly bureaucratic and hierarchical, making [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This perception includes a lack of a culture of questioning procedures and a fear of wasting public funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Many still view public sector organizations as rigid, hierarchical, and unable to question standard procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

However, it is true that public administrations can be both bureaucratic, hierarchical, and very innovative simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Challenges today demonstrate that [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] occurs daily when public servants and managers deal with complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Case Studies in Innovation

### LabX (Portugal)
LabX is an experimental project supported by the Portuguese government, started in 2017, to foster [[innovation in public sector management | innovation in public sector organizations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Its initial objectives included creating a network of innovators, designing new public services, and engaging citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. LabX was designed as an open and safe space to experiment and promote innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, focusing on citizens' and businesses' needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. It aimed to test solutions before implementation to learn from mistakes and reduce risks and costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Four years later, LabX is transitioning from an experimentation lab to an ambitious center for promoting [[innovation in public sector | innovation in the public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This evolution is natural given its growing role in Portuguese public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

#### Impact and Achievements
Since 2017, LabX has:
*   Carried out 25 experimental projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   Engaged over 10,000 citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   Involved more than 2,000 public servants and over 160 public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   Focused significantly on public service design to improve access to increasingly digital public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   Helped *Simplex*, Portugal's flagship program for administrative and regulatory simplification, include new projects that ease interactions between citizens/businesses and public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   Reduced administrative burdens and improved public service efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   Created a network of almost 700 innovators and a growing network of experimental labs with local governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

LabX has fostered a culture of experimentation and learning, demonstrating that testing and trying, even failing, is part of moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Micro-labs are emerging across public administration, and local governments are interested in their own experimentation labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

### GovBuys Innovation (Belgium)
This initiative, run by the NIDO innovation lab of the Belgian federal government, addresses challenges in public procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. The aim is to create an interactive marketplace for modern public procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. NIDO undertakes small-budget and open-market research, with experimentation at the initial stages to ensure efficient use of taxpayer money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

The project highlights the need for a shift in government spending to increase the value of tax money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. It addresses obstacles faced by civil servants and new innovative companies, as the public sector often works with the same large companies at high cost and slow pace, often without desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

GovBuys Innovation functions as a marketplace bringing together necessary parties, including public sector managers and staff, and innovative companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. It provides tools and expertise to work with innovative companies, guiding them to achieve the best results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. The initiative is not a new procurement platform but supports an agile process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.

The goal is for stakeholders to eventually use the platform autonomously, making NIDO less essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. The platform encourages transparency by revealing government challenges, while companies showcase solutions, inspiring civil servants with previously unknown possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.

### Partnership for Change (Slovenia)
This program, initiated in 2015, focuses on employee exchange and the transfer of good practices between the public and private sectors in Slovenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. It began spontaneously when the former minister was challenged by a youth think tank to open doors to understanding how things are done in both sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. The initial goal was to break stereotypes about the public sector being easy and the private sector being completely different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>.

The program offers a maximum five-day voluntary exchange based on employees' interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>. Over 300 employees have been exchanged between private and public sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. The process is kept simple and non-bureaucratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.

#### Added Value and Impact
*   **On-the-field training**: Employees learn practical project management in real environments, while private sector employees learn about strategy preparation, tenders, and e-service development in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.
*   **Breaking barriers and building trust**: Understanding each other's processes is a precondition for collaboration, leading to larger networks and easier future interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.
*   **Bottom-up cooperation**: The program organically grew from ministerial exchanges to include internal public sector exchanges and local level possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.
*   **Problem-solving**: It has led to solutions for various challenges, such as raising awareness for e-invoices in schools to save paper and administrative costs, designing e-taxes applications, and matching student skills to labor market needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>.

The program creates a safe way of experimenting without rigid obligations, spontaneously showing the path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>.

## Key Enablers and Principles for [[Role of innovation in public administration | Innovation in Public Administration]]

*   **Political Sponsorship**: Strong political support and personal commitment from government members are crucial for the success and sustainability of innovation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:47">[01:25:47]</a>.
*   **Culture of Experimentation and Learning from Failure**: Fostering experimentation shows that testing, trying, and sometimes failing is acceptable and leads to learning and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. The "right to challenge" policy in Portugal allows temporary removal of regulatory barriers to test new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>.
*   **Collaboration and Openness**:
    *   Making people realize that [[innovation in public sector | innovation]] is everyone's responsibility is key to successful implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>.
    *   Opening organizations to interaction with citizens, businesses, and external partners stimulates spontaneous innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.
    *   Breaking down silos through cooperation is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:47">[01:30:47]</a>.
    *   Not being afraid to dialogue with external partners and explain what challenges need solving leads to co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:38">[01:29:38]</a>.
*   **Investing in People and Management Models**:
    *   Training civil servants and managers to understand [[types and purposes of innovation in the public sector | innovation drivers and barriers]] is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.
    *   Managers play a critical role in keeping organizations running efficiently while being open to [[innovation in public services | innovation]] and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a>.
    *   Providing autonomy and tools for public servants to test new ways of doing things is a strong personal driver for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>.
    *   Upskilling people and building communities for exchanging practices are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Sharing Knowledge**:
    *   Sharing successes and failures, as well as learned lessons and good examples, within networks and communities is crucial to avoid replication of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>.
    *   Making strategic objectives public allows companies to understand future needs and deliver solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>.
*   **Focus on Real Needs/Problems**: Innovation initiatives should start with a real problem or need, rather than being solely ideation platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>. Public sectors should publish problem statements and allow companies to propose solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Personal commitment to fueling the [[innovation in public sector | innovation process]] in government includes fostering collaboration and cooperation domestically and abroad, as this is the only way to get things done and overcome organizational silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:36">[01:30:36]</a>. Continued efforts are needed to ensure that innovative approaches become embedded in the public administration's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>.

The [[Role of behavioral science in government policy | Role of Behavioral Science]] in Climate Adaptation

The OECD report, "Mind Shift Green Lift: Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy," highlights the crucial [[Role of behavioral science in government policy | role of behavioral science]] in addressing [[impact of human behavior on climate change | climate challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Achieving a green, low-carbon future necessitates changing the behaviors of individuals, businesses, and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Progress in the green transition requires a deep [[impact of human behavior on climate change | understanding of human behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> and is not possible with technical solutions alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Focusing on [[impact of human behavior on climate change | human behavior]] helps governments bridge the gap between ambitious goals and real-world impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Growing Emphasis on Climate Adaptation

Traditionally, [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science in environmental policy]] has predominantly focused on climate mitigation, aiming to reduce emissions and promote greener choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:44">[02:00:44]</a>. However, there is a significant and growing trend towards applying [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science]] to support climate adaptation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:39">[02:00:39]</a>. Climate adaptation involves adjusting behaviors to cope with both immediate and long-term effects of [[impact of human behavior on climate change | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>. This includes encouraging behaviors to prevent wildfires or guiding actions during crises like floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:11">[02:01:11]</a>. Effective climate adaptation policies must be grounded in how people actually behave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:18">[02:01:18]</a>. Therefore, policymakers are increasingly leveraging [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science]] to design smarter and more responsive adaptation strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:25">[02:01:25]</a>.

## Addressing Barriers to Adaptation

A case study from Australia illustrates the [[Role of behavioral science in government policy | role of behavioral science]] in climate adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:03">[02:11:03]</a>. During a severe drought from 2017 to 2019 in Eastern Australia, the Australian government's Behavioral Economics Team (BETA) conducted a study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:17">[02:22:17]</a>. They identified barriers and motivators influencing farmers' willingness to seek assistance to cope with the drought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:11">[02:22:11]</a>. Key behavioral barriers included:
*   Farmers knew about government assistance but didn't know how to concretely ask for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:45">[02:22:45]</a>.
*   The application process was overly complicated and lengthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>.
*   Farmers typically waited until their situation became critical before seeking help, partly due to the stigma attached to asking for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:11">[02:23:11]</a>.
*   Information provided was not personalized to farmers' specific situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:22">[02:23:22]</a>.

In response, BETA recommended reframing support with [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science]] to encourage farmers to seek assistance before a crisis point is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:32">[02:29:32]</a>. They also suggested establishing trusted local points of contact to further encourage farmers to seek and get help sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:47">[02:29:47]</a>.

## Strategic Implications and Concerns

While [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science]] has traditionally focused on mitigation, the increasing relevance of adaptation is due to the challenges in achieving significant mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:29">[02:46:29]</a>. Localized and adaptive climate solutions have huge potential, particularly in addressing immediate community responses to climate impacts like wildfires, which often call for [[impact of human behavior on climate change | behavioral solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:15">[02:47:15]</a>.

In the current political climate, climate adaptation is often perceived as more acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>. Even skeptical politicians tend to agree that action is needed when faced with observable climate impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:36">[01:26:36]</a>. This focus on adaptation strongly correlates with public acceptability and political willingness to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>. Many governments are now making more significant financial investments in adaptation than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:58">[01:26:58]</a>.

However, a concern is that greater emphasis on adaptation might divert resources and attention away from mitigation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>. Adaptation may be easier to gain support for due to its local, visible, and quicker effects, appealing to politicians focused on immediate constituent needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. It is crucial to maintain a clear hierarchy: mitigation (avoiding) should be the primary focus, followed by adaptation (adapting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>. The [[understanding_behavioral_science_in_environmental_policy | behavioral science community]] should investigate the potential backfiring effects of promoting adaptation behaviors on mitigation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Understanding Behavioral Science in Environmental Policy | Behavioral science]] provides valuable insights into how people make decisions, supporting governments in shaping better policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Shifting behaviors in key areas like transport, food consumption, and energy use could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. While the green transition requires a holistic approach combining technology, systemic changes, and [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science]], the latter is an indispensable tool for designing effective and inclusive policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. [[Role of Leadership and Governance in Behavioral Science | Governments]] are committed to accelerating the green transition and delivering policies that are effective, evidence-based, impactful, inclusive, and behaviorally informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>.

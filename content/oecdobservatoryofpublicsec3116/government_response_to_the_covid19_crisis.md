## The "New Normal" and Institutionalization

Discussions focused on what changes will stick and how to institutionalize them, particularly for future challenges like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

### Key Changes Expected to Stick
*   **Remote Work:** The shift to remote work is likely to become a norm, but governments still need to crack how to effectively measure productivity for remote staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.
*   **Proactive Planning & Investment:** The benefits of anticipating and investing in key areas (e.g., digital services, smart education) today to reap future rewards are clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

    *   The UAE's investment in smart education allowed a seamless migration to online schooling and led to a new digital school platform for refugees, addressing the digital divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.
*   **Agility in Regulation and Policymaking:** The "fast track" approach seen during the crisis may become a structured framework for high-priority urgent situations, coexisting with normal paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. The UAE plans to announce its agile framework to make this mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Data Governance and Literacy:** The need for robust data systems and skills to interpret data is being recognized as a proper platform for modern governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.
*   **Increased Reliance on E-services and Digital Transformation:** Governments will continue to develop and implement comprehensive online service delivery, using current positive trends in e-service usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.
*   **Internal Capacity Building:** Indonesia is investing in its health systems as part of a global health security agenda, building capacity to detect, prevent, and respond to emerging infectious diseases, including expanding its laboratory network and supporting domestic drug and vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

### Ensuring Changes Stick
While there is optimism for a "new normal," there's also a caution that changes might not last unless consciously worked upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.
*   **Conscious Effort:** The crisis, while impactful, may not have been "deep enough" to guarantee changes stick without deliberate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **"Remembering":** Continuously reflecting on the experience and learning from the process is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.
*   **Institutionalization:** Formalizing new measures and discovered gaps at all levels is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   **Foresight Units/Post-Crisis Committees:**
    *   The UAE developed a post-COVID strategy early on, with a dedicated team focused on opportunities and future investments (e.g., continuing space missions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.
    *   Indonesia established a committee with two task forces: one for COVID-19 control and another for a National Recovery Plan, including a focus on improving health systems for future outbreaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>.
    *   Montenegro has a National Coordination Body for future plans, though its work was affected by a change in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.
    *   Estonia is trying to build a foresight unit systematically within its teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.

### The Role of Government
Regarding the [[role_of_government_after_covid19 | role of government]] post-COVID-19:
*   Estonia, Montenegro, and Indonesia anticipate an **increase** in the [[role_of_government_after_covid19 | role of government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   The UAE expects a **decrease in size but an increase in importance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.

### Other Notable Aspects
*   **Mental Health Support:** Indonesia included psychologists/mental health experts in its COVID-19 task force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>, while the UAE had a general focus on mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. Estonia and Montenegro did not explicitly have this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   **Mandatory Mask Policies:** The UAE, Montenegro, and Indonesia all implemented mandatory mask policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>. Estonia had a voluntary but strongly recommended policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>.

## Conclusion

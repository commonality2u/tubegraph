An [[developing_innovation_proposals | innovation proposal]] is the process of transforming an idea into an actionable plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:46">[01:33:46]</a>. Even the best idea, if innovative, requires development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This principle applies whether the idea is for a personal workspace test or a whole-of-government initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. The objective of a proposal is to align the idea with the current reality and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. There isn't a single "magical answer" for what an innovation proposal should look like or how it will succeed, as it is highly dependent on its context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. However, there are commonalities across different proposal formats, whether it's an email to a manager, prototyping with colleagues, or an official budget proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. The proposal stage can be particularly nerve-wracking in the [[definition_and_challenges_of_innovation | innovation]] process, as it serves to validate the idea and secure necessary resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

### Tips for Developing Successful Public Sector Innovation Proposals

Several key considerations can enhance the success of [[developing_innovation_proposals | innovation proposals]] in the public sector:

*   **Understand the Strategic Context**
    An idea, no matter how good, will not gain traction if the strategic context is not right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. It is crucial to appreciate what else is happening, identify related agendas, and link the idea to political or executive leadership messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Framing or reframing the idea to better match the current context, or at least appear to, can be vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
*   **Rally People to Your Cause**
    A significant [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_innovation | challenge with innovation]] is its novelty, meaning there are often no existing mental models or examples for people to reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Effective communication tailored to the audience is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This involves adapting the message to decision-makers' preferences, considering if they prefer data, stories, or examples from other agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. Determining the most effective voice for the proposal, whether it's the proposer or someone else who can advocate the argument more strongly, is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Assume Understanding**
    Do not assume the merits of your idea are obvious or easily understandable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Novel ideas are prone to misinterpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. Your personal experience or research may not be enough to convince others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. To make a proposal real and meaningful, consider:
    *   Prototyping to make it visible and tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
    *   Finding peer voices to advocate for the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.
    *   Using concrete use cases, showing current failures and examples of success elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.
    *   Thinking through different future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.
*   **Know Your Numbers**
    Have a strong grasp of what you are asking for, why, and the expected results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. While the public sector often prefers certainty before approval, this is rarely possible with innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. Be ready for questions and acknowledge that the burden of proof for innovation is higher than for the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. Strategies include:
    *   Highlighting the cost and risks of continuing the current approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
    *   Starting small with a test case, though not all ideas can scale this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
    *   Promising with confidence, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.
    *   Looking for examples from other agencies, countries, or the private sector to show prior success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.
*   **Be Ready for the Unexpected**
    Anticipate potential outcomes and have a plan for "what if" scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. Consider what happens if the proposal is approved and needs to scale, or if new information undercuts your hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.
*   **Maximize Your Chances**
    While "fast failure" is a concept in [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | innovation]], the public sector generally seeks demonstrated value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. If an idea doesn't work as expected, seek other forms of learning or use the proposal to develop relationships with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. Aim for "multiple payoffs" from your efforts, regardless of direct success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
*   **Be Open to Change**
    Do not try to anticipate every detail; leave room for input from those receiving the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. Senior leaders often want to contribute their perspective and experience, not just sign off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

The amount of attention given to these tips can vary based on the proposal's scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. For large budget proposals, strategic context is a major consideration, while for small team ideas, simply being aware of agency priorities might suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. Similarly, [[engaging_stakeholders_in_innovation | rallying people]] for a small team idea might involve informal chats, whereas an agency-wide initiative requires much broader support and coalition building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

### Common Issues with Innovation Proposals

Several [[challenges_in_managing_innovation_within_public_sector_organizations | common issues]] can arise with innovation proposals:

*   **Decision-Makers' Understanding**
    Decision-makers may agree to an innovative proposal without fully understanding its implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>. This often occurs because novel ideas can be heard differently than intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. While proposers cannot get inside others' heads, they should watch for warning signs of misalignment between what is said and what is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Flexibility**
    Innovation inherently involves unexpected issues and deviations from initial proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>. It's crucial to avoid building critical dependencies that make the project vulnerable to surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. Being overly specific in a proposal, while avoiding responsibility, can lead to trouble when things do not go as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>.
*   **No Escape Clause**
    It's important to build in a way to exit a project if it doesn't work as hoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>. The public sector often has a tendency to continue investing in projects even when they are not working, which is detrimental to innovative initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. An escape clause is also useful if the project diverges from the original intent or if a successful project becomes solely dependent on the initiator, making it unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>.
*   **Information Balance**
    Finding the right balance of information for decision-makers is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:27]</a>. Avoid patronizing leaders, but also do not assume they know everything, especially with new concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>. Most people will not admit if they do not understand something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[22:45:00]</a>. Testing the proposal with both deeply familiar and loosely familiar individuals can help ensure the right balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.
*   **Scope Creep**
    Scope creep can occur in two ways:
    *   Adding too many features or ideas, making the project unrecognizable and dangerous for an innovation where testing key things is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>.
    *   Cutting out essential, interesting parts of the project, rendering it no longer truly innovative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>.
    While not always controllable, being aware of and identifying critical dependencies in the proposal can help mitigate this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Specific Challenges

#### Uncertainty of Impact
To address the uncertainty of an [[definition_and_challenges_of_innovation | innovation's]] impact in a convincing proposal, consider:
*   **Highlighting the Cost of the Status Quo:** Articulate that maintaining the current approach is not cost-neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging External Examples:** Find instances where similar ideas have been implemented elsewhere, providing data on costs or parameters to draw upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.
*   **Building a Story:** Craft a compelling narrative that emphasizes why the innovation matters, potentially overshadowing concerns about procedural details or exact costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.
*   **Securing Political/Senior Leadership Commitment:** When there's high-level backing, many traditional barriers and questions about worthiness can fall away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.

#### Proposal Rejection
If a proposal is rejected despite strong belief in the idea, strategies include:
*   **Patience:** Sometimes it's simply the wrong time, requiring waiting for a more opportune moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.
*   **Reframing:** Adjust the idea to better suit the current context, aligning with political signals and priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.
*   **Building a Coalition:** If the audience is not ready, identify people who can be brought along and build support for the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>.
*   **Finding Outside Voices:** Engage stakeholders or external experts who appreciate the idea and can advocate for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.
*   **Lateral Thinking/Workarounds:** Explore alternative approaches to advance the idea, sometimes working "behind the scenes" with limited resources, though this carries risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Reflection:** Ask why the idea isn't resonating or what insights you might be missing from the decision-makers' perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:26:00">[34:26:00]</a>.
*   **Finding Other Sponsors:** If direct management is too busy, seek out other internal sponsors, which also carries the risk of being seen as subverting the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>.

#### Communicating Failure
Communicating failure in [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_innovation | innovation projects]], especially in the public sector, requires careful reframing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>.
*   **Reframing Failure as Learning:** Instead of outright "failure," emphasize that the project was a test with limited exposure, and that learning was a primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:09:00">[36:09:00]</a>. This is especially true for projects with high uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05:00">[37:05:00]</a>.
*   **Highlighting Multiple Payoffs:** Ensure that every effort in an innovation project can have multiple benefits or forms of value, even if the primary objective isn't met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:00]</a>.
*   **Nuancing Success and Failure:** Recognize that success and failure are not always binary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>. External events can shift outcomes, and even a terminated project can yield long-term benefits like skill development or specific project elements continuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:00">[37:51:00]</a>.

#### Managing Expectations
Managing expectations, particularly with the "innovation" buzzword, requires:
*   **Building a Common Language:** Foster a shared understanding within the organization that innovation is inherently uncertain and can be uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:00">[31:06:00]</a>. True innovation involves not knowing what will happen and making people uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:34:00">[31:34:00]</a>.
*   **Bringing in External Voices:** Invite stakeholders, partner organizations, or other public sector agencies with experience in innovative projects to help shape more realistic and nuanced expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:08:00">[32:08:00]</a>.
*   **Securing Political Cover:** While risky due to potential leadership changes, political or senior leadership commitment can help navigate challenging expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>.

### Getting Started with Innovation Proposals
To begin the process of developing [[developing_innovation_proposals | innovation proposals]], especially with minimal risk:
*   **[[Problem framing in innovation | Problem Framing]] and Low-Fidelity Testing:** Frame the problem correctly and then conduct low or no-cost tests in a low-fidelity manner to gather feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>. This can involve simple methods like sketching wireframes on paper with duct tape instead of developing expensive mock-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>. These early tests validate hypotheses and strengthen the later proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>.
*   **Know Your Context:** Understand the unique environment for innovation within your specific public sector setting (e.g., US, Australia, Brazil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:00">[26:54:00]</a>.
*   **Start Small and Build Confidence:** Especially if new to [[definition_and_challenges_of_innovation | innovation]] or the organization, begin with small experiments within your own job context where you have discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:00">[28:23:00]</a>. Running experiments without needing permission can build confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>. Confidence is a key factor in successful proposals and pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:00">[29:25:00]</a>. Gradually involve colleagues or external individuals to develop ideas and strengthen your approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a>.

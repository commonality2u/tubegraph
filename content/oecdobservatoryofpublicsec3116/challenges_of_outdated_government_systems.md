Governments face significant challenges with outdated systems, necessitating innovation and adaptation to meet contemporary needs and future demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Reasons for Government Innovation

There are three primary reasons why governments need to innovate:

### 1. Unsolved Problems and Impactful Solutions
Governments have not yet solved all the problems faced by their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. By innovating and changing their approaches, governments can deliver new or better value for their citizens, leading to more impactful solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### 2. A Changing World and Adapting Systems
The world is constantly changing around governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Many foundational systems governments currently operate with, such as healthcare, welfare, and taxation, were designed in the 1950s and do not align with the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Key aspects of this change include:
*   **Digitalization and User Experience**
    Today, people conduct many activities online and expect a seamless and easy experience when interacting with government services, similar to other online services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This demand stems from the significant digitalization occurring globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Evolving Societal Needs**
    As societies change, so do the needs of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Governments must respond to these new needs and adapt to emerging systems driven by technology and digital use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The way people live their lives has fundamentally changed since the 1950s, requiring governmental adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Need for Adaptation**
    The environment surrounding governments is in flux, compelling them to adapt to these ongoing changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This requires [[adapting_government_systems_to_modern_needs | adapting government systems to modern needs]] and addressing [[challenges in digital government transformation | challenges in digital government transformation]].

### 3. Anticipating Future Challenges
Governments must also proactively look forward to fundamental changes and [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]] that lie ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This includes preparing for complex [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]] and uncertainties such as climate change, aging populations, and the emergence of new types of societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Anticipating the future requires innovation and different ways of thinking today to be ready for tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This foresight is crucial for how government functions and, more importantly, how people function in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Public institutions worldwide face the ongoing challenge of building and maintaining trust with citizens. A significant factor influencing this trust is the quality of public services [03:41]. When citizens experience difficulties or "frictions" in accessing government services, it can erode their perception of government responsiveness and reliability [04:50]. This article explores the concept of "sludge" as a key barrier in public service delivery and outlines the approaches and tools developed by the OECD and its partners to identify, measure, and reduce these unnecessary burdens.

## Understanding "Sludge" in Public Services

"Sludge" refers to unnecessary frictions that block access, impose psychological costs, and erode trust when engaging with public services [05:46]. It is a pervasive barrier, often leading to bureaucratic processes that prevent citizens from accessing essential services [05:56].

While the term "sludge" is relatively new, the underlying burden is not [07:05]. It provides a behavioral lens to conversations previously focused on administrative burdens or user experience simplification [07:11]. The goal of addressing sludge is not merely administrative efficiency, but rather to reshape public services to be more equitable, accessible, and trusted, particularly for vulnerable populations who are most reliant on these services [08:03].

### Examples of Sludge
Common examples of sludge in public services include:
*   Information that is hard to find [12:54]
*   Processes that are hard to understand or complete [12:57]
*   Very long waiting times without updates [13:00]
*   Complex decision points [13:11]

Often, sludge in government is unintentional; public servants do not purposely add frictions [12:41].

### Psychological Costs of Sludge
A key added value of focusing on "sludge" is the emphasis on psychological costs, which are often difficult to measure [13:30]. The OECD paper attempts to define and categorize these costs:
*   **Search costs**: Occur when people struggle to find information [14:07].
*   **Decision costs**: Experienced when evaluating options, especially when choices are similar, leading to psychological overload [14:17].
*   [[Challenges and strategies for innovative public services | Cognitive costs]]: Refer to the mental resources (or "brain capital") required to fulfill requirements or understand complex information [14:34].
*   **Emotional costs**: Include feelings of stress, disempowerment, anxiety, frustration, stigma, and loss of autonomy [15:01].

These psychological costs disproportionately impact vulnerable people [15:21]. Vulnerability is not limited to specific groups but can occur at different times in anyone's life, such as during natural disasters or childbirth [15:29]. Sludge has the highest impact when individuals are most vulnerable [15:53].

## The Sludge Audit Methodology

To address the challenges of identifying and measuring psychological costs, the OECD partnered with the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Customer Service in Australia to develop the Sludge Audit Method [16:13]. This methodology was inspired by Professor Cass Sunstein, who first conceptualized the idea of a sludge audit [16:48].

The NSW Sludge Audit Method aims to bring a behavioral science perspective to service improvement by:
*   Systematically using behavioral science evidence, making it accessible to service owners [17:40].
*   Quantifying different aspects of sludge, particularly psychological costs and equity aspects, which are harder to put a number value on [18:14].
*   Making sludge reduction easier through data-driven prioritization, guidance on how to fix problems, and measuring impact [18:43].

The method, tested on almost 100 audits, focuses on four key metrics: **time, cost, effort, and inclusion** [19:30]. The "effort" and "inclusion" components are particularly unique, as they codify behavioral science evidence [19:39].

## The International Sludge Academy

The first International Sludge Academy (ISA), a collaboration between the OECD and NSW, piloted the sludge audit methodology outside Australia [20:14]. It involved 16 teams from 14 countries who conducted parallel sludge audits [20:55]. Countries participated in masterclasses on the NSW method and received one-on-one mentorship [21:03].

### Key Learnings and Principles
The ISA revealed a strong global desire among governments to reduce sludge [21:41]. The participating governments audited a diverse range of processes, including citizen-facing public services and internal government processes like HR services [21:46].

From this international experience, nine good practice principles were identified to support governments in conducting sludge audits:

1.  **Deciding to do a sludge audit**: Assess the level of control over changing the process and implementing solutions. Ensure a clear line of sight between the audit and implementation, as the goal is to change a person's experience [23:19].
2.  **Having a predefined methodology**: A common, tested methodology offers rigor, allows for replication and comparisons across time and contexts (e.g., comparing license programs in different countries) [24:25].
3.  **Tailoring the audit to context**: Accommodate complicated, non-linear behavioral journeys and different customer types [25:04].
4.  **Deploying an equity lens**: Recognize that sludge disproportionately affects underserved communities [26:06]. This might mean focusing an audit purely on the experience of a vulnerable community, even if they represent a smaller percentage of customers [26:17].
5.  **Evaluating progress**: Use behavioral frameworks to improve services and re-audit to measure the impact of changes made [26:37].
6.  **System enablers**:
    *   Government commitment to improving user services [27:06].
    *   Close connection between the auditing team and service owners for better buy-in and data access [27:16].
    *   Systematic customer survey data to continuously gather feedback [27:49].

## International Case Studies

The ISA showcased the application of sludge audits in various national contexts:

### France: Assistance for Independent Living (APA) Application Process
The French behavioral insights team applied the sludge audit to the Assistance for Independent Living (APA) application process, an aid for elderly people to stay at home [30:47]. The administration noted high dropout rates due to complexity and varying versions of application letters across regions [31:10].

*   **Vulnerability focus**: This process was chosen because it impacts vulnerable elderly individuals who were not benefiting from aid due to complexity [31:45].
*   **Audit process**: Involved interviewing 20 people across nine departments (caregivers, applicants, departmental councils, support professionals), reviewing existing forms, and a step-by-step walk-through with applicants to understand time, effort, and emotional costs [32:12].
*   **Benefits**: The audit provided a user-centric perspective, an objective analysis of complexities, and insights into psychological costs and inclusion issues [34:04]. It helped prioritize the most problematic areas beyond just language simplification [33:31]. The process also showed the administration how to autonomously conduct such diagnoses [34:41].
*   **[[Challenges and solutions in public policy implementation | Challenges]]**: Lack of objective data required extensive information gathering [34:58]. The need for familiarity with the process by the auditor was identified as crucial for efficiency [35:14]. Discussions arose regarding whether a full-time sludge audit position or training various administrations would be more effective, and the ideal multidisciplinary team composition (design, simplification, behavioral insights) [35:22].

### Brazil: Gob.br Account Recovery Process
Brazil's Ministry of Management and Innovation Public Services audited the recovery of the Gob.br account, the main entry point to over 4,000 digital services [36:55]. While automated recovery via digital and facial recognition worked well for some, a large number of vulnerable users had to go through a more costly online form process [37:12]. With 150 million users and 100 million recovery requests annually, 6% of which used online forms, this represented a significant burden on the most vulnerable [37:42].

*   **Developing a local tool**: Inspired by the systematic approach of the NSW method, Brazil is developing its own tool adapted for Portuguese [38:16].
*   **Equity check**: The new tool aims to recognize different citizen journeys and identify where specific groups need more guidance to avoid sludge, functioning as an "equity check" [39:27].
*   **Scaling and accessibility**: The goal is to create a self-applied tool, with templates, guides, and tutorials, to be used not only by the federal government but also by states and municipalities across the country [40:03].
*   **Key takeaways**: Sludge audits are an excellent entry point for behavioral insights in government as they easily communicate barriers and results [40:56]. Audits themselves should be designed to avoid sludge (e.g., simplifying questionnaires) [41:09]. There's a need to find better labels for "sludge" and use a more positive frame for communication [41:33]. Finally, sludge reduction is crucial for promoting inclusiveness, equity, and public perception of services [41:59].

## Future Directions in Sludge Reduction

The OECD remains committed to leading in this field. Future plans include:
*   Developing an **OECD Recommendation on Human-Centered Public Administrative Services**, an international standard open for public consultation until July 7th [09:32]. This recommendation provides a common policy framework for designing and delivering services that prioritize people [09:57].
*   Launching the **Second Global Forum on Building Trust and Reinforcing Democracy** in Milan on October 21-22 [10:14].
*   Planning a **Second International Sludge Academy (ISA 2.0)** to further develop the method and expand its reach [42:39]. ISA 2.0 will emphasize peer learning among teams, leverage OECD publications and research, and invite experts from various fields like customer experience and data science [43:47].
*   Focusing on **benchmarking and international comparisons** to identify where sludge exists in common processes (e.g., passport renewal) and learn from best practices across countries [44:37].

The ultimate goal is to translate sludge audits into concrete changes on the ground, creating better services, better government, and a better world by giving people back their time [58:41].

[[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] (RaC) represents a significant innovation in public administration, offering a new approach to how governments create, diffuse, and enforce rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. It involves creating an official, machine-consumable version of rules that goes beyond traditional human-readable natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This approach allows rules to be understood and acted upon by computer systems consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) Primer
The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) launched a new innovation primer titled "Cracking the Code: Rulemaking for Humans and Machines" to explore this emerging concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This primer aims to provide a clear and understandable introduction to [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] as an emerging technology and approach relevant to the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. OPSI's mission includes helping governments uncover what's next, turning new ideas into core practice, and providing trusted advice on public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

The primer defines [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>:
*   **As an Output**: A coded version of rules that computers can understand and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. Coded rules already exist, as businesses and individuals create them based on government-provided natural language versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
*   **As an Approach**: A strategic, deliberate, and systemic method that conceives and creates machine-consumable rules from the outset of their creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. This approach significantly changes the "when, how, why, and for whom" rules are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

## Core Impacts on Public Administration and Policy Making

### Rethinking Core Government Functions
[[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] prompts a rethinking of rule-making, one of the core functions of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. It offers a "window into a different way of working for the public sector" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Enhanced Compliance and Policy Modeling
The adoption of [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] at scale could significantly alter how governments create, diffuse, and enforce rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. It can improve compliance and enable greater policy modeling by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, making it easier for people to understand their rights and obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Bridging the Translation Gap
A major issue in public administration is the "translation gap" between written legislation and its implementation on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. This gap often leads to misinterpretations, inconsistencies, and significant costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. For example, financial regulators found that providing prescriptive rules as an API could save individual banks millions annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.

[[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] helps close this gap by:
*   **Automated Processes**: Enabling automated monitoring, pattern analysis, and intelligence gathering on the impact and effectiveness of regulations and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.
*   **Reducing "Lawyers as Modems"**: Moving away from the costly and variable process of lawyers translating analog legal texts into digital formats for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
*   **Consistent Interpretation**: Facilitating easier and more consistent interpretation of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.

### Adapting to Digital Paradigms and User Needs
The digital transformation means that policy development must adapt. Policies often suffer when developed solely by policy experts, without input from service designers, technologists, end-users, or data specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] encourages [[interdisciplinary_collaboration_in_government_rulemaking | multi-disciplinary teams]] to test and rapidly implement new policies in an agile, test-driven way, ensuring policy intent is realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.

A critical shift is recognizing that **machines are also users of rules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. As digital systems become dominant and rules are embedded in the physical world, regulating non-human actors becomes essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. Unlike humans, machines are not responsive to legal, financial, or criminal pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Therefore, designing rules for machine consumption helps in developing new security, monitoring, and intervention paradigms suitable for the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.

### Designing Better Futures and Enhancing Trust
By shifting from a linear to an iterative and test-driven policy cycle, [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] allows for:
*   **Rapid Response**: Governments can respond quickly and confidently to changes, understanding the impact of policy changes across the entire regulatory and legislative system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.
*   **Higher Confidence**: Implementing policies after testing them in reality, rather than relying solely on academic modeling or hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.
*   **Improved [[role_of_rules_as_code_in_enhancing_transparency_and_accountability | Transparency and Accountability]]**: Co-drafting human and machine-readable rules simultaneously can lead to better human drafts and allows for real-world testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. This provides higher confidence, better automation, and improved testing, particularly when rules are available as an API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.
*   **Increased Scrutiny and Participation**: Publishing rules in code can open them to public consultation, allowing civil society, hackers, researchers, and developers to scrutinize policies, algorithms, and propose amendments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>. This fosters an alliance with external intelligence rather than fighting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.
*   **Addressing Information Asymmetry**: For example, in legislative debates, having rules published in code alongside budget bills can provide more objective information about the impact of proposed changes for legislators and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.
*   **Traceability and Auditing**: When decisions are made by systems, [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] allows for capturing the exact law it was based on and the data points included, enabling easier appeals and auditing of decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. This creates "trust infrastructure" where citizens can have visibility and transparency without relying solely on trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.

### Organizational and Cultural Shift
[[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] is not merely a technical shift but requires a "mind shift" and organizational change within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>. It necessitates breaking down silos and fostering [[interdisciplinary_collaboration_in_government_rulemaking | collaboration]] between economists, developers, and policy officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>. The ultimate goal is to change the very basic organization of government to achieve user-centric, impact-driven results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>.

## Challenges and Limitations
Despite its potential, [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] is still in an early stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Key considerations include:
*   **Focus on Prescriptive Rules**: [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] is primarily suited for prescriptive rules or where precedents are clearly defined. It is not about automating judgment, justice, or discretion in complex cases, which will always require human intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. The aim is to free up civil servants from easy-to-automate tasks to focus on complex ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Technocratic Fantasies**: The goal is not to automate or disintermediate everything, but to improve the quality of public service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. It's crucial not to confuse RaC with machine learning that might perpetuate past mistakes or lead to unaccountable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.
*   **Starting Small and Iterating**: Governments should identify specific areas with a clear need for [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] and start with prototypes, iterating over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. This aligns with effective strategies for [[adapting_public_administration_for_digital_transformation | digital transformation]] in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:59">[00:58:59]</a>.
*   **Overcoming the Policy-Implementation Chasm**: There is currently a "chasm" rather than a continuum between policy and implementation, leading to a loss of policy intent and unknown outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] is a part of the broader necessary shift to close this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.

## Real-World Examples
*   **France**: Began with the open-sourcing of "OpenFisca" in 2013, a simulation software for tax and social rules, which evolved into tools for citizens to understand their rights and obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This platform attracted contributors from administration, NGOs, private companies, and researchers, creating a system driven by concrete uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Projects like "Lex Impact" aim to make the impact of policy changes more readable and predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>.
*   **New Zealand**: Pioneered the "Better Rules" initiative, providing a theoretical framework for [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] that complemented France's practical implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
*   **Canada**: Has also been striving to implement [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] initiatives in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.

## Future Implications
The [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | Covid19 crisis]] has highlighted the need for governments to be resilient, effective, and responsive to rapid, exponential change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. [[rules_as_code_concept_and_implementation | Rules as Code]] is a vital part of this broader transformation, allowing governments to become a platform upon which citizens can thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>. It's about how to engage with people and machines effectively, paving the way for a more augmented public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:24">[01:18:24]</a>.

Effective public administration is central to building and maintaining [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust between government and society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The importance of this agenda is highlighted by the OECD, particularly in the current global context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Governments worldwide are increasingly focusing on putting the public back into public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Innovation as a Core Requirement
Innovation in public services is no longer optional; it is essential for addressing complex challenges like inequality, climate change, and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. It is also crucial for [[building_trust_in_public_institutions | building trust]] as the state addresses the needs of each citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Key Objectives of Government Innovation
Governments pursue several objectives to innovate public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>:
*   Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Increasing public satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   Enhancing the uptake of services, especially for vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   Ensuring fairness and equal treatment in government-citizen relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Human-Centric Approach
A strategic and consistent approach to public service innovation is emerging globally, emphasizing the human element and placing people at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This requires a cultural shift in bureaucracy to ensure citizens are at the heart of public services, especially during important life events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The OECD recommends human-centric public administrative services, looking at best practices for refocusing efforts on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Driving Innovation for Trust
### Brazil's Approach
Brazil views innovation as a requirement for improving citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Its approach is human-centered, ensuring services are efficient, inclusive, and transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Innovation is seen as creative problem-solving, not just technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE|Brazil's Innovations]
*   **National Digital Government Strategy**: Promotes digital transformation across all Brazilian states and municipalities, making digital government services easily accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. It was developed collaboratively with public servants, experts, and users, mobilizing 2,000 people digitally and in all 27 states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **gov.br Digital Identity**: A significant achievement, allowing 160 million citizens (75% of the population) to access over 2,500 digital public services easily, agilely, and transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This was a priority during Brazil's G20 presidency, leading to the development of general principles on digital identity governance in partnership with the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Unified Early Childhood Registry**: Integrates various data sources (social assistance, daycare, school enrollments, vaccines, food security) into a single platform for individualized monitoring of children, enabling more effective public policies and personalized access to essential services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Inclusion Initiatives**: Brazil addresses gender and race issues by preparing women and Black women for leadership positions through the national school of public administration, and integrating these themes into civil servant training programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **K Collabora Program**: A federal government collaboration initiative centralizing personal management, procurement, and budget execution in a single agency, increasing efficiency and reducing costs while prioritizing citizen and public servant needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.
*   **Unified Government Hiring Process**: Developed by public servants, this process reached 1.5 million candidates in its first edition, decentralizing entrance exams to allow candidates from all 5,555 municipalities to participate, democratizing access to civil service positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Contratamais Brazil (Procurement Program)**: Revolutionizes public procurement by making it more inclusive and efficient, inspired by a city project that reduced bureaucracy and opened doors for small and medium-sized companies in government contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.

### Portugal's Approach
Portugal has long prioritized innovation in public service as a strategic imperative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE|Portugal's Innovations]
*   **LabX (Center for Innovation in Public Sector)**: Housed within the Agency of Administrative Modernization (AMA), LabX fosters innovation through experimentation, testing, refining, and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. It involves research to understand user needs, co-creation with citizens, researchers, startups, and public servants, and experimentation before full implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **National Digital Strategy**: Aims for public services to proactively meet citizen and business needs, enhancing efficiency and reducing bureaucracy by putting users at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. The goal is to simplify lives through seamless digital public services, transforming existing processes rather than just digitizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Omni-channel Service Approach (gov.pt brand)**: Launched last year, this integrates a single digital service portal (gov.pt web portal), a new gov.pt mobile app, a single citizen phone line, and in-person support channels (citizen shops and spots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. This ensures a high-quality experience regardless of interaction method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
    *   **Citizen Spots**: Over 930 spots across Portugal provide direct and mediated support to access digital public services, assisting citizens with over 60 digital services, from ID renewals to legal certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>. They also serve as learning hubs where citizens receive personalized guidance to gain confidence in using digital services autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.
*   **Mosaic Reference Model**: A mandatory common reference model that provides clear guidelines and a common structure for designing citizen-centric digital services, ensuring consistency across public services offered by multiple entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. It includes the Agura design system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   **Technological Architecture**: Simplifies citizen access to public services through building blocks like `authentication.gov` (single sign-on, user authentication and authorization) and the Interoperability Platform for Public Administration Services (IIP) which supports the "once-only" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Innovation Matrix for Monitoring and Evaluating Public Service**: A tool in development to help evaluate and improve public services using accurate data, monitoring quality, identifying areas for improvement, setting benchmarks, and continuously innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. This reflects a commitment to data-driven innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Civic Participation through Digital Technologies (participate.gov.pt)**: A national civic engagement platform using secure digital identification and blockchain technology to allow citizens to propose and vote on ideas and monitor public decisions transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>.
*   **Portuguese Simplex Program**: Focuses on simplifying user experience, mitigating unnecessary bureaucracy, and integrating digital solutions by design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. It empowers citizens to propose ideas that reduce administrative burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.

### Canada's Approach
In Canada, [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | trust is a critical issue]] for the public service, especially given current scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. Building trust leads to improved engagement, better compliance with regulations, and adoption of new service innovations like digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. Trust is fragile and easily lost; every citizen interaction shapes confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE|Canada's Initiatives]
*   **Passport Service Guarantee**: In response to pandemic-era surges in demand, Canada is experimenting with a money-back guarantee for passport services if not delivered within a certain timeframe, showing the government has "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.
*   **Human-Centric Digital Standards**: Canada has adopted digital standards that require openness in tool development and invite users to participate in the design, delivery, and implementation of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Old Age Benefits Transformation**: The largest transformation in Canadian government history, moving old age benefits to a modern platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. An immediate benefit has been reducing errors, which in the real world can mean loss of essential financial support or overpayments that create financial pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. Reducing errors strengthens [[citizen_trust_and_public_communication | citizen trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
*   **Addressing Unequal Access**: Recognizing Canada's vast geography and multiple time zones, efforts are focused on digital infrastructure build-out to ensure all Canadians have equal access to services, regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Literacy and User-Friendly Design**: Programs are shaped to adapt language and interface quality for ease of use across various digital devices, ensuring accessibility for different levels of digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   **Life Events and Life Journeys View**: Shifting from a product-based view to designing service interfaces from the client's perspective, bundling all necessary services around life events (e.g., a death in the family, welcoming a child, retirement) in an intuitive way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. Future plans include greater integration to reduce information repetition, moving towards a "tell us once" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.
*   **Redefining Efficiency**: Efficiency should not solely focus on savings but also on improving product quality (accuracy, timeliness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>. It should consider how products reach clients and integrate into their lives, including interactions with other actors like banks and local communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.
*   **Client Feedback**: Measuring pain points and pressures through client surveys and instant feedback to iteratively correct problems created inadvertently by digital or policy solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.
*   **Re-innovating Existing Solutions**: Innovation doesn't always mean new things; sometimes it means revisiting and enhancing existing, forgotten solutions with new technology or processes. For example, a past initiative for proactive involvement in benefit programs (like pensions) can be greatly enhanced with today's technology to provide automatic access to benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>.

### European Union's Perspective
The EU recognizes that public administrations must play a key role in fostering a more dynamic and innovative business environment, simplifying procedures, reducing administrative burdens, and creating more user-centric public services across its 27 member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE|EU's Initiatives]
*   **Reducing Reporting Obligations**: The EU aims for a 25% reduction in reporting obligations for companies, potentially saving up to 37 billion euros annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
*   **Once-Only Principle**: Essential for overcoming barriers, ensuring businesses and individuals are asked for information only once, with administrations handling data thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Interoperability**: Requires full interoperability between public administrations, including across countries, by harmonizing standards and ensuring data is machine-readable, semantically, and legally operable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
*   **Compact Communication**: Launched to strengthen the European administrative space and accelerate digital and green transformation, as well as build skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

## Introduction to Public Sector Innovation 101

Public Sector Innovation 101 serves as an introduction to how the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) views public sector innovation, including the critical concept of [[problem_framing_in_innovation|problem framing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Kevin Oren, an innovation specialist at OPSI, explains that this field is often perceived as daunting, like programming a complex robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. However, OPSI aims to break down innovation into accessible building blocks, moving beyond celebrating only massive successes to recognizing the "sloppier part" where things fail and the behind-the-scenes work that makes innovation achievable for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## What is Innovation?

There isn't one single, universally agreed-upon definition of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Innovation is highly contextual; what is innovative in one country or organization might not be in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

However, OPSI has identified three common factors:
*   **Novelty:** Introducing new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Implementation:** Having creative ideas is only part of the lifecycle; ideas must actually be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Impact:** The implementation must have a measurable impact, though measuring this can be challenging, especially for truly new activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Why Public Sector Innovation is Needed
Based on studies, including one in Canada, OPSI highlights several reasons for the necessity of public sector innovation:
*   **Changing Functions:** The constant changes in the world, particularly in private lives, create expectations for government to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Closing the Gap:** There's a perceived gap between private and public sector services. Governments are pushing hard just to maintain this gap, rather than closing it, requiring a rethink of value delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **No Room for Spectators:** Relying only on innovation labs or specialized training limits a government's ability to innovate. Everyone needs to be engaged in some way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Citizens and Politicians Want More:** With increasing possibilities, citizens and politicians have higher expectations. Failure to respond risks a mismatch where government services no longer align with citizens' desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Core Competency:** Innovation needs to be embedded everywhere as a core competency to better respond to crises and continually rethink how government serves citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

### Ways to View Innovation
OPSI categorizes innovation into three distinct perspectives:
*   **Delivering on Today:** Mission-driven innovation to produce better value based on current goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **Delivering on Tomorrow:** Anticipatory innovation, looking at "weak signals" and future trends like AI or automated cars, and innovating around them today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Readiness:** Building capacity and capability to innovate when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

### Key Skill Areas for Innovators
Beyond core job skills, public servants need additional "skill areas" to think differently:
*   **Iteration:** Doing things quickly, cheaply, and with reduced risk to get faster feedback and better results, like Canada's experiment mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Data Literacy:** Understanding how data provides insights into problems and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **User-Centricity:** Placing the end-user (citizen) at the center of design, rather than focusing solely on internal process efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Curiosity:** Asking questions, seeking new ways, and horizon scanning for cutting-edge approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Storytelling:** Creating compelling, concise, and memorable stories that resonate with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Insurgency:** Questioning the status quo and trying new things. These "pains in the butt" can be the best source for identifying what's wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

These skills are effective when combined with the AMO (Abilities, Opportunities, Motivation) model, ensuring public sector employees have the opportunity and incentive to use these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## The Innovation Lifecycle

OPSI has developed a six-step innovation lifecycle, acknowledging that many variations exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>:
1.  **Identifying Problems:** Ensuring the right problem is being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
2.  **Generating Ideas:** Coming up with new, inclusive, and collaborative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
3.  **Developing Proposals:** Filtering ideas to determine which ones to pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
4.  **Implementing:** Putting the selected ideas into action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
5.  **Evaluating:** Assessing the outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
6.  **Diffusing:** Sharing best practices and lessons learned (from both successes and failures) across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

It's crucial to understand that this is not a linear process; one may need to revisit previous stages, for example, if ideas don't solve the identified problem or if the problem definition needs refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## [[problem_framing_in_innovation|Problem Framing]]

[[problem_framing_in_innovation|Problem framing]] is the first and foundational stage of the innovation lifecycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### The GE MRI Machine Example
Doug Dietz of GE developed a world-class MRI machine but received complaints that children were terrified of it, leading to 80% needing sedation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Instead of framing it as a design flaw or technology failure, Dietz reframed the problem around the *experience* of using the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. By transforming the MRI machine into an "adventure" (e.g., pirate ships, outer space) and having technicians tell stories, sedation rates dropped to under 10% with only a few hundred dollars spent on paint and scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This demonstrates how reframing a problem can lead to simple yet profound solutions.

### The Double Diamond Design Methodology
The "Double Diamond" is a traditional design methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The first diamond focuses on framing the problem, involving stages of **Discovery** (understanding the problem) and **Definition** (narrowing down the actual problem) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. The second diamond is about finding the solution, involving **Ideation** (coming up with new ideas) and **Delivery** (recommending and testing solutions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

The challenge in government is that public servants often skip the first diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. They might be given a pre-defined problem or even a solution to implement, thus bypassing the crucial problem-definition phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. This solution-focused mentality can lead to disappointing results, missed impacts, and a cycle of constantly seeking new solutions without addressing the root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

### Why Governments Struggle with [[problem_framing_in_innovation|Problem Framing]]
Based on OPSI's lifecycle report, several factors contribute to this struggle:
*   **Pressure for Quick Responses:** Governments often prioritize immediate solutions over thoroughly understanding the problem, leading to addressing symptoms rather than root causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
*   **Complexity and Intimidation:** New information can make problems appear large, complex, and unwieldy, potentially overwhelming individuals or moving beyond their scope of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
*   **Evolving Problems:** Problems can change over time, requiring continuous re-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

### The Problem Framing Process
New information should trigger a series of questions to better frame a problem:
1.  What is **known**? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>
2.  What is **possible**? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>
3.  What is **expected**? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>
4.  What is **needed**? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>
5.  What is the **problem**? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>

This process is cyclical, with continuous feedback and new information prompting ongoing evaluation and potential adjustments to solutions or even a complete redefinition of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

### Tips for Better [[problem_framing_in_innovation|Problem Framing]]
Individuals and groups can improve their [[problem_framing_in_innovation|problem framing]] by:
*   **Clarifying Intent:** Clearly defining what is trying to be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Making Assumptions Explicit:** Differentiating facts from assumptions to challenge and verify information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Jumping to Conclusions:** Resisting the urge to immediately move to solutions after a brief look at the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.
*   **Connecting with Others:** Being inclusive and collaborative to gain diverse experiences and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.
*   **Reframing the Problem:** Approaching the problem from different perspectives to uncover new solutions (e.g., hot weather problem reframed as clothing appropriateness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.
*   **Experimentation:** Using experimentation in the problem space itself, not just for solutions, to better understand the underlying issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

### Common [[problem_framing_in_innovation|Problem Identification]] Tools and Strategies
Various tools and strategies can aid in [[problem_framing_in_innovation|problem identification]]:
*   **Dashboards:** Provide data on what is being measured but often don't articulate the "why" behind issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.
*   **Horizon Scanning:** Looking at what's happening in similar or different problem spaces, including other organizations or countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.
*   **Design Thinking / Human-Centered Design:** Methodologies focused on user-centricity to design experiences and services that meet citizen needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.
*   [[systems_thinking_in_innovation|Systems Thinking]]: Adopting a holistic lens to understand all actors and dynamics influencing a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Insights:** Understanding how people behave and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Learning:** Collaborating with peers facing similar challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   **Learning Organizations:** Continuously seeking new methods and ways of doing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.
*   **Innovation Labs:** Structured environments for fostering innovation, though their effectiveness depends on proper structuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.

Each tool has strengths and weaknesses; understanding these is crucial for effective problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

### Practical Exercise: The Five Whys
A simple yet effective exercise for [[problem_framing_in_innovation|problem framing]] is the "Five Whys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. Define the current problem and then repeatedly ask "why is that happening?" to uncover deeper root causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. For instance, a customer satisfaction score not improving for five years, initially attributed to various anecdotal reasons, was unpacked using the Five Whys. Connecting with end-users revealed issues of complexity and slowness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. Asking "why are we too complex?" led to examining processes and policies, eventually revealing that a confusing website was a major contributor to customer dissatisfaction. Simple website tweaks then directly improved satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_solutions_in_foresight_implementation|Challenges and Solutions in Foresight Implementation]]

### Overcoming Resistance to Innovation
A common challenge is leaders talking about innovation without addressing underlying issues, and organizations getting stuck at believing they are innovative simply because they have a few "innovative projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. To overcome this:
*   **Own Your Influence:** Focus on areas where you have direct control or influence, even if it's only a small part of a larger process. Improve those steps and influence others to adopt new ways of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.
*   **"Doing Things in the Shadow":** Quietly testing and iterating solutions before presenting them to management can build momentum and demonstrate value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.
*   **Leader Training:** Sending leaders to innovation training, even short design cycles, can help them understand iteration, experimentation, and prototyping, making them more receptive to these approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

### Navigating Conservative Cultures
Most public sectors are risk-averse, driven by political, media, or financial concerns (taxpayer funds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>. [[overcoming_challenges_in_innovation_proposals|Overcoming challenges in innovation proposals]] requires:
*   **Resiliency:** Innovators need to be resilient, willing to push through stumbling blocks, and build a network of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.
*   **Advocacy at All Levels:** Innovation is advocated for by organizations like OPSI, national governments, citizens, and public sector employees from the bottom up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.

### [[policy_challenges_and_strategic_approaches|Policy Challenges and Strategic Approaches]]: Iteration vs. Long-Term Planning
There is tension between traditional government models of studying something for years before implementation and the need for prototyping and iterating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.
*   **Critique of Long-Term Plans:** Five-year plans are often ineffective for major transformation, as predicting the future is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. Countless government projects spending millions or billions of dollars have failed or become sunk costs due to this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.
*   **Embracing Experimentation:** The key is to challenge the perception that traditional methods are more successful or reduce risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. It's about getting people to "roll up their sleeves" and try different methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
*   **Silicon Valley Mindset (Reid Hoffman):** Instead of "celebrating failure," the goal is to acknowledge that the right answer isn't known at first. The approach should be to study the problem, identify a few best solutions, and then test them quickly and cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. Even if all fail, valuable insights are gained, leading to more informed and higher-chance investments later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. This approach leads to quicker results and a higher chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.

## Continuing the Conversation

OPSI encourages continued engagement through its community group, found on the OPSI website. This platform provides resources, survey opportunities for feedback, and a space to ask questions and connect with international peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. The OPSI website also offers a wealth of information, blogs, and resources, while the bi-weekly newsletter provides updates on research and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>.

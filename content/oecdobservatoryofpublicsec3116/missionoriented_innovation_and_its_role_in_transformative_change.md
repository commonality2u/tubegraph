## Introduction
The concept of "missions" has emerged as a crucial approach for addressing complex societal challenges, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These [[Mission Oriented Innovation | missions]] represent new opportunities to think about future challenges and avoid global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation actively works on both anticipatory and [[Mission oriented innovation | mission-oriented approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The OECD has also launched a Missions Action Lab to concentrate on effective [[Mission oriented innovation | mission implementation]] in agile and iterative ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Characteristics of [[Mission Oriented Innovation | Missions]]
[[Mission Oriented Innovation | Missions]] are defined as broad, future-oriented objective statements set with a timeline, providing directionality and intentionality for where society wants to be in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. They are designed to be "future-proof" or at least future-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

## Examples of [[Mission Oriented Innovation | Missions]] in Practice

### European Commission
The European Commission's DG Research and Innovation launched five major [[Mission oriented innovation | missions]] at the end of September, with significant funding from the Horizon Europe program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. These [[Mission oriented innovation | missions]] are designed to integrate across the entire EU policy agenda through a robust governance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
The five [[Mission oriented innovation | missions]] include:
*   **Conquering Cancer**: Targeting more than three million lives saved, living longer and better by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Climate Resilient Europe**: Aiming to prepare Europe for climate disruptions and accelerate transition to a healthy and prosperous future by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Mission Starfish (Restoring Oceans and Waters)**: Seeking to clean marine and fresh waters and restore degraded ecosystems and habitats by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **100 Climate Neutral Cities**: Supporting, promoting, and showcasing 100 citizen-led systemic transformations towards climate neutrality by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Caring for Soil (Caring for Life)**: Targeting at least 75% of EU soils to be healthy for food, people, nature, and climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The development of these [[Mission oriented innovation | missions]] involved foresight, evidence gathering, expert mission boards, and extensive citizen engagement through participative and dialogue techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. These [[Mission oriented innovation | missions]] extend beyond the framework program and involve investments from other sources, ensuring their continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.

### Denmark
Denmark is focusing its attention on [[Mission oriented innovation | missions]] and [[Mission oriented innovation | mission-driven innovation]] beyond COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The Innovation Fund Denmark invests in entrepreneurs, researchers, and businesses to create value and develop solutions for societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
The Danish government's Green Research Strategy (September 2020) highlights four specific green research and innovation [[Mission Oriented Innovation | missions]]:
*   Capture and storage or use of CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   Green fuels for transport and industry (e.g., Power-to-X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   Climate and environment-friendly agriculture and food production, including new food types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   Circular economy with a focus on plastics and textiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

These partnerships aim to contribute to a 70% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050, while also increasing biodiversity and the competitiveness of Danish industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Denmark emphasizes accelerating investments and developing solutions across the full value chain, including technological, financial, and regulatory roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. The approach highlights urgency and a "build the road while driving on it" mentality, fostering a learning mindset among partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Norway
Norway's digital strategy for the public sector prioritizes seamless services for seven "life events" to make everyday life easier for citizens, businesses, and voluntary sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. These life events represent "wicked problems" requiring systemic changes and new ways of sharing data, regulating work, prioritizing financing, and organizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
Two life events, "seriously ill children" and "starting/running a voluntary organization," are exploring a [[Mission Oriented Innovation | mission approach]] due to their cross-sectoral nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. This approach combines ambitious top-down goals with broad bottom-up efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Strategic foresight is used to future-proof these services, analyzing driving forces for change, potential impacts, and developing future personas to challenge assumptions and inform present actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

## Challenges in [[Mission oriented innovation challenges and implementation | Mission Implementation]]
*   **Political Commitment**: Securing long-term commitment from political leaders for [[Mission Oriented Innovation | missions]] that extend beyond their term of office is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty**: The future is uncertain, and [[Mission Oriented Innovation | missions]] must be adaptable to changing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Climate and societal challenges are perceived as areas with the highest uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
*   **"Mission Washing"**: A significant danger is merely labeling existing activities as "missions" without genuinely changing how work is delivered or fostering true innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
*   **Technological Bias**: Many [[Mission oriented innovation | missions]], particularly those focused on climate change, tend to be highly technological or scientific, often overlooking behavioral dimensions, social norms, or changes in population habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. This can lead to a belief that technology alone will solve problems without requiring lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>.
*   **Siloed Thinking**: Breaking down topical silos within governments (e.g., between green initiatives and citizen well-being) is crucial but difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:58">[01:09:58]</a>.

## Strategies for [[Mission oriented innovation strategies and practices | Future-Proofing and Transformative Change]]

### Co-creation and Stakeholder Engagement
[[Mission Oriented Innovation | Missions]] are inherently co-created by diverse actors, including different sectors (public, private, voluntary), researchers, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This ensures shared objectives and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Examples include visionary councils in Japan that include science fiction novelists to encourage future thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. In Denmark, partnerships co-create roadmaps, allowing different stakeholders, including financial institutions, to see where they fit in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

### Agile and Iterative Approaches
To avoid lock-in, [[Mission Oriented Innovation | missions]] need to be pursued in agile and iterative ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This means adapting quickly when conditions change and having dynamic processes to check their future fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. A learning mindset is crucial, acknowledging that the future is uncertain and plans will evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. Governance models and investment plans should allow for flexibility, integrating new partners and financing new ideas over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.

### Role of Foresight
Strategic foresight helps to:
*   **Uncouple from Present Problems**: Move discussions away from today's obstacles to focus on what is needed for the future, fostering innovative ideas and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.
*   **Understand Future Contexts**: Analyze driving forces for change, potential impacts, and reframe future contexts through scenario planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.
*   **Challenge Assumptions**: Develop future personas to provide a user perspective for future citizens, helping to see beyond current generational biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.
*   **Identify Risks and Opportunities**: Co-create desired futures while remaining aware of risks and developing alternative scenarios based on uncertainties and interdependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

### Governance and Funding Models
Effective [[Mission oriented innovation strategies and practices | mission implementation]] requires:
*   **Clear Decision Points and Monitoring**: Establishing analytical frameworks to monitor performance and allow for periodic steering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. The European Commission, for instance, has regular reviews to assess progress and adjust plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.
*   **Cross-Policy Integration**: Ensuring that [[Mission oriented innovation | missions]] are robustly developed and agreed upon across all relevant policy areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Approach**: Managing [[Mission Oriented Innovation | missions]] as a portfolio of projects that collectively contribute to the broader objective, allowing for adaptation at lower objective levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.
*   **Connecting Policy to Practice**: Establishing direct lines of communication between on-the-ground partnerships and senior government officials to identify and address political barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.

### Addressing Intergenerational Fairness and Behavioral Aspects
*   **Intergenerational Justice**: Designing processes for deep and effective participation, giving voice to future generations (e.g., through public dialogues involving perspectives for 2060) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>.
*   **Inclusion of Social Sciences and Humanities**: Moving beyond purely technological solutions to address behavioral change and social implementation is critical for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Integrating social science and humanities helps understand how consumers and the public adopt new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>.
*   **Rethinking Evidence and Power**: Policy analysts and makers need to understand the nature of evidence and power dynamics in these complex endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

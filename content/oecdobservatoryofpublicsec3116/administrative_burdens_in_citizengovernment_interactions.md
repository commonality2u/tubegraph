Administrative burdens are the negative interactions or frictions people experience when interacting with government. These burdens are captured as a series of costs borne by individuals accessing public services and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## What are Administrative Burdens?
Professors Pam Herd and Don Moynihan, authors of "Administrative Burden: Policymaking by Other Means," define administrative burdens through three types of costs:
*   **Learning Costs**
    These involve the effort and time spent searching for information about public services and determining their relevance or eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. An example is navigating the complex Medicare health insurance system in the US, which requires individuals to understand numerous choices that can significantly impact healthcare access and financial costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Compliance Costs**
    These are the tangible efforts and resources required to follow rules and requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. They include paperwork, waiting times, fees, and the collection and provision of documentation to prove eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. A prime example is the annual renewal process for the Medicaid program in the US, where many eligible individuals lose coverage due to the complexity of the paperwork and documentation required, leading to "churn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **[[psychological_and_emotional_costs_in_public_service_access | Psychological Costs]]**
    This category broadens the understanding beyond traditional "stigma" to include stress, loss of autonomy, frustration, and even fear that individuals experience while navigating public processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. These costs are particularly significant as they impact levels of trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Instances like a single mother struggling to access food stamp documents during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a> or children losing health insurance coverage due to altered forms in Tennessee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a> highlight the fear and anxiety these burdens can promote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Key Lessons from Research
A growing body of research in the last decade has shed light on critical aspects of administrative burdens:
*   **Small Burdens, Large Impacts**
    Even seemingly minor burdens can have substantial effects on access to services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. For example, in a US student loan forgiveness program, having a loan provider fill out the application form (requiring only a signature and email from the applicant) increased application rates from 24% to 60%, resulting in an average monthly payment reduction of $125 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This demonstrates how a simple change can overcome a "seemingly small burden" with "really large impacts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   **Implications for Inequality**
    Administrative burdens often reinforce existing patterns of inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
    *   Individuals most in need of help are often the least equipped to obtain it due to limited resources, language barriers, illness, cognitive disabilities, or lack of time/money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
    *   People perform less effectively under conditions of scarcity, stress, or poor health, which are common among those needing public assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
    *   In the US, programs for middle-class individuals tend to be easier to navigate than those for low-income populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. For instance, employer-subsidized health insurance for middle-class individuals is simple, while Medicaid for the poor is "incredibly complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness of Automatic Renewal / Shifting Burdens to the State**
    The most effective way to reduce burdens is through automatic processes, which shift the burden from individuals to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. While "nudges" can help with learning costs, they are less effective when high compliance and [[psychological_and_emotional_costs_in_public_service_access | psychological costs]] are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Automating processes is critical for increasing [[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | participation in public programs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_reducing_bureaucratic_frictions | Strategies for Reducing Burdens]] (US Context)
The Biden-Harris Administration has made [[strategies_for_reducing_bureaucratic_frictions | reducing administrative burdens]] a priority, influencing both state and federal public policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Biden-Harris Administration Initiatives**
    Early executive orders focused on racial equity and improving customer experience, explicitly linking burden reduction to enhancing trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. The administration has issued guidance to agencies on how to measure and reduce burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
*   **New Tools and Practices**
    The customer experience executive order promoted human-centered design as a policy tool for designing and reviewing government processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. This systematic application of design practices is a relatively new approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
*   **Repurposing Existing Processes**
    The administration has required agencies to focus on measuring and reporting on customer experience and burden reduction within their annual budget and performance reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The Paperwork Reduction Act, traditionally focused on time spent on forms, was reinterpreted by the Office of Management and Budget to include learning, compliance, and psychological costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

## Examples of Burden Reduction in Practice
*   **Medicaid Automatic Renewal (Ex Parte)**
    The Medicaid program requires annual eligibility renewal, leading to high administrative barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. The Biden Administration encouraged states to expand automatic renewal (known as "ex parte"), utilizing existing laws that allow states to renew eligibility if they possess the necessary data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. This initiative led to a significant increase in automatic renewals, from approximately 25% to nearly 50% nationally, saving millions of people from paperwork and the risk of losing coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.
*   **Minnesota Medicaid Project**
    In Minnesota, a project with Code for America (a nonprofit Civic Tech firm) aimed to expand automatic renewal for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled population, who are particularly vulnerable to paperwork struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Code for America used their technological skills to help the state organize and connect administrative data sources to provide case workers with easily digestible eligibility information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. This intervention increased automatic renewal rates for this population from about 40% to approximately 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. Additionally, the project helped reduce inequalities, as non-white families, especially Black families, saw their enrollment rates increase to align with other families, demonstrating how automatic renewal can "level the playing fields" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   **US Digital Service Intervention**
    The US Digital Service (USDS), a Civic Tech organization within the government, visited states to help improve Medicaid renewal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. These "tiger teams" provided technical capacity (identifying data sources, reviewing code) and policy capacity (clarifying policy flexibility, maximizing opportunities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. The intervention helped four lower-performing states raise their automatic renewal rates to the national average, even as the national average was increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations
*   **Automation and Bias**
    While technology can improve services, blind faith in automation can lead to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. Examples from Australia and the Netherlands show how algorithms used for fraud detection in welfare or childcare benefits can go wrong, introducing bias, false positives, and shifting greater burdens onto clients by requiring them to prove eligibility or innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. In the Dutch case, these issues even led to the downfall of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
*   **Measuring Burdens**
    It is challenging to measure the burdens experienced by people who never engage with a program or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. While take-up rates are helpful, assessing learning costs, for instance, requires a mixture of qualitative methods like focus groups and direct interviews with individuals and community organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. For those who do engage, simple, short user surveys at every step can provide valuable feedback on their experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. Research also shows that uncertainty creates a significant administrative burden, with people who don't receive a timely answer feeling as negatively as those whose applications are denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.
*   **Balancing Access and Privacy**
    When leveraging administrative data to shift burdens from the public to the state, privacy concerns arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. However, government agencies may sometimes "overvalue privacy relative to access" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>. People often expect the government to use data it already possesses to simplify processes ("you already have my data, why aren't you using it?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>, and may prioritize ease of access over strict privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>. A "do no harm" policy suggests that sharing data in ways that benefit citizens is more acceptable than using it to punish them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.
*   **Geographical Variations in Burden**
    The types of burdens faced by individuals can vary significantly by geographical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>. In rural areas, challenges might include lack of public transport or reliable private vehicles for accessing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. In urban settings, poor public infrastructure could be a different type of access issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.
*   **Digitalization and Inequality**
    Digitalization can either reduce or increase administrative burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. While it can enable automation, it can also exacerbate inequality due to unequal access to digital tools and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>. Older adults, in particular, may struggle with digital interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>. The key is to design an "easy road" for the majority while reallocating resources to support those facing digital challenges or unusual situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.

## Role of Behavioral Science
[[Challenges of government innovation | Behavioral science]] can contribute significantly to [[strategies_for_reducing_bureaucratic_frictions | reducing administrative burdens]] by:
*   **Evaluation:** Conducting AB testing or randomized control trials to determine the effectiveness of interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. This also involves documenting results, which governments often neglect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.
*   **Identifying Bottlenecks:** Using experimental designs to understand which types of costs (learning, compliance, psychological) are the primary barriers to participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>.
*   **Human-Centered Design:** Familiarizing government teams with tools like human-centered design and journey mapping to systematically improve processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.
*   **Emphasizing Evaluation:** Reminding practitioners that intuitive solutions may not always yield expected results, and rigorous evaluation is crucial for confirming success and avoiding unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

## Conclusion: Lessons Learned for Government
Addressing administrative burdens requires fundamental shifts in culture and practice, fostering [[citizencentered_governance_and_engagement | citizen-centered governance and engagement]] and [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | collaboration between governments and citizens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. Key lessons from US government efforts include:
*   **Cultivating a Citizen-Centric Culture:** Centering the public's experience of administrative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   **Building Capacity:** Agencies successful in burden reduction often have dedicated customer experience staff responsible for reviewing processes and incorporating public feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.
*   **Fostering Collaboration:** Redesigning processes often requires multiple agencies to work together, particularly for data sharing to simplify eligibility verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.
*   **Simplifying and Reviewing Processes:** Governments are adept at adding new rules but less so at reviewing existing systems for effectiveness. Regular review ensures processes remain "fit for purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Technology Wisely:** Technology, especially that which uses administrative data to shift burdens to the state, is a powerful enabler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. However, it must be applied thoughtfully to avoid introducing bias or imposing new burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

The overarching goal is to improve the quality of citizen interactions with government and strengthen public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

[[mission_oriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] involves adopting a more targeted approach to address long-term societal challenges, fostering new ways of collaborating, overcoming silos, and enabling both bottom-up experimentation and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. This approach is considered crucial for effective implementation and achieving transformative change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.

## Why Missions in Health and Cancer?

Cancer has become the leading cause of death in Western Europe, a problem expected to worsen as societies age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:05">[04:47:05]</a>. This inherently complex issue requires a structured way for diverse stakeholders to collaborate effectively within a reasonable timeframe and with clear goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:05">[04:58:05]</a>.

A [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented approach]] provides "directionality" by helping individuals and organizations overcome their limited scope regarding societal challenges and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:05">[05:21:05]</a>. Without a common direction, efforts might diverge, leading to suboptimal outcomes, such as expensive therapies without sustainable reimbursement models or inaccurate diagnostics due to data sharing restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:05">[05:34:05]</a>. This approach allows for forces to be joined, establishing a common direction and fostering shared understanding and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:05">[06:08:05]</a>. It also offers a framework for integrating systemic innovation aspects like technology, infrastructure, behavior, and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:05">[06:17:05]</a>. No single actor can solve these challenges alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:05">[06:27:05]</a>.

For the [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission approach]] to succeed in health, an explicit focus is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:05">[06:44:05]</a>. It is particularly useful when a field exhibits technological maturity, promises new scientific advancements, and possesses sufficient governance structures for health innovation, social systems, and complementary regulatory frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:05">[06:59:05]</a>. Cancer appears to be an area where these elements are already present, requiring a focused push to accelerate progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:05">[07:22:05]</a>.

### Opportunities in Personalized Medicine for Cancer Patients

Significant opportunities for personalized medicine in cancer lie where multi-sectoral knowledge, experience, and decision-making power converge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:05">[08:41:05]</a>. A shared mission simplifies collaboration and necessitates co-ownership of actions and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:05">[08:54:05]</a>. Collaborators must take responsibility within their areas of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:05">[09:19:05]</a>.

For example, in lung cancer, moving towards prevention and earlier detection among both risk groups and never-smokers could save many lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:05">[09:30:05]</a>. Achieving this requires collaboration beyond medical specialists and industry to include behavioral scientists, sociologists, and communication experts to address various challenges together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:05">[09:48:05]</a>.

The European Commission's focus on missions aims to counteract fragmentation in research, healthcare, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:05">[10:21:05]</a>. The goal is research that improves outcomes for high-risk individuals and patients, covering the complete continuum of prevention and therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:05">[10:42:05]</a>. Crucially, there's a recognized need for robust infrastructure, starting with comprehensive cancer centers and their networks to reach all patients and address inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:05">[11:12:05]</a>.

Prevention, currently underfunded (around 7% of typical cancer research budgets), has the potential to reduce the cancer burden by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:05">[11:35:05]</a>. Implementation research in this area is highly stressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:05">[11:53:05]</a>. Early detection holds enormous potential for both prevention and treatment by enabling earlier intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:05">[12:04:05]</a>. This approach benefits all patient types, regardless of histogenetic diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:05">[12:21:05]</a>.

The expansion of knowledge in cancer biology is both a challenge and an opportunity, necessitating better collaboration to analyze histogenetic groups and their diverse biological backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:05">[12:30:05]</a>. Stressing factors like tumor microenvironment and genomic instability is vital for understanding primary and acquired resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:05">[13:05:05]</a>. The focus on structuring clinical trials for the next generation of complex trials is also paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:05">[13:21:05]</a>.

Patient involvement in clinical trials and the sharing of comprehensive cancer centers is clearly emphasized by the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:05">[13:47:05]</a>. However, gaps remain in outcomes research, health economics, and health-related quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:05">[14:02:05]</a>.

## Key Elements for Success

### Stakeholder Engagement and Collaboration

Getting diverse stakeholders on board and committed to a mission requires:
*   The right people with engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:05">[17:09:05]</a>.
*   Collaboration, trust, and bringing actors together around a common vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:05">[17:13:05]</a>.
*   Including a broad mix of expertise at different levels, from operational work to advisory boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:05">[17:25:05]</a>.
*   Collaborating with different levels of the healthcare sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:05">[17:39:05]</a>.
*   Crucially, involving patients and their relatives at all steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:05">[17:48:05]</a>.
*   Consistent communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:05">[17:54:05]</a>.

Stakeholders, including academia, healthcare providers, patients, authorities, and industry, are largely committed and willing to take responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:05">[18:23:05]</a>. However, a shift in how these partners work together is needed, as they are not always accustomed to inter-sectoral collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:05">[19:09:05]</a>. While progress is being made in precision diagnostics, leveraging precision medicine, precision therapies, and broader aspects like prevention and early detection are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:05">[19:30:05]</a>.

For instance, in rare diseases or rare cancer cases, international collaboration is essential to ensure patients have access to detection technologies, drugs, and combination therapies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:05">[20:03:05]</a>. National precision medicine initiatives (over 34 in Europe) should collaborate more closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:05">[19:51:05]</a>.

### Building Trust and Overcoming Barriers

Public-private partnerships, such as the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) and the upcoming Innovative Health Initiative, demonstrate successful collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:05">[21:54:05]</a>. These initiatives, like the €10 billion IMI where half the budget comes from the European Commission and half from industry in-kind contributions (e.g., personnel), inherently push for collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:05">[22:13:05]</a>. Cancer-related projects within IMI, with budgets of almost €200 million, aim to catalyze oncology R&D, focusing on cancer biology, personalized medicine, disease management, and patient involvement in therapeutic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:05">[22:41:05]</a>.

Bringing together over 200 partners from academia, industry, SMEs, and philanthropy requires significant upfront discussion and work to align people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:05">[23:04:05]</a>. This includes:
*   **Clear Legal and IP Frameworks**: Establishing a framework to prevent perceptions of academics exploiting industry research or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:43:05">[23:43:05]</a>.
*   **Trust**: Hard work is needed to build trust through joint discussion and development of a shared vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:05">[24:20:05]</a>.
*   **Agreement on Objectives**: Full agreement and buy-in are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:05">[24:37:05]</a>.
*   **Clear Work Plan**: So every player knows their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:05">[24:45:05]</a>.
*   **Professional Alliance Management**: Large projects require dedicated professionals to manage alliances, as researchers alone cannot handle the complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:05">[24:55:05]</a>.

Unusual partners can sometimes be crucial. For example, identifying lack of transport as a barrier to hospital access during a patient journey mapping exercise highlighted the need to partner with transport or economy ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:05">[26:01:05]</a>. Similarly, prevention efforts require cooperation with education systems and schools to raise awareness and improve health literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:05">[27:12:05]</a>.

### Funding and Regulatory Aspects

Innovation agencies, like Vinnova, aim to provide better conditions for building partnerships across sectors, disciplines, and countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:05">[28:31:05]</a>. Supporting collaborative [[Emergent innovations from missionoriented projects | mission-driven initiatives]] is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:05">[28:49:05]</a>. Challenges include regulatory agencies' reluctance to partner with companies they regulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:05">[29:08:05]</a>. A neutral arena with neutral leadership can help overcome these difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:05">[29:29:05]</a>.

Vinnova's "Vision-Driven Health Program" (supporting the [[mission_oriented_innovation in cancer prevention and care | Vision Zero Cancer initiative]]) provides a framework for coordinating [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] and managing uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:05">[29:48:05]</a>. An agile approach allows for adaptability within consortiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:05">[30:10:05]</a>. While daunting for a public funder to invest without clear output specifications, this approach shows promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:05">[30:20:05]</a>.

Funding sustainability is a broader challenge, as innovation funding is often project-based and solution-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:05">[30:35:05]</a>. Funders need to collaborate more for a long-term funding perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43:05">[30:43:05]</a>. More work on health economics is needed to understand societal benefits and develop holistic, sustainable reimbursement models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:05">[30:49:05]</a>. The ability to work case-based and build demonstrators, rather than attempting to change the entire system at once, is also a valuable funding aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:05">[31:01:05]</a>.

### Data, Awareness, and Prioritization

Key elements for the "to-do list" also include:
*   **Data Management**: Ensuring data quality, standards, access, and protection, seeing cyber security as a support tool, not a limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:05">[33:13:05]</a>.
*   **Patient Input**: Integrating patient-reported experiences, outcomes, and incidents through online platforms for remote monitoring and information exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:05">[33:41:05]</a>.
*   **Integration of Information**: Including different stakeholders (e.g., social care, hospital, primary care) in the same information field remains a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:05">[34:03:05]</a>.
*   **Routine Integration of Genetics**: Bringing genetic information into routine healthcare, combining it with other available information, is a challenge that requires raising awareness and engaging patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:38:05">[34:38:05]</a>.
*   **Clear Prioritization**: Defining how to handle consequences of new knowledge (e.g., what services are offered and who pays after a high-risk genetic test result) before launching new activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:05">[35:09:05]</a>.

### Patient Involvement and Administrative Systems

While patient involvement is central, the challenge lies in *how* to achieve it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:05">[36:31:05]</a>. It requires reaching a representative group, providing opportunities, and allocating resources, as good intentions alone are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:42:05">[36:42:05]</a>. Bottom-up solutions are critical, as they can reveal unexpected issues like transport barriers to medical intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:43:05">[37:43:05]</a>.

Respecting and understanding administrative systems and leadership within healthcare, including administrative routines and annual budget cycles, is also vital for successful implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:05">[38:36:05]</a>.

### Collaborative Research and Infrastructure

Collaboration between research groups alone is not enough; sustainability requires a strong infrastructure background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:21:05">[39:21:05]</a>. This infrastructure becomes increasingly important with personalized medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:44:05">[39:44:05]</a>. Therefore, collaboration between integrated centers that combine research, education, and healthcare (Comprehensive Cancer Centers) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:52:05">[39:52:05]</a>. This model, tested successfully in Germany with consortia for long-term translational research, focuses on patient needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:05">[40:20:05]</a>.

### Transparency and Leadership

Transparency within the mission is key, ensuring all parties know what others are doing to avoid repetition and effectively use resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:36:05">[42:36:05]</a>. Lessons learned from the cancer mission, such as regarding transport or cooperation between primary and tertiary care, should be shared more broadly across healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:05">[43:11:05]</a>.

Strong leadership, effective communication, and transparency are crucial management pillars for successful collaboration within consortiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:56:05">[49:56:05]</a>.

### Lessons from COVID-19 and Future Outlook

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated Europe's capability to rapidly develop and scale new therapies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:08:05">[48:08:05]</a>. This serves as a powerful "demonstrator" that success is achievable, driven by a sense of urgency and willingness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:05">[48:31:05]</a>. The experience highlights that addressing complex problems requires professional management expertise for multiple stakeholders, not just individual experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:57:05">[48:57:05]</a>.

The pandemic has tested healthcare systems but also created a unique opportunity to redefine cancer care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:18:05">[54:18:05]</a>. As there's no going back to the past, it's an opportunity to collaboratively define a "new normal" for healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:28:05">[54:28:05]</a>. The alignment of different stakeholders moving in the same direction, coupled with strong examples of patient organization involvement and industry collaboration (e.g., [[genomic_medicine_sweden | Genomic Medicine Sweden]] and Comprehensive Cancer Centers), provides a positive outlook for personalized medicine in cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:22:05">[51:22:05]</a>.

[[MissionOriented Innovation]] is an approach to tackling complex societal challenges by aligning diverse stakeholders towards a common, long-term goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This approach emphasizes new ways of collaborating, overcoming silos, and fostering bottom-up experimentation alongside strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. It is particularly crucial for issues requiring a long-term perspective and the integration of systemic aspects like technology, infrastructure, behavior, and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

## Why Mission-Oriented Innovation?

Complex problems cannot be solved by a single actor or organization alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Individuals and organizations often have limited scope and mandates, leading to potentially sub-optimal solutions or fragmented efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. [[MissionOriented Innovation]] provides a framework to:
*   Set a common direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   Create shared understanding and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
*   Deal with uncertainty and adapt existing governance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   Address fragmentation in areas like research, healthcare, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.
*   Ensure that innovations, like precision cancer therapies or molecular diagnostics, are sustainable and accessible within public healthcare systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

The adoption of a more [[mission_oriented_innovation_in_public_sector | mission-oriented approach]] in public policy is seen as important for implementation tools and new ways of collaborating, aligning on long-term challenges, and allowing for bottom-up experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## [[Missionoriented Innovation in Healthcare]]

The [[missionoriented_innovation_in_healthcare | mission-oriented approach]] is particularly relevant in healthcare, where complex challenges like cancer require coordinated efforts. Cancer has become a leading cause of death in Western Europe, and its incidence is projected to rise due to aging populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Effectively tackling this complex problem requires multiple parties to work together with a clear goal within a reasonable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

### Application in Cancer
The [[MissionOriented Innovation | mission approach]] is implicit in many areas of health, such as antimicrobial resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. Making this focus explicit is useful when there is technological maturity, promise for new science, and sufficient governance and regulatory structures in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. Cancer is identified as an area where these elements are present, needing a concerted push to accelerate progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

### Opportunities for Personalized Medicine in Cancer
The biggest opportunities for personalized medicine in cancer lie in areas where multi-sectoral knowledge, experience, and decision-making power converge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. Key opportunities include:
*   **Collaboration and Co-ownership**: Joining forces around a mission fosters collaboration and co-ownership of actions, requiring all partners to contribute their specific competences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
*   **Prevention and Early Detection**: For example, in lung cancer, a joint mission could focus on prevention and earlier detection to save lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. This requires collaboration across diverse fields, including medical specialists, industry, behavioral sociologists, and communication experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
*   **Improving Patient Outcomes**: The European Commission aims to improve outcomes for high-risk individuals and patients, covering the entire continuum from prevention to therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure and Networks**: A robust infrastructure, including comprehensive cancer centers and their networks, is essential to reach all patients and address inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Fragmentation**: There is a recognized need to overcome fragmentation in research, healthcare, and education to focus on improving patient risk and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.
*   **Implementation Research**: Prevention, currently underfunded (around 7% of cancer research budgets), has the potential to reduce cancer problems by 40%, highlighting the importance of implementation research in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.
*   **Advanced Diagnostics and Therapies**: The mission should delve deeper into biological questions, expanding collaboration to analyze histogenetic groups and subgroups, addressing genomic instability, and understanding primary and acquired resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.
*   **Clinical Trials**: Moving towards more complex next-generation clinical trials is crucial for integrating innovations into healthcare systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Priorities

Several challenges and priorities need to be addressed to effectively implement [[MissionOriented Innovation]] in healthcare:

*   **Stakeholder Involvement**: Involving a broad mix of expertise at different levels, including patients and relatives, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>. Communication and clear language are key to engaging diverse stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>.
*   **Penta-Helix Collaboration**: Successful [[impact_and_strategic_orientation_of_innovation_missions | mission-oriented innovation]] requires collaboration among academia, healthcare, patients, authorities, and industry (the "penta-helix") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>. This often necessitates a change in working practices, as these partners may not be accustomed to collaborating closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>.
*   **Public-Private Partnerships**: Large-scale initiatives like the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) demonstrate the potential of public-private partnerships, where in-kind contributions (e.g., personnel) foster collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:02]</a>. Key elements for success include:
    *   Full agreement and buy-in on objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>.
    *   Clear legal and intellectual property (IP) frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>.
    *   Detailed work plans with defined roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>.
    *   Professional alliance management to oversee complex projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:00">[24:55:00]</a>.
    *   Building trust, especially between competing industry players, by demonstrating that the payoff of collaboration outweighs the risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>.
*   **Unusual Partners**: Sometimes, unexpected partners, such as transport ministries, are necessary to address gaps (e.g., patient access due to lack of transport) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>. For prevention, cooperation with education and schools is vital to raise health literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a>.
*   **Funding and Sustainability**: Innovation funding is often project-based and short-term. Funders need to collaborate more closely to ensure long-term funding perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>.
*   **Health Economics**: More work is needed on health economics to understand the societal benefits of [[MissionOriented Innovation]] and develop holistic, sustainable reimbursement models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>.
*   **Agile Approaches**: Adopting agile approaches allows for adaptability within consortia over time, which is crucial for handling uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>. Supporting case-based work and demonstrators rather than attempting to change the entire system at once can be more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>.
*   **Data Management**: Ensuring data quality, standards, access, and robust data protection/cybersecurity is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>. This includes patient-reported data (experience, outcomes, incidents) and platforms for online monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>.
*   **Integrating Genetics into Routine Care**: A significant challenge is integrating genetic information into the routine work of doctors, requiring new learning and awareness-raising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:38:00">[34:38:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritization of Services**: When identifying risks (e.g., through genetic testing), it is critical to have clear service offerings, reimbursement models, and follow-up plans for affected individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:00">[35:09:00]</a>.
*   **Patient Involvement**: While "involving patients" is a common goal, the practical methodology for achieving representative, resourced, and timely patient engagement remains a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>. Solutions should be bottom-up to capture the specific needs of citizens/patients, such as transport access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:43:00">[37:43:00]</a>.
*   **Administrative Systems**: Respecting and understanding administrative routines, leadership structures, and annual budget cycles within healthcare is essential for smooth implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:35:00">[38:35:00]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Knowledge Sharing**: Transparency within the mission ensures all parties know what others are doing, avoiding repetition and effectively using resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:36:00">[42:36:00]</a>. Lessons learned from one mission (e.g., cancer) should be shared broadly across other healthcare areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:13:00">[43:13:00]</a>.

## Moving Forward

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated Europe's ability to develop new therapies rapidly and scale them to a large population, highlighting the potential when there is a sense of urgency and willingness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:11:00">[48:11:00]</a>.

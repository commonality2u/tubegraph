The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global governance, revealing both the critical need for international collaboration and the [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges faced by governments]] within existing multilateral systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

### Initial Responses and Underlying Issues
Despite the global nature of the crisis, the initial response from many countries, including powerful and developed nations, was to turn inward with nationalistic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This led to unilateral measures like export bans on medical equipment, hindering the flow of essential goods and revealing the inefficiencies of purely national responses to an intrinsically global issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>.

A fundamental [[challenges_in_public_administration_and_systemic_reform | challenge]] highlighted is a clear mismatch between today's global realities, which demand cooperation, and the outdated legal and regulatory processes of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>. This pre-existing structural issue in global governance has been exacerbated by the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

### Core Challenges in Global Cooperation
Key factors preventing optimal levels of global cooperation include:
*   **Politics and Geopolitics** Governments are often reluctant to grant international organizations enforcement or inspection powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>. Political issues can also prevent reforms in international bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:44:00">[25:44:00]</a>.
*   **Financing** Many international organizations face chronic underfunding, limiting their capacity to act effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:14:00">[25:14:00]</a>. For example, the COVAX initiative, aimed at universal vaccine access, is challenged by insufficient funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>.
*   **Capacity** Developing countries often lack the resources and capacity to implement international obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:00">[25:22:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide** A significant [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_green_governance | challenge]] is the lack of interoperability between data and digital technologies used by different countries, making it difficult to rely on common data sets for international cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:00">[27:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:00">[27:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:20:00">[27:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:25:00">[27:25:00]</a>. This also affects monitoring supply chains using technologies like blockchain if different systems are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:00">[29:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:18:00">[29:18:00]</a>.

### Criticisms of Traditional Multilateralism
International organizations are frequently criticized as distant bureaucracies and slow political machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[46:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:49:00">[46:49:00]</a>. These criticisms were amplified during COVID-19, which put immense pressure on them to deliver rapid solutions despite difficulties in organizing international meetings due to lockdowns and travel restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:53:00">[46:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:00:00">[47:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:13:00">[47:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:18:00">[47:18:00]</a>.

Pre-existing [[challenges_and_solutions_in_climate_policy_governance | challenges]] faced by international organizations include struggles to:
*   Remain inclusive and consult efficiently with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:46:00">[47:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:49:00">[47:49:00]</a>.
*   Accurately calculate their impact due to lack of mandate and methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:54:00">[47:54:00]</a>.
*   Coordinate with other bodies having parallel mandates to ensure coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:59:00">[47:59:00]</a>.

The traditional model of purely governmental cooperation is becoming outdated as a diverse set of actors, including multinational companies, NGOs, and virtual interest groups, play increasing roles alongside governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:28:00">[57:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:30:00">[57:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:35:00">[57:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:38:00">[57:38:00]</a>. Governments are increasingly dependent on non-state actors for data and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:00:00">[58:00:00]</a>.

### Globalization and Trade
The globalization of goods was already affected after the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. The pandemic reinforced trends towards unilateralism and outright conflict between nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. The WTO, a key body for global trade, has faced criticism regarding export restrictions, and negotiations have been deadlocked for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:55:00">[27:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:00">[28:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:00">[28:37:00]</a>. The initial nationalistic responses led to significant drawbacks for businesses, impacting global supply chains, consumption, and the movement of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:58:00">[31:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:04:00">[32:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:12:00">[32:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:15:00">[32:15:00]</a>.

### The Nation-State's Continued Relevance
Despite global [[challenges_and_strategies_for_global_collaboration | challenges]] like environment, refugees, and pandemics, the notion of the country and national territory is not outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:45:00">[55:45:00]</a>. The rise of populism and nationalism indicates that most people remain attached to their countries, and no alternative organizing model has replaced the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:02:00">[56:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:05:00">[56:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:08:00">[56:08:00]</a>. While other organizing models based on interests (e.g., multinational companies, NGOs, virtual groups) exist, governments remain central to decision-making, increasingly working alongside these diverse groups in multi-stakeholder partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:39:00">[56:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:41:00">[56:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:43:00">[56:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:47:00">[56:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:53:00">[56:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:58:00">[56:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:00:00">[57:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:10:00">[57:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:17:00">[57:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:20:00">[57:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:22:00">[57:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:23:00">[57:23:00]</a>.

Gender-based violence (GBV) represents a global pandemic that existed even before the recent health crisis, with estimates indicating over one-third of women experience some form of violence in their lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The OECD considers GBV a profound priority for its gender equality agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, GBV has been exacerbated worldwide, with reports from many OECD and partner countries showing a significant increase in rates, especially during lockdowns when women and girls were confined with abusers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This rise in violence, sometimes referred to as a "shadow pandemic" by UN Women, is particularly difficult to address because victims may fear seeking help due to their perpetrator, concerns about family difficulties, believing services are closed, or fear of getting sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for governments to plan more strategically and act proactively on GBV, especially during times of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## The Need for [[wholeofgovernment_approaches_to_addressing_genderbased_violence | Whole-of-Government Approaches]]

No single agency can effectively address the complex issue of GBV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. A [[wholeofgovernment_approaches_to_addressing_genderbased_violence | whole-of-government approach]] is crucial, alongside a society-wide effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This requires political will from the highest levels, internal activism, and advocacy from gender departments within governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. The OECD's technical advisory group on GBV is finalizing a framework to strengthen governance and survivor-centered approaches, focusing on three pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>:
1.  A systems approach with strong intersectional [[collaborative_governance_and_breaking_silos_in_mission_implementation | coordination]] and holistic legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
2.  Cultural change for survivor-centric responses and access to justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
3.  Improved accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

### Swiss National Task Force
Switzerland quickly established a national task force on violence, GBV, and COVID in March 2020, as soon as a semi-lockdown was announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Its primary goals were to ensure:
*   Counseling centers and shelters continued providing services and had the means to function while respecting health measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
*   Police remained available for domestic violence cases, intervening and enforcing restraining orders, even removing violent persons from homes if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
*   Threats to children were reported to authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
The aim was to ensure victims had access to existing support structures across all regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. A major challenge for Switzerland, as a federal state, was ensuring commitment and functionality of local structures at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

Key actions taken by the task force included:
*   **Monitoring the situation**: Establishing a short-term information flow to collect weekly data from police, victim support services, shelters, and other stakeholders across urban and rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
*   **Public Information Campaigns**: Launching poster campaigns with the help of professional organizations (groceries, pharmacies, garden centers) to inform the public that domestic violence remained a priority and help was available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. This fostered a sense of solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   **Financial Support**: Increasing financial support to helplines due to increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   **Data Collection**: While phone calls increased, a general increase in police-reported domestic violence cases was not observed, highlighting the need for more robust, sound, and reliable data for effective policy decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

This task force, built upon a pre-existing committee, allowed for weekly meetings to monitor the situation and address issues like shelter capacity or staff sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. The success was attributed to increased [[coordination_between_national_and_local_governments | coordination]] and [[collaborative_governance_and_breaking_silos_in_mission_implementation | collaboration]] between federal and canton levels, and across different services responsible for fighting domestic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

### Family Justice Centers
The Family Justice Center (FJC) model, originated in the US and introduced in Europe years ago, brings professionals from different organizations (police, justice, social services, health) to work together under one roof to support GBV survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. This model has proven very effective, saving lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.

*   **Adaptability during Crisis**: In Antwerp, Belgium, the FJC rapidly shifted to a central and virtual coordination role for domestic violence and child abuse situations during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. Their pre-existing multi-disciplinary approach enabled a quick transition to online consultations and the arrangement of alternative housing options, such as using vacant hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
*   **Increased Reporting**: A survey in Belgium showed that areas with FJCs experienced an increase in reported cases of violence, while areas without FJCs saw a decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. This indicates that well-established, cooperative models can maintain reporting even during lockdowns when victims might otherwise be silenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.
*   [[international_collaboration_during_crises | International collaboration]]: Cooperation with organizations like the Alliance for Hope International in the US allowed for the rapid sharing of experiences and the creation of practical guidelines for professionals on how to work with survivors in new ways (e.g., online consultations, "sidewalk conversations" or outdoor meetings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.

### Chile's Contingency Plan
Chile's government adopted a contingency plan early in the pandemic, benefiting from time to observe what was happening in other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. The plan aimed to secure service continuity and strengthen GBV response capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.

Key measures included:
*   **Service Continuity**: Ensuring 109 GBV day centers and 45 shelters operated at full capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.
*   **Increased Capacity**: Addressing a 250% increase in hotline calls by increasing resources, adding shifts, and enabling remote appointments for day centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.
*   **[[coordination_between_national_and_local_governments | Coordination]]**: Immediately activating the GBV coordination circuit, involving health providers, police, and public prosecutor's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. Essential services were declared, and protection measures like restraining orders were automatically extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.
*   **Public Awareness**: Widespread communication via police and [[role_of_media_and_public_awareness_in_tackling_genderbased_violence | media]] to ensure women knew they would not face sanctions for violating curfew or quarantine if seeking help for GBV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. GBV helpline information was included in daily national TV COVID sanitary reports and news segments covering GBV cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.
*   **Innovation and New Channels**: Developing silent helplines, a WhatsApp line, an online website, and an alliance with pharmacies to provide information (though direct assistance through pharmacies proved challenging due to training requirements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. Future plans include SMS capabilities for hotlines to reach those without smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.
*   **Targeted Messaging**: Identifying high-risk groups and sending specific messages and guidelines through key actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.
*   **[[collaborative_governance_and_breaking_silos_in_mission_implementation | Society-Wide Approach]]**: Forming a Council of Women on COVID with congresswomen and civil society to develop measures addressing the pandemic's differentiated [[impact_of_covid19_on_genderbased_violence | impact on women]] across protection, economic reactivation, and care responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. Partnerships with the state bank (Banco Estado) to provide GBV prevention information in local banking shops and with private sector business associations to train employers on detection and prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Future Opportunities
The pandemic highlighted bottlenecks in existing response systems and spurred urgent [[innovations_in_supporting_survivors_of_violence_during_the_pandemic | innovations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Key lessons and future directions include:

*   **Importance of Data**: Robust, reliable data is crucial to identify where efforts are needed, which groups to target, and to develop effective measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.
*   **[[wholeofgovernment_approaches_to_addressing_genderbased_violence | Whole-of-Society Approach]]**: GBV must be addressed as a society-wide issue, not solely by gender departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. This includes the fundamental role of [[role_of_media_and_public_awareness_in_tackling_genderbased_violence | media]], civil society, and the private sector in bringing attention and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>.
*   **[[coordination_between_national_and_local_governments | Coordination and Collaboration]]**: Establishing coordination mechanisms in normal times allows for rapid and effective scaling during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This includes coordination across different services (police, shelters, counseling) and all levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **Capacity and Resources**: Sufficient capacity and resources for service providers are essential, as limited capacity can impede effective, survivor-centered responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Strategies**: National, comprehensive strategies are needed to guide responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>.
*   **Evaluation and Continuous Learning**: Regular evaluation helps understand what worked and what didn't, allowing for necessary adaptations and improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. This includes collecting and sharing interesting practices developed at the local level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>.
*   **[[innovations_in_supporting_survivors_of_violence_during_the_pandemic | Innovation]] and Flexibility**: Creativity and new ways of working are necessary to deliver services under changed circumstances, leveraging technology and new tools to reach survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.
*   **Survivor-Centered Approaches**: Governments and professionals must actively listen to survivors and incorporate their experiences into service design and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. Services should be designed for survivors, with them at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. This includes making all services accessible to diverse groups of women, including those with disabilities and migrant women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.
*   **Clear Political Will**: Governments must publicly declare zero tolerance for domestic violence and emphasize that support services remain open, even making exceptions for victims during curfews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   **Engaging Men and Boys**: Future efforts should strengthen work engaging men and boys in preventing GBV, including developing platforms for online courses on positive masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>.

The experience of the pandemic, while challenging, has provided opportunities to rethink and transform how governments approach the GBV challenge for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

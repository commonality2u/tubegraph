The "Government After Shock" initiative, supported by the OECD, aims to facilitate global learning and reflection on governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The central questions posed are: what should be left behind from this system shock, what should be kept, and what should be done differently for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>? This discussion explores [[postpandemic_government_challenges_and_strategies | postpandemic government challenges and strategies]] and the need for governments to be resilient and adaptive in the face of future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

## Government Responses to COVID-19

Representatives from the UAE, Montenegro, Estonia, and Indonesia shared their initial [[Resilience and innovation in pandemic response | pandemic response strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>:

*   **United Arab Emirates (UAE)**: The UAE's response was characterized by speed and agility, prioritizing health and food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This involved rallying healthcare, adopting early and massive testing, and making heavy investments in sterilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Existing food security strategies, including a strong storage capacity initiated in 2017, proved beneficial, allowing the UAE to provide food aid to almost 120 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The government also invested heavily in science and technology, including vaccinations and stem cell research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. A core message was business continuity, with economic stimulus packages and seamless migration to online services and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Indonesia**: Facing a large and diverse population, Indonesia's initial challenge was monitoring the virus's movement without a unified data system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Within a month, they developed a platform, "Fighting Against COVID-19," to integrate data from over 500 districts and cities across 34 provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This platform enabled real-time zoning and mapping, driving public communication twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The crisis also highlighted a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), leading to the surprising discovery of local polyester raw materials and the development of high-standard domestic PPE production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.
*   **Estonia**: Estonia's response was "responsive," tackling the situation iteratively with a focus on what worked best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Their digital infrastructure played a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. A key insight was the need for better data maturity and governance to ensure decisions were data-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. The crisis also reinforced the importance of community involvement, with the tech community spontaneously offering help through hackathons to build digital solutions like public maps and stock management systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
*   **Montenegro**: The Montenegrin government mobilized all policy departments, ensuring every sector took ownership in the response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Focus was on preventing community transmission through rapid case isolation, care, and contact quarantining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. A major effort was made to ensure continuity of public services through digital channels, providing relevant information via national portals, mobile apps, and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. This involved rapid adjustments to internal ICT procedures and legal frameworks to support remote work and e-services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

## Learning from the Crisis: Unexpected Insights

Several governments gained unexpected insights during the pandemic:

*   **Adaptability of Youth**: The UAE observed that children and the younger generation adapted most seamlessly to remote schooling and new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. This highlighted their [[Resilience and innovation in pandemic response | resilience]] and adaptability to change, offering lessons for adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
*   **Data Maturity**: Estonia realized the need to improve data integrity, interpretation, and flow within the government, leading to a "crash course" in data governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Community and Private Sector Engagement**: Estonia was surprised by the eagerness of its tech community to volunteer and develop solutions, revealing that the government's readiness to collaborate was the bottleneck, not a lack of external resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
*   **Domestic Production Capabilities**: Indonesia discovered its strong textile industry could produce high-standard PPE domestically, reducing reliance on imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. This highlighted unexpected self-reliance and the potential for humanitarian aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

## Post-Crisis Strategies for the "New Normal"

Governments are strategizing to institutionalize the positive changes brought about by the crisis, aiming for [[Public sector transformation postcrisis | public sector transformation postcrisis]] and [[Preparing governments for future challenges | preparing governments for future challenges]].

### Key Areas for Institutionalization:

*   **Remote Work and Productivity Measurement**: While remote work is an obvious "new normal," the challenge remains how to effectively measure staff productivity when working from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
*   **Digital Services and Infrastructure**: The UAE's long-term investment in digital services allowed for a smooth migration to online platforms during lockdown, leading to a proposal to shut down 50% of physical customer care centers within two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. This demonstrates a commitment to embed digital-first approaches permanently.
*   **Anticipation and Proactiveness**: Investing in key areas *before* a crisis hits, as the UAE did with smart education and digital services, yielded significant benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. The UAE even announced a digital school platform for refugees, extending the benefits beyond its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.
*   **Agility in Regulation and Policy**: The crisis necessitated a "fast track" approach to policymaking. There's a hope that this agile, extreme, and rapid approach will become a structured framework, with distinct paths for urgent high-priority issues versus normal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. The UAE plans to announce its agile framework to make this mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
*   **Data Governance and Literacy**: Estonia aims to cement improvements in data literacy, data flows, and data governance as proper platforms for future government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.
*   **[[Innovation in response to crisis | Innovation in response to crisis]]**: The pandemic forced many governments to rapidly adopt digital solutions, providing a "crash course" in digital transformation overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. This experience demonstrates that such transformations are possible, potentially accelerating future [[Public sector transformation postcrisis | public sector transformation postcrisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.
*   **[[The economic impact of the pandemic and recovery strategies | Economic Recovery Strategies]]**: Indonesia developed a five-step strategy for the new normal, understanding that health problems lead to economic and social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. This includes preconditioning society, prioritizing economic activities with low transmission risk, enabling local timing for openings, coordinating between central and local governments, and continuous monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.
*   **Strengthening Health Systems**: Indonesia is investing in its health systems as part of the Global Health Security Agenda, building capacity to detect, prevent, and respond to emerging infectious diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. This includes expanding laboratory networks for detection and supporting drug and vaccine development, reducing dependence on imported pharmaceutical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

While there's optimism for a "new normal," challenges remain:

*   **Institutionalization of Change**: Changes brought by the crisis will not last unless consciously worked upon, as the crisis may not have been "long enough" to embed them permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. This requires strong [[Leadership and organizational readiness for future challenges | leadership and organizational readiness for future challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.
*   **Procurement Reform**: Montenegro highlighted that its public procurement process was too long and inadequate for rapid crisis response, emphasizing the urgent need for e-procurement procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   **[[Systems thinking in government during crises | Fragmented Responses]]**: Montenegro noted the absence of a comprehensive strategy paper for similar situations, leading to a fragmented crisis response instead of coordinated action across sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   **Mental Health and Workforce Well-being**: The crisis brought into sharp focus the importance of workforce and mental health, with social distancing affecting human connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

## The Role of Government Post-COVID-19

When asked about the future role of government:
*   Estonia, Montenegro, and Indonesia anticipate an **increase** in the government's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   The UAE expects a **decrease in size but an increase in importance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.

Many governments are actively working on [[Preparing governments for future challenges | future preparedness]]:
*   The UAE developed a post-COVID strategy as early as March, focusing on identifying opportunities in all sectors and investing in future-oriented initiatives, such as continuing space missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.
*   Indonesia established a committee with two task forces: one for COVID-19 control and another for the National Recovery Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

The collective experience emphasizes the need for collaboration, flexibility, inclusion, and accountability, which the crisis should accelerate into lasting changes for public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

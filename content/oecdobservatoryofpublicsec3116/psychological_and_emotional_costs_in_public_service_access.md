[[administrative_burdens_in_citizengovernment_interactions | Administrative burdens]] encompass the negative experiences people have when interacting with government services, often categorized into learning, compliance, and psychological costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Psychological costs are a crucial component of this framework, highlighting the emotional and mental toll that bureaucratic obstacles can impose on individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Defining Psychological Costs

Psychological costs refer to the "stress, loss of autonomy, frustration, even fear" that individuals can experience when navigating public processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

Historically, discussions around the emotional impact of government interactions often focused primarily on "stigma," particularly concerning policies targeted at low-income individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. However, the concept of psychological costs broadens this understanding to include a wider range of negative emotions and mental states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Impact on Trust in Government

A significant implication of [[reducing_psychological_costs_in_government_services | psychological costs]] is their influence on the level of trust citizens have in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. While a single negative experience may not transform trust, an accumulation of positive or negative experiences can have a significant impact on how people perceive government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>. Improving customer experience and [[reducing_psychological_costs_in_government_services | administrative burdens]] can contribute to improving this trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

## Examples of Psychological Burdens

*   **Food Stamps during the Pandemic**: A single mother attempting to access the food stamp program during the pandemic spent an hour downloading documents and health insurance forms, only to find she couldn't process them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This highlights the frustration and stress caused by complex digital interfaces and bureaucratic hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Medicaid Renewal in Tennessee**: Approximately 200,000 children in Tennessee lost health insurance coverage due to changes in renewal forms that were not communicated to beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. One case involved a woman whose child was recovering from cancer, only discovering the loss of coverage upon arriving at a doctor's office, causing significant "fear, stress, and anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty**: A study in California found that uncertainty creates a large [[administrative_burdens_in_citizengovernment_interactions | administrative burden]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>. People who did not receive a benefit or those who did not find out the answer to their application status tended to report more negative experiences, similar to those who were denied the benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>. This indicates that "leaving people waiting for a long period of time where they don't know where they are" generates a sense of [[administrative_burdens_in_citizengovernment_interactions | administrative burden]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.
*   **Immigrant Communities**: In the US, there is significant fear within undocumented and even legal immigrant communities that affects their access to government benefits and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.

## Inequality and Psychological Burdens

[[Impact of Inequality on Access to Government Services | Inequality]] often exacerbates [[reducing_psychological_costs_in_government_services | psychological costs]]. People who are most in need of help are often the least well-equipped to navigate complicated systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. This includes individuals facing language barriers, those who are ill, or those with cognitive or intellectual disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Furthermore, people tend to perform less well under conditions of scarcity, stress, or poor health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. These are often the same populations who require access to these complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## Measuring Psychological Costs

Measuring [[reducing_psychological_costs_in_government_services | psychological costs]], especially for individuals who never initiate contact with a service, is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. However, for those who do engage, various methods can be employed:

*   **Qualitative Methods**: Focus groups and interviews with community organizations and individuals can provide insights into people's experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>.
*   **User Surveys**: Implementing short, one or two-question surveys at various stages of a process (e.g., via text or pop-ups) can gauge user experience and identify patterns of psychological burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. A specific, short measure has been developed for this purpose, available in the journal "Behavioral Public Administration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

## Strategies for Reduction

[[Reducing psychological costs in government services | Reducing psychological costs]] often involves broader strategies aimed at minimizing [[administrative_burdens_in_citizengovernment_interactions | administrative burdens]]:

*   **Human-Centered Design**: Applying human-centered design principles to review and design government processes can lead to more user-friendly interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>.
*   **Automation and Data Leverage**: The "gold standard" for reducing burden is automation, which shifts burdens from individuals to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. Leveraging [[administrative_burdens_in_citizengovernment_interactions | administrative data]] to automatically verify eligibility, as seen in Medicaid auto-renewal, significantly reduces compliance and psychological burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
    *   **Caveat on Automation**: While technology can be a great enabler, blind faith in automation can introduce bias and lead to worse outcomes, as seen in cases like Australia and the Netherlands where algorithmic checks for fraud caused significant harm and increased burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
    *   **Privacy Concerns**: Balancing automation with privacy is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. While government agencies may sometimes overvalue privacy relative to access, the principle of "do no harm" suggests sharing data to benefit citizens is intuitive, but sharing it for punitive purposes is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Customer Experience Teams**: Agencies that successfully reduce burden often have dedicated staff whose primary job is to review processes, consider public experience, and revise them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **[[behavioral_insights_in_public_administration | Behavioral Science]]**: Can contribute by conducting randomized control trials to test interventions, documenting results, and familiarizing government staff with human-centered design and journey mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>. It also emphasizes the importance of rigorous evaluation, as intuitive solutions may not always produce the desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>.

## Future Research

There is a clear need for more research specifically on [[reducing_psychological_costs_in_government_services | psychological costs]], particularly empirical studies and qualitative interviews to understand the full spectrum of these barriers beyond just stigma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>.

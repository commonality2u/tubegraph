It highlights the experiences of IP Australia, a government agency that had already embarked on a significant innovation journey before the COVID-19 crisis, demonstrating how prior investment in technology, culture, and processes can provide a robust foundation for [[adaptive innovation]] during times of upheaval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Introduction to the Public Sector Innovation Webinar

This webinar, part of Innovation Month 2024, focused on making innovative public sector organizations and featured special guest Michael Troigir from IP Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The event was recorded and made available on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Innovation Month Online Australia's Public Sector Innovation Network adopted the theme "delivering differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) at the OECD focuses on uncovering what's next, embedding promising practices, and providing trusted advice to governments on consistent approaches to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. OPSI recently released a mini-trends report on [[innovative_government_responses_to_the_crisis | innovative COVID-19 responses]] by governments worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The current crisis has "unleashed and unlocked a huge amount of innovation," with OPSI tracking over 400 [[public_sector_innovation_in_response_to_covid19 | innovative initiatives and case studies]] in its innovative responses tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. A key question is how to help organizations innovate when the need is less obvious, ensuring innovation is standard practice for when the unexpected occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## IP Australia's Innovation Journey

IP Australia is the Australian government agency responsible for issuing intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, designs, and plant breeders' rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. It also promotes awareness of IP rights as part of Australia's [[role_of_innovation_ecosystems_during_a_crisis | innovation ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. A significant factor in IP Australia's innovation journey is its status as a cost-recovered agency, funding its operations and investments through fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This financial independence is a key enabler of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

The agency's innovation journey began significantly around eight years prior, under the leadership of Michael's predecessor, Patricia Kelly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. A capability review highlighted areas for cultural improvement and increased embrace of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Key milestones included:
*   **Leadership Commitment**: The executive team championed innovation, providing crucial momentum from the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Strategic Direction**: A clear "Roadmap to 2030" was established and incorporated into annual corporate plans, setting ambitious goals that necessitated risk-taking and leaps in approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Budget**: A small percentage (less than 1%) of the annual budget was explicitly dedicated to experimentation, technology, and ideas, accepting that some initiatives might fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Office of the Chief Economist**: Established in 2012, this office built economic expertise and data analysis, providing a better structure for decision-making and pushing innovation discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. This also built confidence for the agency to proactively define what innovation meant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Staff Engagement**: The agency encouraged staff to develop ideas, fostering a multi-directional approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This allowed highly skilled people, particularly in STEM fields, to unleash their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## Key Innovations and Their Impact

IP Australia has implemented several significant innovations:
*   **Trademark Search**: Introduced in February 2017, this tool combined image searching and machine learning to simplify trademark searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Users could upload logos instead of using text descriptions, providing instantaneous results from over 400,000 images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. This drastically reduced the chance of application rejections, saving businesses time and providing an easier user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. It resulted in a 54% reduction in calls related to trademark searching at their call center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   **Trademark Assist**: Launched in 2018, this interactive tool educates and assists trademark applicants through the initial stages of the application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. It uses machine learning to tailor information and help applicants submit high-quality applications, leading to increased successful applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Futures Program**: This internal program allocates funds for experimentation, particularly in AI and machine learning, to apply these technologies to internal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Internal Quality Assurance System**: Less "sexy" but equally important, changes were made to the internal quality assurance system, ranging from compliance to the quality of examination reports. This complex undertaking was driven by a passion for improvement and involved significant change management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

Many of these innovations involved leveraging external expertise through commercial partnerships, demonstrating that not all innovations are internally generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

## Managing Risk and Collaboration

IP Australia adopted an [[understanding_adaptive_innovation | agile methodology]] for developing prototypes and iterating ideas, helping them "fail fast" and address business concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. Despite engaging in significant IT transformations that led external advisors to deem them "maxed out on risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>, their methodology, leadership's appetite for risk, and backing of experts helped them navigate these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

Collaboration with the private sector was crucial, especially when the outcomes were not fully defined from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. Success hinged on long-term trust, strong personal working relationships, and viewing private sector partners as true collaborators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

## [[Adaptive innovation in public services | Adapting to Crisis with Innovation]]: The COVID-19 Experience

IP Australia's prior investments in flexible workplace arrangements and IT infrastructure proved invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. Key elements that facilitated their smooth transition included:
*   **Activity-Based Working**: The agency had recently completed a project to ensure physical workspaces suited different types of work, with all staff equipped with laptops and good Wi-Fi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
*   **Flexible Workplace Policies**: Staff had the flexibility to work remotely from almost anywhere with connectivity, provided it suited their job requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
*   **Cultural Change**: A strong change management piece discouraged managers from insisting on physical presence and encouraged staff to embrace new infrastructure opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.
*   **Rapid Scaling of Remote Work**: The organization rapidly scaled from 100 remote workers to 1,000 in just one week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. This was possible because they were already used to virtual teams and managers were accustomed to managing remote teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>.

This preparedness, thanks to decisions made years earlier, meant IP Australia was well-placed to navigate the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

## [[Crisis management and future preparedness | Crisis Management and Future Preparedness]]

A key lesson from the crisis is the confidence that the organization "can do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. IP Australia had a national pandemic response plan as part of its business continuity process, which it implemented to the letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. They also had a bit of luck, having conducted pandemic exercises shortly before COVID-19 hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

The experience reinforces the importance of [[systemic_approaches_during_covid19_crisis | scenario planning]] and strategic risk management. The pandemic has shown that agencies should be less dismissive of preparing for unlikely catastrophic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.

## Challenges and Continuous Improvement

Key challenges and areas for continuous improvement include:
*   **Communicating Complex Ideas**: Technical staff need strategies to explain complex innovative ideas to non-technical staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>. This requires layered communication, starting from the core strategic vision and providing examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   **Pace of Change**: While IP Australia initially experienced significant transformational change, the organization recognized the need to calibrate the pace to avoid "change exhaustion" and sustain innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. They shifted focus to more project-driven, enhanced, or [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.
*   **Formalizing Learning from Failures**: While acknowledging failures and working to fix problems, IP Australia aims to incorporate more formal evaluation and lesson-learning routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>.
*   **Risk Culture Maturity**: Building people's confidence in risk and how to deal with it across all levels of the organization is an ongoing responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>.
*   **Refreshing Strategic Roadmap**: The "Roadmap to 2030" needs constant revisiting to ensure the organization remains vigilant about future scenarios and avoids settling into a comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.

## Advice for Fostering Innovation

For organizations embarking on an innovation journey, particularly in a bureaucratic setting, key advice includes:
*   **Identify Opportunities within Your Work**: Even without top-down commitment, individuals can identify ways to improve processes or achieve quantum leaps in outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>.
*   **Engage Customers and Stakeholders**: Involving customers and showing examples of where innovation has been done elsewhere can help manage internal risk averseness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.
*   **Embrace Agile and Experimentation**: Utilize methodologies that allow for quick prototyping, testing, and iterating ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.
*   **Start with Adaptive Innovation**: For organizations without a strong innovation culture, beginning with [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]] (enhancements and adaptations) can build comfort and confidence before tackling more transformative initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.
*   **Align with Strategic Objectives**: Frame proposed innovations within the context of the organization's strategic objectives and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>.
*   **Be Prepared to "Fail Fast"**: Don't oversell an innovation. Be open to evaluation, accept when something isn't working, and learn lessons from failures to apply elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.
*   **Strong Communication and Evidence-Base**: Good communication skills are vital to articulate ideas and gain buy-in. Support proposals with evidence, ideally from engaging with customers and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.
*   **Patience and Understanding**: Recognize that organizational change and innovation takes time. People move at different paces, and it's not a uniform process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>.
*   **Common Touchstone**: A clear strategic roadmap provides a common touchstone that helps steer the organization, even when there are disagreements on pace or risk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>. This clarity is crucial, as innovation often takes a backseat to clearer, more measurable objectives unless its importance is firmly understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>.

Ultimately, sustained commitment and maintaining momentum across changes in [[leadership_and_innovation_during_covid19 | leadership]] are crucial for an organization's innovation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a>.

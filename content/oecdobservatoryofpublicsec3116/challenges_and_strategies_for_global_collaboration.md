For a long time, public sector innovation research focused on governments' capacity to innovate within their established territories and jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, in a continuously changing world where problems have shifted from complicated to complex, and from local to global, governments are increasingly required to unite and devise new solutions for shared issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This highlights the need for [[government_collaboration_to_tackle_global_challenges | government collaboration to tackle global challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## The Imperative for Cross-Border Innovation

The COVID-19 crisis demonstrated governments' ability to innovate rapidly, unleashing a torrent of [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_innovation | innovation]] at an unprecedented pace and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Yet, the crisis also exposed significant shortcomings and reinforced pre-existing vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. At the national level, a lack of preparedness to tackle global challenges was evident, with only half of OECD countries possessing dedicated institutions for identifying novel, unforeseen, or complex crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Globally, the pandemic underscored how increased interconnectedness makes the world more vulnerable to common threats and revealed weaknesses in international cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Major challenges such as COVID-19, climate change, digitalization, and migration are not confined by jurisdictional borders; they necessitate collective action across countries and policy fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Effectively addressing these [[government_collaboration_to_tackle_global_challenges | global challenges]] is crucial for reinforcing democracy and public trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | Innovation]] is a key tool in this effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Challenges to Cross-Border Collaboration

Despite the clear need, government [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | innovation]] efforts are largely confined to national or local borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The reasons for this include:

*   **Lack of Recognition/Communication** Cross-border work is often not widely discussed or understood, and successful instances are difficult to portray publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The term "cross-border" or "transnational" may lack immediate appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **"No Permission" Syndrome** Public sector employees often feel they lack explicit permission to engage in cross-border initiatives, fearing it deviates from their key performance indicators (KPIs) or core jurisdictional responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   **Cultural Differences** Understanding the culture and language of counterparts is a significant barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. Even within a single country, cultural differences between states can hinder collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. Geographic proximity often indicates cultural proximity, making collaboration with distant countries more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   **Tribalism and Silos** There's a tendency for agencies and departments to believe their work is paramount, making [[challenges_and_success_factors_in_crossborder_collaboration | cross-sectoral work]] difficult to justify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
*   **Polarizing Effects of Globalization** Ironically, instruments of globalization like social media, free trade, and technological advancements, which were expected to foster greater connection, are sometimes driving societies apart through polarization and a focus on local rather than international news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Funding Metrics** Treasury funding metrics can present a barrier where benefits generated on both sides of a border are "netted off," discouraging co-investment even when it would lead to more efficient outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.
*   **National Level Resistance** Regional efforts, like the Quarken Council, have experienced resistance or a lack of interest from national governments, requiring creativity to secure support (e.g., leveraging EU interest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Change** It is often easier to continue existing ways of doing things alone rather than incurring the transaction costs of reaching out and learning new approaches through collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.

## Strategies for Success

To overcome these [[challenges_and_success_factors_in_crossborder_collaboration | challenges]], several strategies are proposed:

*   **Building Trust and Relationships** This is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. It requires an investment in personal connections with counterparts, ideally before an acute issue arises, making future collaboration smoother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. Relationships take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
*   **Clear Common Goals** Define a concrete or limited problem or area for collaboration at the outset. Knowing where you want to go is essential for getting results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
*   **Formalized Arrangements** While personal relationships are crucial, more formalized arrangements, such as the European Group for Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) established by the Quarken Council, can make it easier to be a recognized partner and secure financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. The EU membership has also facilitated collaboration and funding for Sweden and Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Strategic Financing** Public banks and international financial organizations (IFOs) can be effective at "crowding in" money by providing a safe investment foundation for private sector participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Local Knowledge** The people living and working at the border often already possess solutions or ideas, having navigated challenges over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
*   **Diverse Dialogue and Information Exchange** Collaboration requires dialogue with a diverse set of actors, including companies, NGOs, and traditional international organizations, as they all hold vital information about the impacts of policies and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>.
*   **Investing in Public Servant Skills**
    *   **Permission:** Senior leaders must grant permission for public servants to engage in cross-border learning and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.
    *   **Exposure:** Bring public servants to the border to sit with communities experiencing issues, fostering a problem-solving environment and a "safe place to practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>.
    *   **Training:** Recognize that [[public_sector_skills_for_international_collaboration | cross-border cooperation]] is a learned skill, not an innate one, and invest in training for [[public_sector_skills_for_international_collaboration | international working]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.
    *   **Identity Shift:** Cultivate an understanding that [[public_sector_skills_for_international_collaboration | internationalism]] and cross-border work are also questions of identity, moving beyond a purely local perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.
    *   **Incentives and Mandates:** Implement "carrots" (incentives) and "sticks" (mandatory requirements through law, regulation, or international standards) to encourage and ingrain collaboration within government processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.

## Addressing Uncertainty

Uncertainty is an inherent part of the modern world, and the best way to deal with it is through [[international_collaboration_during_crises | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic exemplified this, involving states, regions, international organizations (WHO, UN, EU, OECD), big pharma, scientists, the transport sector, procurement, trade finance, and NGOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>. When facing an uncertain situation, the worst response is to close shop and turn inward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>. Instead, collaboration allows for more options, shared learning, shared risk, and pooled resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. Effective states, democratic processes, and robust institutions are crucial in navigating uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.

## Initiatives and Commitments

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation have partnered to determine innovative practices for supporting [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Their research, global call for innovations, and workshops have identified how governments are leveraging new structures like innovative governance bodies, horizontal networks, and coordinated systems approaches to tackle transboundary issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Commitments from experts include:
*   **Asking the "Border Question"** Regularly prompt discussions about whether a problem or opportunity extends beyond a single jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
*   **Deeper Cooperation and Best Practice Exchange** Actively seek out and engage in new areas of [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | cross-border cooperation]] and share best practices to foster growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>.
*   **Active Listening** Prioritize listening to understand different perspectives, as it is the first step toward learning and potential collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>.
*   **Promoting Transnational Governance** Continue educating future leaders on the virtues and mechanics of transnational cooperation and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

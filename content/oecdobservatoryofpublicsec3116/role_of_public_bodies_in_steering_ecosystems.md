Public sector organizations play a crucial role in shaping innovation efforts, particularly within [[ecosystems_and_multistakeholder_collaboration | ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. As global crises have highlighted gaps in traditional approaches, there's a growing need for innovation to work more systemically, necessitating a clearer understanding of the public sector's role in an [[ecosystems_and_multistakeholder_collaboration | ecosystem of actors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Core Challenges for Public Bodies

Unlike the private sector, where a single financial bottom line simplifies direction setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, public sector returns of impact are difficult to measure and evaluate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Risk in the public sector extends beyond fiduciary concerns to programmatic and reputational factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. Furthermore, [[roles_and_challenges_in_public_sector_innovation | organizational culture and habits]] can create "dark matter" that influences and complicates efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

Governments face immensely complex challenges, such as climate change, which require radical societal and infrastructural transformation within tight deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This complexity leads to extreme uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Traditional planning tools designed for predictability have been exposed as insufficient during recent crises like the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## Leveraging Portfolio Approaches for Systemic Change

To navigate these complexities, portfolio approaches are seen as the most effective mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. These approaches allow for accelerated learning and the deliberate deployment of innovation, integrating policy and innovation in an experimental, experiential way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

Key aspects of public bodies steering [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]] through portfolio approaches include:

*   **Recognition of Implementation Gap** Public bodies must acknowledge the significant gap between policy commitments and individual innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. Solving complex problems requires sustained and systematic work to create a framework for systemic approaches and orchestrate relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Agreeing on Intent, Not Just Objectives** Instead of rigid objectives, public bodies should focus on agreeing on a common, shared commitment and a vision for transformation, even if the exact destination is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. This means acknowledging that "not knowing" is a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. This shared intent is crucial for building [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | broad engagement]] and can ideally be formalized into policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **Creating a Systemic Visual Frame** A visual, contextual, and systemic frame helps actors see how diverse initiatives (e.g., transport, community gardens, aging populations, healthcare) can relate within a larger whole, highlighting gaps and new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>. This resists the "gravitational pull" of rushing to immediate solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
*   **Building Flexibility into Budgets** Deliberately creating "budgets of flexibility" and spaces for possibility helps legitimize the idea that complexity is a feature, not a bug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. This encourages participation by showing that the portfolio is a space where many programs can meet and different objectives can be integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.
*   **Systematic Sense-Making and Learning** A portfolio approach truly comes to life when combined with systematic sense-making, extracting learning from diverse initiatives, and understanding the relationships between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. This disciplined practice of reflection and interrogation turns experience into actionable intelligence and decision support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. It allows for continuous adaptation based on what is learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

## The Role of Public Bodies as Ecosystem Steerers

Governments inherently represent [[ecosystems_and_multistakeholder_collaboration | ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. The challenge is to build capabilities and foster mindset shifts within public bodies to embrace new roles:

*   **Challenge Owner:** Holding accountability across political cycles and generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>.
*   **Orchestrator:** Proficiently connecting, bridging, convening, and facilitating disparate elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. This involves being a "gardener" or "editor," combining and connecting different ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
*   **Engaging Activists and Advocates:** Braiding together multiple interests to achieve whole-systems change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>.

This requires a shared narrative and vision â€” a common mental model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.

## Funding and Governance in Ecosystems

Funding for innovation portfolios needs to be agile and allow for distribution to multiple initiatives focused on learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. The traditional public procurement structures for pooling funds across ministries are often not in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>. There is a need for new financial instruments and a different intent for capital that is suitable for portfolio approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. Successfully structuring a portfolio can make it easier to unlock funding, particularly from diverse sources like structural funds and philanthropic capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>. The investment should be in the portfolio's capacity to induce effects and follow through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.

For governance, it is essential to involve funders and stakeholders in creating an "impact logic" and a "robust heuristic" that connects funding to inquiry, interrogation, and direct innovation-to-policy learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

## Overcoming Internal Barriers

A significant challenge is that innovation units within administrations often aim to change others but show limited willingness to challenge their own ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>. To address this, it's crucial to:

*   **Create Bridges Between Cultures:** Establish labs or entities that act as bridges between public administrations and citizens or other cultural approaches, facilitating dialogue that might otherwise be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.
*   **Focus on Practical Next Steps:** The goal of these collaborative spaces should be practical outcomes: understanding "what's next" and "what do we do next" together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>.
*   **Shift from Solution Provider to Gardener:** Public bodies must acknowledge that they don't have all the solutions and adapt their identity from a sole solution provider to a facilitator or "gardener" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

Ultimately, public bodies need to embrace "radical collaboration" as an explicit requirement for collective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>, and leverage technology, such as AI, to facilitate cross-relationship understanding rather than reinforce silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>. This systemic approach is fundamental for the [[governments_role_in_promoting_innovation | government's role in steering transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.

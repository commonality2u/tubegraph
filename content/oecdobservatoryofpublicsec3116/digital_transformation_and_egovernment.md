## The Rise of Digital Governance
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly emphasized the importance of [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]] and e-government. Discussions during the "Government Aftershock" event included topics such as [[digital_government | digital government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Governments have experienced a massive shift towards [[digitalization_and_remote_work_in_government | remote work]] and have been compelled to experiment with new approaches under challenging circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. This period has underscored the vital importance of digital governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

### Goals of Digitalization
A key objective of [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]] is to ensure that the digital economy substantially contributes to productivity and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. This involves implementing necessary regulations for platform companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Governments are encouraged to be more open and directly engage with citizens to combat misinformation, which threatens policy efficacy and undermines trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

## Serbia's Digitalization Journey
Serbia, for instance, prioritized digitization from 2017, aiming to make its government more efficient and transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. The focus was on:
*   **[[digitalization_and_government_services | E-government]]**: Fully digitizing government services to provide electronic services to citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.
*   **Digital Education**: Reforming schools with digital textbooks and classrooms to make learning more engaging and teach critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.
*   **Economic [[digital_transformation_in_governance | Digital Transformation]]**: Shifting the Serbian economy from labor-intensive and investment-driven to innovation-driven and knowledge-based to boost GDP growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.

These [[public_sector_digital_transformation | public sector digital transformation]] efforts proved beneficial during the 2020 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. Serbia was able to continue providing services to citizens and businesses electronically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a> and did not lose a single day of schooling, as digital education investments paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. The economy became more resilient, with the ICT sector reaching 6% of the total GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. Serbia's GDP decline for 2020 was projected at a comparatively low -1% or even -0.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, and unemployment did not increase, partly due to youth support programs like "My First Salary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

### The Power of Digital
A key strength of modern government, especially highlighted by the pandemic, is the ability to go digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>. Digitization allows governments to be available 24/7, 365 days a year for citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in government can automate repetitive tasks, allowing civil servants to focus on more meaningful work and providing round-the-clock service, leading to increased productivity and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.

Moving to digital services also significantly helps combat corruption by eliminating physical contact and making processes transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. For example, Serbia's fully electronic construction permitting process transformed it from a difficult and corrupt process to one of the world's most efficient, ranking among the top 10 countries for speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. This visible improvement directly led to an increase in infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.

Beyond efficiency, [[innovation_and_digital_transformation_in_public_services | innovation and digital transformation in public services]] contribute to environmental sustainability. Serbia's digitization efforts, starting in June 2017, saved an estimated 15,000 trees, 65 million liters of water, and 5,700 megawatts of electricity by reducing paper use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Implications
While [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | public sector innovation and digital transformation]] offers numerous benefits, the pandemic has also highlighted and exacerbated underlying issues such as inequalities and economic insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. The crisis has also aggravated a crisis of trust and instilled fear in the social fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

For governments to be better prepared for future crises, a new approach is needed, avoiding a return to "normal" because the previous normal was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. Future recovery efforts must be green, sustainable, and inclusive, prioritizing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. This means decisions made today, regarding technology and policy, will impact environmental outcomes and social inclusion for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

The pandemic has also underscored the "digital divide" â€“ lower-skilled individuals face greater difficulty in re-entering a job market that is becoming increasingly digitalized. Therefore, focusing on digital education and skills for these groups is crucial for future economic integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>.

The prime minister of Serbia noted a significant challenge in balancing individual freedoms and civil liberties with public health protection in a rapidly changing world, particularly in societies prone to conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. Measures like mandatory mask-wearing, social distancing rules, and contact tracing applications have raised complex questions about the limits of personal freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. This tension between protection and liberty is expected to remain a worldwide problem even post-pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.

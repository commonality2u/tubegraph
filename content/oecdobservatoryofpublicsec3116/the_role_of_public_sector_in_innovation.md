The world is rapidly changing, making the future unpredictable. To navigate this future, it's crucial to understand where disruptions originate and the direction the world is heading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Citizen Expectations and the Need for Transformation
Citizens today experience excellent services from the private sector and consequently expect public sector services to be customer-focused, efficient, [[innovation in public sector | innovative]], personalized, and technology-enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The fundamental question is how the public sector can provide such services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The answer lies in the need for the public sector to [[innovation in public sector | innovate]] and transform how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This means adopting [[innovation in public sector | innovative]] and agile practices, structures, and ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Key Actions for Public Sector Agility and Innovation

### Adopting Agile Practices
Formalizing agile working practices, such as remote working, is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The public sector can become an agile organization capable of providing excellent services for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. To achieve this, organizations must be flexible, adapt to citizens' needs, be flatter, team-based, connected, and aligned with strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Collaboration and Data Utilization
*   **External Collaboration**: Collaborating outside the government ecosystem is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Cooperation and exchange of good practices with other governments globally is also significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Data and Analytics**: It is vitally important to use data and analytics for building evidence-based policy making and finding [[innovation in public sector | innovative]] solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Co-creation**: Co-creating services with citizens is crucial, requiring the promotion of active citizenship and creating platforms to connect directly with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### People and Skills Development
The public sector must focus on its people, ensuring the right individuals are in the right places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Workforce Planning**: Strategic workforce planning is needed, and civil servants should be recruited for their [[innovation in public sector | innovative]] and collaborative qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Job Redesign**: Redesigning jobs and processes is important to enable greater efficiency and [[innovation in public sector | innovative]] thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning**: Continuously upskilling and reskilling civil servants is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Skills must keep pace with new technologies and complex societal problems to avoid becoming obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Beyond technical skills, critical thinking, creativity, [[innovation in public sector | innovation]], problem-solving, and anticipating future scenarios are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The most important skill is the ability to continuously learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Learning Organization**: Public administration should become a learning organization that can learn from the past and anticipate the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that public administration can be agile and responsive by adapting quickly to new ways of working and communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This agility and [[innovation in public sector | innovation]] should be embedded into structures and work processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Envisioning a Radically Different Public Sector
The world can be made differently, which is a good starting point for [[innovation in public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The past year has shown that radical change is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The question is whether this unique time can be used to imagine and implement a radically different public sector that is more fit for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Forces for Stability vs. Change
Historically, the public sector has been built for predictability, stability, and control, managing risk and ensuring large-scale, good quality services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. These are good traits, especially in times of crisis, as government serves as a last resort of stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. However, there's a constant need for transformation, [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], embracing digital solutions, and connecting with citizens to capture diverse societal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. There must be a continuous, proactive push for [[innovation in public sector | innovation]] and change to avoid lapsing back into old ways and failing to meet societal expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### New Approaches and Thinking
Instead of starting from the present, the public sector could imagine desired new futures and mobilize stakeholders around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

1.  **New Approaches**: Utilize foresight, scenarios, and future thinking to explore what might happen, acknowledging the uncertainty of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Combining design methods with foresight allows for immersing oneself in and exploring stories around the future, putting oneself in the shoes of future citizens or decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Collaboration and co-design, involving many decision-makers, experts, and citizens, are key to exploring different futures and making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
2.  **New Organization**: Embrace self-management and flatter structures, drawing inspiration from "reinventing organizations" and "teal organizations" focusing on peer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This also means bringing the whole person to work, not just the professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The public sector is inherently purpose-driven, which should facilitate embracing this way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Organizations can be led by a worldview that people want to make a difference, have influence, be challenged, take responsibility, help each other, and thrive in trust and recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
3.  **[[role_of_leadership_in_public_sector_innovation | New Leadership]]**: [[role_of_leadership_in_public_sector_innovation | Innovative leadership]] is about discovering what kind of change is needed and leading with exploration, openness, and discovery, rather than control and detailed administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. It involves exploring problems, leveraging empathy with citizens' needs, navigating ambiguity, and insisting on rehearsing, experimenting, and trying out the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
4.  **New Thinking**: Enhance engagement with critical global challenges and expand into new types of resources to think differently about the future (expansive thinking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This includes thinking differently about time horizons (e.g., 2050 timeline or even 9,000-year visions) and proximity (closeness to people, values, cross-sectors, digital dimensions, nature of life) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

## Public Sector as a Driver of Change
The public sector should not be merely reactive to forces like digitalization; it must actively participate in digital and broader societal transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Governments are the biggest funders of basic research and major spenders and demanders for change globally, possessing immense means and capabilities to steer or react productively to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

The future is not a singular path; different forces envision different types of changes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Technology, for example, allows for both centralized control (algorithmic governance, predictive traits) and hyper-personalization/distribution of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Major value transformations, like the green transition and climate change, also spur new ways of working cross-sectorally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.

Governments must be ethical towards the future ("karma of governments"), considering their long-term footprint beyond current actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. COVID-19 has accelerated change, particularly technology adoption, leading to different public sector interactions and increased automatization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. While unable to control environmental complexity, governments should not limit their role in impacting and acting on the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

## Specific Roles and Capabilities in Strategic Foresight

### Scouting and Naming Emerging Issues
A key role is to "scout," detecting early signals of change and thinking about emerging issues, trends, or driving forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. Giving these issues names is critical, as it makes them exist in discourse, allowing leaders and policymakers to discuss them and generate ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. Scouting needs discipline, with protected time and specific processes like scenario planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

### Challenging Mindsets and Structures
The public sector must challenge its current mindsets and structures that may be incompatible with desired future states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. Examples include resistance to remote working despite smart city infrastructure, or procurement processes impeding agile ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>. Futurists can help identify these "pain points" to prevent paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. Storytelling and scenarios can help immerse people and create empathy for future lived experiences, challenging current thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

### Growing Future-Oriented Capabilities
Since change and uncertainty are constant, the public sector needs to "play the long game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. This means growing the capability to think about the future and understand the value of different functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>.
*   **Training and Practice**: Combine formal training with hands-on practice, as true understanding of future thinking comes from doing the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   **Communities of Practice**: Build communities of practice around foresight and future thinking, contextualized to specific policy environments, and encourage collaborations among public agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   **People Development**: Develop people by training them in future thinking and releasing them back into the system to become multipliers and advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.

## Seizing the Moment for Change
The current "liquefaction moment" – when solid norms turn fluid due to events like COVID-19 – presents a critical opportunity for redesign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. This is the optimal time for change, whether redesigning a business or a policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. The shift from human-centered design to "human-connected design" emphasizes connections between humans, AI, infrastructure, places, and the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>.

### Building Shared Visions and Systemic Collaboration
*   **Envisioning Futures**: Governments need the confidence to envision future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. While utopias may not always energize, exploring dystopias can often capture imagination and drive action by highlighting risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.
*   **New Data and Insights**: Identify what kind of insights and information will be used for future decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>.
*   **Whole-System Collaboration**: Governments should use broader tools like convening and stewardship of whole systems, working across the social sector, private sector, and public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>. Bringing the public along and being open in decision-making are vital to achieving desired futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.
*   **Shifting Governance Models**: Moving from a competitive, command-and-control model to one that is much more open, collaborative, and creative is essential for [[innovation in public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>. The "art of the possible" expands in moments of change, opening the "Overton window" for what governments and citizens perceive as achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.

### Leveraging Demographic Shifts and Minimum Intervention
Move with existing change by understanding and leveraging demographic forces, such as generational cohorts, which represent significant drivers for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Like a "trim tab" on a ship's rudder, small, targeted interventions by [[innovation in public sector | innovation]] labs, teams, or even individuals can exert a massive, multiplying impact on complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>. This calls for connecting with an "inner Buckminster Fuller" and lifting horizons to seize the moment for positive futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

## Building Dynamic and Resilient Public Organizations
The core challenge is to make public organizations dynamic by design, rather than separating stable and dynamic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>. [[public_sector_innovation | Dynamic organizations]] are also resilient by design, able to offer services and solutions even in times of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

### Essential Capabilities
1.  **Reframing Problems**: The ability to frame or reframe problems is crucial, moving them away from policy silos and making them understandable to citizens, motivating staff, and communicating clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. This includes reframing issues like climate change beyond energy to food and clothing, or shifting from GDP to well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>.
2.  **Openness and [[innovation in public sector | Ethics of Innovation]]**: Public organizations are becoming more open by design, engaging with various stakeholders and viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. This involves flatter, team-focused structures and open digital infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>. An emerging capability is the [[innovation in public sector | ethics of innovation]], requiring civil servants to consider their biases and incorporate diverse perspectives when innovating in uncertain spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.
3.  **Diverse Analytical Capacities**: Governments tend to look backwards with analytical tools, making them poor at predicting future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. A safeguard against this is to build diversity into public sector organizations, incorporating diverse analytical viewpoints beyond statistical or economic analysis, such as ethnographic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>. This also ties into questions of power and how events are analyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

## Challenging Entrenched Futures
The public sector must challenge existing entrenched futures that are already being written:
*   **Capitalism**: The notion of capitalism as an opposition between government and market is a mistake, as all markets are co-created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>. Open government organizations should be more radical in rethinking the nature of markets and the desired form of capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>.
*   **Growth Narrative**: The entrenched focus on GDP growth in government statements needs to be debunked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>. Growth, as currently measured, has not dealt with climate emergencies or inequality, which have worsened even as economies grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.
*   **Linearity and Technocentric Beliefs**: The deep-seated paradigm of linearity, driving modernism and a technocentric belief in rationality, suggests the future will always be a better progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. However, this belief in progress has eroded, with many believing the future will be worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>. The public sector needs collective imagination to build more inclusive, circular, and connected economies, which will challenge fundamental power structures but offer huge opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>. Despite challenges, an optimistic spirit and belief in achieving a better future are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.

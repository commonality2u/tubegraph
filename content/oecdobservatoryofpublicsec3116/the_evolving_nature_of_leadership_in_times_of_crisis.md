The COVID-19 crisis has served as an "unprecedented global experiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, providing a new impetus for [[innovation_in_response_to_crisis | innovation practice]] around the world and heightening its sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. This period reveals significant insights into the evolving nature of public sector [[role_of_leadership_in_innovation | innovation]] and what governments can expect now and into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>. The central question for [[leadership and management changes postCOVID | leadership]] is how to push the boundaries of the conventional to spur lasting transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Shifting Paradigms in Public Sector [[leadership_and_organizational_readiness_for_future_challenges | Leadership]]

### From Knowing to Listening and Collaboration
A major learning from the pandemic is the struggle to truly listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Much decision-making has been based on an outdated idea that governments know what to do, will announce it, and people will follow, a notion now "unraveling right before our eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. [[leadership and management changes postCOVID | Leadership]] must foster "radical listening," recognizing that systems often lack empathy and are not optimized for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. When listening is done well, trust can grow, relationships can flourish, and good things can emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. The new role of government is to enable spaces of listening, learning, and collaboration to grow, sharing power rather than giving it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

### Beyond Traditional Policy-Making and Public Management
The crisis has accelerated a questioning of traditional policy-making, which tends to be scattergun in influencing complex [[systems_thinking_in_government_during_crises | systems]] and too path-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. While policies were made and enacted more quickly than ever thought possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, there's a need for a shift towards "thinking like a system, acting like an entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

The "massive global failed experiment" of New Public Management (NPM) has been highlighted as insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. The crisis reveals a dual momentum: a "technocratic imperative" with growth in digital public services and analytical skills, and a "relational imperative" emphasizing collaboration between state, citizen, and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. The key challenge for [[leadership and management changes postCOVID | leadership]] is combining these two imperatives to create a new model for public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

### Building on Pre-existing Foundations
Governments that had made prior investments in basic and fundamental infrastructure had more options to improvise and [[resilience_and_innovation_in_pandemic_response | innovate]] during the emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Examples include Asian countries building on SARS protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, African countries leveraging Ebola protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, and investments in digital safety nets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. High social capital and trust allowed for unlocking new opportunities for collaboration, such as public-private partnerships in Korea or low-cost testing in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. The crisis exacerbates issues in low-trust environments or those with poor basic infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_opportunities_of_public_sector_innovation_in_a_crisis | Challenges and Opportunities for Leadership]]

### Navigating Uncertainty and Expanding Policy Options
The pandemic is one of the largest natural comparative public policy experiments in 90 years, with the virus as a constant, creating both opportunities and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Policy makers navigate "unnerving degrees of uncertainty" and must rapidly revalidate knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. However, policy options have also expanded; previously unacceptable choices (e.g., social distancing, free childcare, universal basic income) have been broadly tolerated or welcomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. This indicates a fluid social contract and the exercise of new societal muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

### Overcoming Silos and Fostering Transparency
Government departments often operate in silos, leading to "more shouting frankly than there is listening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. However, communities are showing how to govern better, experimenting and connecting in new ways regardless of centralized government actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. Governments have shown a growing maturity in changing their language around trying new things and admitting they don't know all the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. They have also resisted media arguments about "U-turns," indicating a public willingness to accept learning and adaptation in complex situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

A "smart government" will anticipate questions and calls for public inquiries, proactively thinking about a new transparency agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

### Re-evaluating Incentive Structures
A key concern is whether the deep incentive structures in politics and government have truly changed, or if innovation is merely tolerated due to unavoidable necessity during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>. The return to "normal" post-vaccine could mean a reversion to old practices, such as requiring five letters for inter-ministerial meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

However, the crisis has exposed undeniable truths: the growing complexity of problems that previous models failed to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>, and the widespread experience of poverty and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>. Furthermore, the crisis has challenged orthodoxies around public finance, revealing that historical spending constraints were often artificial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>. It has become "increasingly stark" that underfunding certain areas is a strategic choice, potentially leading to public demands for greater investment in critical areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

### [[impact_of_crisis_management_on_innovation | Impact on Talent and Workforce Wellbeing]]
The crisis has highlighted the importance of improvisation, projecting individuals from lower ranks to crucial tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. There is a sense of "reflectivity" and "reflection" among civil servants, who have reconnected with their purpose and gained humility due to the personal impact of the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

However, a "sense of utter exhaustion" is prevalent across many levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>, raising questions about public sector well-being. To liberate talent, [[leadership]] needs to "stop doing things and to start being something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>, focusing on values, behaviors, and relationships, like New Zealand's "Moral Spirit of Service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. Creating safe learning environments where people can reconnect and be heard is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>.

## The Path Forward for [[leadership_and_organizational_readiness_for_future_challenges | Leaders]]

### Inspiring a New Generation
Younger generations entering the civil service are looking for "inspirational leadership" focused on the "being of leadership" rather than just "doing stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>. The job of leaders is to be inspirational and drive change, making public service attractive as a real community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.

### The Role of Experimentation and Partnerships
Future change will be determined by continued experimentation and [[innovation_in_response_to_crisis | innovation]], especially in cities, which are seen as a fertile scale for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Global curiosity about different approaches will accelerate learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. The private sector, having become more socially conscious, also has a crucial role, ideally collaborating responsibly rather than solely pursuing contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.

### Crafting a New Narrative
There is a need for a new narrative of success that moves beyond purely "technocratic solutions" and embraces broader societal cohesion and inclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Developing countries, particularly in Asia, offer opportunities to radically rethink narratives, as traditional "best practices" have been "really damaged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>. International organizations like the OECD should shift investment from content to relationships, enabling collaboration and strengthening networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>. They should also use their influence to advocate for "next-generation governance, decision-making, finance, and public sector management" to move beyond "zombie orthodoxies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.

The crisis reveals "plastic hours," crucial moments where alignment of public opinion, political power, and events makes action possible, turning a stiff social order pliable. These moments, often triggered by crises, depend on social mobilization and [[leadership]], and can be wasted if not seized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.

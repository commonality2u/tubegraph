Governments today face significant challenges due to the extraordinary pace and complexity of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It is increasingly evident that new and innovative approaches are required from governments to tackle major societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. These challenges include climate change, infectious diseases, and [[impact_of_disruptive_technologies_on_public_service | digital disruption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Addressing the Challenge

Organizations like the OECD Observatory of [[impact_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) are working to embed [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | innovation]] at the core of government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Their efforts aim to empower public servants by providing them with new insights, tools, and connections, enabling them to explore novel possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

To support this, OPSI conducts cutting-edge research to identify emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. They also collaborate with leading experts to offer trusted advice, striving to normalize new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This work extends globally, covering OECD countries and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. While governments will undoubtedly encounter more challenges, collective action can help anticipate and respond to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The goal is to support the development of improved and more innovative policies for enhanced lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

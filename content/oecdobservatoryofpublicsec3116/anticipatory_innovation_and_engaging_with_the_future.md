[[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] is fundamentally about [[challenges_and_strategies_for_implementing_anticipatory_innovation | engaging with the future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It represents one of the most uncertain areas of [[anticipatory_innovation | innovation]] because the future is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Why Engage with the Future?

Governments need to engage with concepts and developments that are not yet reality today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This is crucial because once [[anticipatory_innovation | innovation]] occurs and dominant designs emerge, it becomes very difficult to alter things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### The Challenge of Locked Systems

A historical example is the decision on which side of the road cars should drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Whether it was the right or left, that initial [[anticipatory_innovation | innovation]] locked many mobility systems, influencing how cars are driven and how infrastructure is developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. These decisions, made long ago, continue to shape our present mobility practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Today, we face new technological and non-technological choices that will become dominant designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Role of Governments

Governments must strive to be "a little ahead of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. While it's not always possible to definitively know what will happen, it is essential to analyze and consider a variety of possible futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This foresight allows for the potential to influence emerging dominant designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Contemporary Examples

One significant current concern revolves around [[role_of_technology_in_anticipatory_innovation | artificial intelligence]] (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Questions about the necessary technological and [[incorporating_values_in_anticipatory_innovation | ethical solutions]] for AI require [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This involves:
*   Anticipating different types of solutions as they emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Shaping these [[anticipatory_innovation | innovations]] as they begin to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

For instance, defining [[incorporating_values_in_anticipatory_innovation | ethical boundaries]] for [[role_of_technology_in_anticipatory_innovation | artificial intelligence]] or deciding on the adoption of [[role_of_technology_in_anticipatory_innovation | blockchain]] solutions are questions that can be influenced now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. However, these opportunities will likely be lost in ten or fifteen years when AI or [[role_of_technology_in_anticipatory_innovation | blockchain]] use is widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

To remain influential and advocate for the best interests of their populations and countries, governments must anticipate future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

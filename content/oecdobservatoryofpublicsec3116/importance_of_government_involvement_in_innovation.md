Anticipatory innovation involves engaging with the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This is one of the most uncertain areas of innovation because the future is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite this uncertainty, governments need to engage with concepts and technologies that are not yet a reality today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Why Governments Must Engage with the Future

It is crucial for governments to be proactive because once innovation occurs and dominant designs emerge, it becomes very difficult to change things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

For instance, the decision regarding which side of the road cars drive on was an innovation that, once established, locked a lot of mobility systems into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This decision dictates how cars are driven and how infrastructure is developed for movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This foundational innovation, based on training practices, happened a long time ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Today, society faces many new [[impact_of_technological_disruption_on_government_innovation | technological and non-technological choices]] that can become innovations and dominant designs in their own right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Therefore, governments need to be somewhat ahead of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. While it's not always possible to know for certain what will happen, governments must analyze and consider a variety of possible futures to influence emerging dominant designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Anticipatory Innovation in Modern Challenges

Current [[challenges_requiring_government_innovation | major concerns]] include artificial intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Governments need anticipatory innovation to determine what kind of technological or [[role_of_regulation_in_innovation | ethical solutions]] are required for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This means anticipating different types of solutions as they emerge and actively shaping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

For example, [[role_of_governments_in_fostering_innovation | governments need to decide]] on ethical boundaries for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, and whether or which blockchain solutions should be adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These are questions that can be influenced now, but likely not in 10 or 15 years when AI becomes a widespread reality or a large proportion of the population uses blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

To be proactive and have a say in what is best for their [[impact_of_government_innovation_on_citizens | people]] and countries, [[the_role_of_public_sector_in_innovation | governments]] must anticipate future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

[[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | Strategic foresight]] is defined by the OECD as "the ability to constantly perceive, make sense of and act on the future in the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Its primary benefit is to inform and enable better decision-making today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. A key aspect of effective [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] is its collaborative nature, fostering structured, participatory, inclusive, impactful, and systemic approaches to understanding future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Why Collaboration is Key
[[foresight_and_scenario_planning | Foresight]], by definition, involves crossing different boundaries:
*   **Time** By looking beyond the present to the past and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Policy Domains** Challenges are interconnected and do not fit neatly into single policy areas <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Actors** Governments need to work with various stakeholders, including academia, EU institutions, and other initiatives, as they cannot achieve societal goals in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

Collaboration helps in understanding [[challenges_of_implementing_foresight_in_public_sectors | challenges]] and opportunities, and co-creating [[anticipatory_innovation_and_foresight | anticipatory intelligence]] necessary for addressing current societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Collaborative Approaches in Practice

### Government of Flanders
The Government of Flanders, in collaboration with the OECD, has developed a blueprint for embedding [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] into its system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Their "Strategic Foresight for Resilience" initiative, launched during the COVID-19 crisis, emphasizes the need for [[anticipatory_innovation_and_foresight | anticipatory intelligence]] in volatile and complex times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Four key functions guide their approach:
1.  **Discover**: Involves [[strategic_foresight_tools_and_methods | trend and weak signal analysis]], requiring time and skilled personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
2.  **Explore**: Making sense of insights through [[strategic_foresight_tools_and_methods | Horizon scanning]] and system analysis, often engaging with the science community via "science to policy dialogues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
3.  **Map**: Connecting intelligence with current [[role_of_foresight_in_policymaking | policymaking]] through [[foresight_and_scenario_planning | explorative scenarios]] (e.g., "Resilient Europe" project with 10 other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>) and resilient indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
4.  **Create**: Focusing on impact and scale by building visions, roadmaps, and "coalitions for the future," underscoring the necessity for governments to work together with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

### Finland's Proactive Governance
Finland utilizes a multi-layered system for [[anticipatory_innovation_and_strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | anticipatory governance]], including:
*   **Committee for the Future** in Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.
*   **Strategic Foresight Team** in the Prime Minister's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   **Citra**: Produces megatrend reports and facilitates national dialogues for citizen participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.
*   **Sectoral Ministries & Government Agencies**: Have strategy and research units or innovation labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.
*   **Networks**: Foresight and [[anticipatory_innovation_and_foresight | innovation]] practitioners share insights and envision projects together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
*   **Future Research Centers**: Focus on specific areas like technology or health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

Despite numerous assets, an "impact gap" exists between these activities and core government processes. The goal is to integrate [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_organization and governance | foresight]] into everyday policy cycles through dialogue between specialists, policymakers, and decision-makers, leading to policy coherence, effective budgeting, and impactful innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

### Estonia's Foresight Center
The Estonian Parliament's [[foresight_and_scenario_planning | foresight]] Center informs the public and Parliament members about alternative scenarios, future risks, and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.
*   **Topic Selection**: Parliament members propose topics for [[foresight_and_scenario_planning | foresight]] studies, ensuring relevance to political factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.
*   **Steering Committees**: Ministries and interested Parliament members are directly involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.
*   **Media Amplification**: Proactive media engagement is used to convey messages to Parliament members and trigger responses from Ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.
*   **Numbers-driven Insights**: Combining [[strategic_foresight_tools_and_methods | foresight methods]] with traditional analysis and hypothetical simulations (e.g., budgetary impact) is crucial for engaging politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.

### Wales Futures Commission
Wales's unique approach to [[foresight_and_scenario_planning | foresight]] is rooted in the "Well-being of Future Generations Act" (2015), which mandates a Future Trends Report and emphasizes "long-term" as a key working principle for sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.

### EU Policy Lab & Lithuania 2050
The EU Policy Lab, part of the Joint Research Center, focuses on applying collaborative, systemic, and forward-looking approaches to bring scientific knowledge into EU [[role_of_foresight_in_policymaking | policymaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
*   **Lithuania 2050 Project**: Used [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] to develop a national long-term strategy, starting with a small group of experts and growing to involve many more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.
*   **Ecosystems Approach**: Advocates for thinking in terms of "supply and demand" for [[foresight_and_scenario_planning | foresight]], focusing on culture, behavior, processes, structures, and people rather than just a "super team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.
*   **Embedding Foresight**: Emphasizes avoiding [[challenges_of_implementing_foresight_in_public_sectors | foresight]] as "just another brick in the wall," instead embedding it throughout the policy cycle to challenge conventional thinking and enable a culture of anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. This requires inclusive participation of multiple actors and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Future-oriented Policymaking**: A new project aims to create [[strategic_foresight_tools_and_methods | tools and capacity building]] for member states' public administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>.

## Measuring Impact of Collaborative Foresight
Measuring the impact of [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] is complex, as there are no clear-cut metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>. However, impact can be observed by how widely the message or insights spread among policy designers and in public discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>. If key persons realize an issue and act upon it, this indicates success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>. Setting thresholds or milestones, such as a certain number of policy designers recognizing an issue, can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>.

Ultimately, collaboration in [[foresight_and_scenario_planning | foresight]] fosters a vibrant community of practitioners dedicated to integrating long-term perspectives into [[role_of_foresight_in_policymaking | policymaking]], aiming to create more resilient societies and shape a positive future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:35">[01:24:35]</a>.

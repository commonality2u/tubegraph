The evolving relationship between government and citizens is a central theme in discussions about the future of democracy. This shift is driven by a recognition that people's expectations for [[inclusive_and_accessible_democratic_participation | participation]] in public decision-making have significantly changed, with citizens becoming less trusting of government but more engaged on issues affecting them and their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Rethinking Democracy as a "Design"

A core idea in fostering this new relationship is the concept that democracy itself is a "design" that can be "redesigned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This perspective challenges the notion of democracy as something static or "carved in stone," suggesting it must be actively practiced and trained to remain strong and competent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Zakia Elvang, co-founder of We Do Democracy, highlights the importance of "[[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | democratic fitness]]" â€“ strengthening people's "democratic muscles" such as listening, empathy, compromising, and activism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This approach aims to move democracy out of the "lecture room" and into a more active and playful arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## The Challenge of Trust and Power

A crucial element in changing the relationship between citizens and the state is a fundamental shift in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. Governments need to trust citizens and meaningfully empower them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. As John Alexander, founder of the New Citizenship Project, notes, this trust-building needs to start from the "inside out" within institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

Pepin Kennis, an Agora MP in the Brussels region parliament, emphasizes that if politicians don't trust citizens to make the "right decisions," it raises questions about trusting them to vote for the right people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. The motto "say what you do and do what you say" is crucial for [[citizen_trust_and_public_communication | transparency]] and [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | trust]] in democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>.

## Beyond One-Off Engagement: Cultivating Long-Term Relationships

Concerns exist that while many [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | democratic innovations]], such as [[role_of_deliberative_democracy_and_citizens_assemblies | citizens' assemblies]], are being implemented, they might be perceived as "one-off" events rather than leading to "long-lasting love relationship[s]" with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>. Zakia Elvang expresses a "deep fear" that without real power or long-term engagement, these efforts could disappoint citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

Gaitan, from the common secretariat of the Conference on the Future of Europe, points out that it's important to clarify to citizens that these are not direct democracy processes, and not all recommendations will be adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. However, there is a "silent revolution" occurring, with efforts to put citizens at the center of such initiatives and shift political culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. John Alexander advocates for a "yes, and" approach, encouraging citizens and civil society to engage with opportunities for power when offered, even if not perfect, to build a virtuous cycle of participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.

To properly assess impact, a new language is needed to talk about "democratic impact goals" beyond just legislation, encompassing factors like trust-building, stronger networks, and increased [[inclusive_and_accessible_democratic_participation | engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>. This focus on outcomes like strengthening citizens' sense of agency and political efficacy is invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

## The Role of Media and Public Space

The rise of [[digital_and_virtual_engagement_for_effective_citizen_participation | digital engagement]] also presents challenges. Dan Podjed, a PhD anthropologist, highlights the worrying trend of increased screen time, leading to what he terms "digital feudalism" or "surveillance capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. This privatization of public space, both online and offline, impacts power dynamics and can undermine genuine [[inclusive_and_accessible_democratic_participation | citizen participation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. He argues for the importance of "analog" components of democracy and physical spaces for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>.

Gaitan points out a critical need for cultural change within the media sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. Media often focuses on conflict, which attracts attention, but peaceful, innovative democratic processes struggle for visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>. Increased media attention and visibility are essential for these processes to be impactful, as this can pressure politicians to act on citizen recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. The hope is that media will recognize its contribution to democracy by covering these quieter, yet transformative, developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly highlighted the dynamics of [[International Collaboration on Governance Innovation | international collaboration]] in governance, prompting a re-evaluation of both national and global responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While the crisis initially focused on national responses, it underscored the critical importance for national governments to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Initial National Responses and Their Limitations
The pandemic had a profound impact on international cooperation, reinforcing trends towards unilateralism and, in some cases, outright conflict between nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The immediate reflex of many countries, particularly the most powerful and developed ones, was to "turn national" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This involved measures such as export bans on essential medical equipment and numerous individual actions taken without coordination or learning from other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Despite these initial nationalistic tendencies, the global reach of the COVID-19 crisis quickly exposed the inefficiencies of purely national responses to an intrinsically global issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. As people, goods, services, and diseases constantly cross borders, domestic actions alone cannot effectively address transboundary challenges like a virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. This highlighted a clear mismatch between global realities calling for cooperation and traditional, often outdated, national legal and regulatory processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

## Examples of Successful Collaboration
Despite initial unilateralism, the crisis also spurred significant, albeit at times haphazard, cooperation among governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Scientific Community
The international scientific community demonstrated remarkable collaboration by sharing the virus's DNA sequence and research, leading to the rapid development of vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This is seen as a "miracle" due to its speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Business and Trade
Businesses, both small and large, demonstrated adaptability by changing production (e.g., a vodka company producing disinfectant alcohol) and collaborating with governments and municipalities globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The initial export bans were a major drawback for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>, but existing trade deals and [[International Collaboration on Governance Innovation | international cooperation]] helped quickly restore supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. A significant example is the recent trade deal among 15 Asian countries, representing one-third of the global population, which occurred during the crisis, demonstrating a collective realization that trade restrictions are unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. This highlights the importance of global supply chains, where products are "made in the global world" rather than a single country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

### Intellectual Property (IP) System
The international IP system, largely managed through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), continued to function effectively during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. WIPO facilitated informal discussions and information sharing, adapting to hybrid meeting formats to accommodate delegates globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

An [[Innovative approaches in public sector organizations | innovative approach]] is the IP Global AI Network, a platform fostering [[International Collaboration on Governance Innovation | international collaboration]] and co-development of AI and machine learning tools for patent offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. This initiative aims to reduce duplication and create a secure way to share AI tool development, helping less resourced offices overcome the digital divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

## Structural Challenges to Optimal Cooperation
Despite the clear need and some instances of cooperation, a significant gap remains between the necessity for [[International Collaboration on Governance Innovation | international cooperation]] and the ability to achieve an optimal level of collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. These challenges, many predating COVID-19 but exacerbated by it, include:

*   **Politics:** Geopolitical tensions and states' reluctance to grant international organizations (IOs) enforcement or inspection powers limit their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Financing:** Chronic underfunding of IOs, such as the WHO, prevents them from fulfilling their mandates effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
*   **Capacity:** Many developing countries lack the resources and capacity to implement their international obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide:** Differences in how countries gather data and the lack of interoperability between digital technologies create challenges for effective data sharing and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## The Future of Multilateralism and Governance
The crisis has prompted a rethinking of multilateralism. While the concept of the nation-state is not outdated – indeed, populism and nationalism show strong attachment to it – the way countries cooperate is evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.

*   **Evolving IOs:** [[International Collaboration on Governance Innovation | International organizations]] are striving to remain relevant by undergoing reforms to improve stakeholder consultation, assess instrument implementation, and coordinate with other bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>. Many adapted their working methods to allow for virtual decision-making under time pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>.
*   **Diverse Actors:** The IO landscape is becoming more diverse, including private standard-setting bodies and transgovernmental networks of regulators that bring together national agencies, private sector, and technical experts to develop specialized instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>. Governments are increasingly dependent on non-state actors for data and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.
*   **Collective Action:** A collective undertaking of 50 IO partners is committed to improving the quality of their rulemaking through the IO Partnership for Effective International Rule-Making. This initiative aims to make international rules more inclusive, effective, systematically implemented, and coherent through stronger coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.
*   **Beyond Territory:** While the nation-state remains central, new organizational models based on common interests, such as multinational companies, international NGOs, and virtual groups, operate beyond territorial boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. These groups are increasingly working alongside governments in [[participatory_processes_and_governance | multi-stakeholder partnerships]], particularly for public issues like environment or health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.

The overarching lesson from the crisis is the imperative for governments to learn to cooperate effectively and systematically, not just in times of acute crisis, to build resilience for future global shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This requires fostering open societies, strengthening [[International Collaboration on Governance Innovation | international regulatory cooperation]], and continually learning from past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.

[[missionoriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is defined by a clear purpose for why innovation is needed, specifically to solve a set challenge or problem within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It is fundamentally about purpose-driven innovation with clear goals established for the innovation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Moonshot: A Prime Example

One of the most recognized examples of [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] is the moonshot, which aimed to send humanity to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This endeavor had an unambiguous goal: either the moon was reached, or it wasn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The entire system, such as that within NASA, was structured to achieve this singular mission and goal of reaching the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Broad Societal Impact

The impact of [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] extends beyond its immediate goals:

*   **Direct Innovation**
    Significant innovation occurred directly as a result of projects like the moonshot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. These direct innovations contribute specifically to the challenge being addressed.

*   **Emergent and [[side_effects_and_unintended_innovations_from_mission_driven_projects | Side-Effect Innovations]]**
    Beyond direct outcomes, many different types of innovations can emerge as a [[side_effects_and_unintended_innovations_from_mission_driven_projects | side effect of the mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. These unexpected innovations can often lead to broader societal benefits.

*   **Future Benefits**
    The process of pursuing clear innovation goals often generates many new ideas connected to that primary objective, which may prove beneficial in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. While the end goal remains specific (e.g., touching the moon), the journey cultivates a fertile ground for wider innovation and societal advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

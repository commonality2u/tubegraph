[[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | Strategic foresight]] is defined by the OECD as the ability to constantly perceive, make sense of, and act on the future in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Its primary purpose is not to predict the future, but to facilitate better decision-making in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This means using [[strategic_foresight_tools_and_methods | strategic foresight products]] like forecasting and scenarios to make more prepared decisions, stress-test innovative solutions, and future-proof current actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Benefits of Strategic Foresight

[[strategic_foresight_for_future_global_challenges | Strategic foresight]] offers several benefits for organizations and governments:
*   **Structured Approach** It provides a structured, participatory, inclusive, impactful, and systemic way to look at future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Time Horizons** While typically dealing with medium to long-term futures, its relevance can span shorter periods (e.g., months for AI or weeks for COVID-19 pandemic predictions) depending on the volatility of the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Priority Setting** It helps in setting priorities and steering current policies towards common long-term objectives and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Identify Opportunities and Challenges** It aids in identifying future challenges and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Invest in Innovation** It guides investment in innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Stress-testing and Future-proofing** It allows organizations to stress-test current decisions and policies, ensuring they are built and future-proofed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Shared Visions** It can help build shared visions and success stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Integrating Foresight in Practice

Integrating [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] effectively requires building a governance system that allows for its most effective use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This involves engaging with uncertainty, ensuring continuity across policy cycles, and leveraging [[strategic_foresight_and_innovation_in_government | transformative innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Key elements include leadership, knowledge, capabilities, intelligence sense-making, governance structures, and coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Government of Flanders

The Government of Flanders, in collaboration with the OECD, has developed a blueprint for embedding [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] into its multi-level system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This initiative, known as "Strategic Foresight for Resilience," was launched during the COVID-19 crisis to generate anticipatory intelligence in volatile and complex times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

[[collaborative_approaches_in_foresight | Foresight]], by definition, involves crossing boundaries of time, policy domains, and actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. It helps policymakers understand interlinked trends and challenges, and recognize that solutions must be inter-related and cross different policy areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

The blueprint identifies four key functions for embedding foresight:
1.  **Discover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>: Involves trend and weak signal analysis, requiring time and skilled personnel with a mandate to look for emerging patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
2.  **Explore** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>: Focuses on making sense of insights from discovery through horizon scanning, pattern analysis, and system analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Engaging with the science community through science-to-policy dialogues is crucial here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
3.  **Map** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>: Connects created intelligence with current policymaking by mapping opportunities and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This includes building explorative scenarios, using tools like Futures Wheels, and mapping resilient indicators to understand future potential and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
4.  **Create** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>: Aims for impact and scale by developing visions, roadmaps, and [[collaborative_approaches_in_foresight | coalitions for the future]] to drive recovery and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Finland's Multi-Asset Approach

Finland has a comprehensive system of "multiple [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>, including:
*   A Committee for the Future in Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.
*   A [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] team in the Prime Minister's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   Citra, which produces megatrend reports and facilitates national dialogues for citizen participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.
*   Strategy and research units within sectoral ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.
*   Innovation Labs in government agencies, combining [[strategic_foresight_and_innovation_in_government | foresight and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
*   Networks of foresight and innovation practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.
*   A Future Research Center and sector-specific research institutes responsible for [[technology_foresight_and_governance | technology foresight]] and future of health, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

Despite these assets, Finland has identified an "impact gap" in integrating these activities into core government processes like public sector innovation and ministerial strategic work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>. The focus is on integrating foresight into everyday policy cycles, fostering dialogue between foresight specialists, policymakers, and decision-makers to inform strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. This leads to policy coherence, reflected in budgeting, management, and impactful innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

### Estonia's Parliamentary Foresight

Estonia's Foresight Center, linked to the Parliament, aims to inform the wider public and Parliament members about alternative scenarios, future risks, and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>. The center works topic-wise, often tackling two to three topics annually, proposed by Parliament members to ensure relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.

Impact is measured by how Parliament members adopt and convey the insights, influencing ministerial work when they publicly debate issues identified by the Foresight Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>. The center also involves Ministries directly through steering committees for each topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.

Key lessons from Estonia include:
*   **Proactive Media Engagement**: Using media proactively to amplify messages, as MPs tend to take insights more seriously when they read about them in the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.
*   **Numbers and Financial Impact**: Combining foresight methods with traditional analysis to provide numbers and hypothetical simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>. Talking about budgetary impact is particularly instrumental in engaging Parliament members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>.

### Wales' Legislative Approach to Future Generations

Wales has a unique approach to foresight, stemming from the *Well-being of Future Generations Act* (2015) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. This legislation established:
*   National well-being goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>.
*   Legal duties and an independent Future Generations Commissioner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.
*   A duty on Welsh ministers to publish a Future Trends Report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.
*   "Long-term" as one of five essential ways of working for sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>.

The Future Trends Report curates foresight products for different audiences, using infographics, narrative summaries, and evidence packs to convey insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>. Integration involves looking for logical entry points within existing government systems and processes:
*   It's a central part of impact assessment processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.
*   Included in procurement and grants processes with appraisals of long-term consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.
*   Part of corporate Learning and Development, with training for civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>.
*   Integrated into regional place-specific plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.
*   A small dedicated team acts as a hub for advice, empowering others to use foresight tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

This has led to key government strategies shifting focus to longer-term pictures (e.g., transport, development, waste strategies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. Wales emphasizes leveraging the science-policy interface and harnessing networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. They are developing a Wales Futures Hub to pool resources, diversify perspectives, and provide constructive challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.

### Nesta: Informing Transformative Innovation

Nesta, a UK-based innovation agency for social good, uses [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] to inform [[strategic_foresight_and_innovation_in_government | transformative innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. Their Discovery team, embedded in strategy, helps colleagues anticipate changes in technology and society to integrate learning into strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.

They support teams through:
*   **Horizon Scanning**: To understand the impact of emerging technology and social change (e.g., Future Signals series, Minister for the Future essay series) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.
*   **Stress Testing and Big Questions**: Answering crucial questions for mission colleagues (e.g., how will people heat homes in 15 years, lessons from international obesity policies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **Novel Approaches**: Blending methodologies from traditional foresight to data science, qualitative research, and design (e.g., Innovation Sweet Spots program combining foresight with open data sets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>.
*   **Speculating and Prototyping**: Exploring future possibilities and creating tangible examples (e.g., generative AI in early years education, future uses for the UK's gas grid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.
*   **Exposing Staff to New Ideas**: Bringing in external perspectives and practices (e.g., Discovery Month on generative AI, expert residencies like a heat pump installer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>.
*   **Creating Space for Exploration**: Designing programs for experimental, self-directed work (e.g., sabbaticals, Explorations Week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_implementing_foresight_in_public_sectors | Challenges]] and Enabling Factors

Common [[challenges_of_implementing_foresight_in_public_sectors | barriers]] to [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] implementation include:
*   Lack of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.
*   Organizational silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.
*   Workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   Budget constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.
*   Short-term thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
*   Overwhelm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   Lack of training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   Insufficient capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

Enabling factors for integrating foresight include:
*   **Clear Expectation Management**: Clearly defining principles, activities, and outputs before, during, and after the foresight process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
*   **Balanced Internal-External Capacity**: Ensuring sufficient internal capacity for designing and collaborating on initiatives, even when working with external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   **Shifting from Projects to Structural Mandate**: Moving beyond fragmented project-based initiatives to a more structural mandate for foresight within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.
*   **Ecosystems Approach**: Thinking in terms of supply and demand within a healthy foresight ecosystem, focusing on culture, behavior, processes, structures, and people, rather than relying on a single "super team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>. Changing culture and behavior is often the most difficult aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>.

### Measuring Impact

[[measuring_the_impact_of_strategic_foresight_in_decision_making | Measuring the impact of strategic foresight]] is complex, with no single "right" metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. Indicators can include:
*   The spread of foresight messages among policy designers and in public discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.
*   Tracking whether key persons realize an issue and act upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>.
*   Setting thresholds or milestones, such as a certain number of policy designers realizing a need to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>.

Ultimately, foresight's transformational power lies in challenging conventional thinking and assumptions at all stages of policymaking to enable a culture of anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.

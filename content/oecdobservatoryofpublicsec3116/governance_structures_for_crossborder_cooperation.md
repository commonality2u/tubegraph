Traditional public sector innovation research has often focused on governments' capacity to innovate within their established territories and jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, as problems evolve from complicated to complex, and from local to global, governments increasingly need to collaborate to find solutions for shared issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This necessitates innovative [[Governance structures and policy coordination in missions | governance structures]] to support [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Since the COVID-19 crisis, governments have rapidly unleashed innovation, but the crisis also exposed a lack of preparedness for global challenges and weaknesses in [[intergovernmental_cooperation_and_policy_integration | international cooperation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Major issues like COVID-19, climate change, digitalization, and migration transcend borders, demanding collective action across countries and policy fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Why Cross-Border Innovation is Challenging
Despite the clear need, government innovation efforts are largely confined to national or local borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This can be attributed to several factors:
*   **Lack of Public Awareness** [[crossborder_government_innovation | Cross-border innovation]] is not widely discussed or understood by the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **Lack of Permission** Government agency personnel may not feel they have the "permission" to look beyond their jurisdiction, with cross-border efforts sometimes being discouraged as outside their key performance indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Tribal Differences** Organizations and individuals tend to believe their own work is the most important, and cultural differences, even within a single country, can create barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.
*   **Funding Metrics** Financial arrangements can act as barriers, with treasuries sometimes netting off benefits generated in neighboring jurisdictions, disincentivizing [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | co-investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.
*   **Polarization and Inward Focus** Tools like social media, which were supposed to foster global community, can actually polarize societies, driving a focus inward rather than outward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. Historical swings from globalization to an emphasis on the state can also hinder [[intergovernmental_cooperation and policy integration | cooperation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>.

## Innovative Governance Mechanisms
Research by the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed Bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation has identified three main themes or "modes" of [[governance_structures_and_policy_coordination_in_missions | governance structures]] adopted by governments to support [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>:

1.  **Building Cross-Border Governance Bodies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>
    *   This involves creating new, formal "top-down" or "center-out" structures to unify the efforts of actors divided by existing borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
    *   **Example: The Quarkin Council** The first legal Nordic cross-border entity, it leverages cross-sector collaborative methods to drive future-oriented opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This council has fostered over 100 projects and its formalization as a European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) has made finding financing and decision-making easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.

2.  **Innovative Networks Tackling Cross-Border Collaboration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
    *   While formal bodies are top-down, these approaches involve horizontal linkages and more informal methods, often nurtured or participated in by governments who cede some control to other groups and act as one player among many through global networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    *   **Example: The Open European Dialogue** A network of parliamentarians across Europe from different countries and even opposing parties, where they collaborate through experimental dialogue and foster shared learning in a neutral space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

3.  **Exploring Emerging Governance System Dynamics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>
    *   This theme focuses on [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border collaborations]] that pioneer holistic new governance systems to foster new ways of working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This can include mechanisms for [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | co-financing]], [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | co-governance]], co-project management, service design, and policy design and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
    *   **Example: The Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal** A new governance system in North England and South Scotland that secured nearly Â£500 million in co-funding for a unified approach to inclusive growth, bringing together small local jurisdictions for collective impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_success_factors_in_crossborder_collaboration | Challenges and Success Factors]]
The report highlights several [[challenges_and_success_factors_in_crossborder_collaboration | challenges and success factors]] in [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>:

### Challenges
*   Addressing mutual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   Navigating different administrative boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   Building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   Funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### Success Factors
*   Garnering political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   Agreeing on a common mission, strategy, and structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Building Trust and Relationships:** It's crucial to invest in relationships, as people often don't know their counterparts across borders. Building this trust makes communication and collaboration much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This is key in personal life, politics, and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.
*   **Common Goals:** A defined, concrete problem or area for collaboration is easier to start with than a broad, common understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
*   **Learning from Local Experience:** People who live and work at the border often have already found solutions or know where to find them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.
*   **Personal Touch and Human Contact:** Ultimately, [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] relies on human interaction and the social contract between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>.

## Recommendations for Action
The report offers five recommendations to foster [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>:
1.  **Securing Leadership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
2.  **Collective Vision and Strategy** among all partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
3.  **Putting in Place the Right Enablers and Dynamics** such as [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | co-funding models]] and [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | co-governance structures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
4.  **Sharing Costs and Benefits** with the understanding that equality isn't always expected, but rather a net benefit for all players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
5.  **Being a Good Partner and Building Trust** by fostering strong, long-term relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Skills for Public Servants
To develop and run [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border cooperation]], public servants need specific skills and support:
*   **Permission and Investment** Governments need to grant permission and invest in building relationships between public servants across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>.
*   **On-the-Ground Experience** Bringing public servants to the border to sit with and work with communities helps them understand and solve issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.
*   **Learning and Adaptability** Cross-border cooperation is a learned skill, not an inherent one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. It requires a readiness to change how things are done and to learn from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.
*   **Identity and Internationalism** Fostering an "internationalist" identity in public servants can encourage cooperation, especially given societal polarization and a reduction in foreign correspondents in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.
*   **Dialogue with Diverse Actors** Effective [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | collaboration]] involves dialogue not only with other governments but also with companies, NGOs, academics, and civil society, as information on innovation is broadly distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>.
*   **Carrots and Sticks** Incentives ("carrots") for collaboration are helpful, but mandatory requirements ("sticks") ingrained in law, regulation, or [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | international standards]] are often necessary to ensure systematic [[intergovernmental_cooperation_and_policy_integration | cooperation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

## Navigating Uncertainty
[[Crossborder government collaboration and innovation | Cross-border collaboration]] is vital in the face of uncertainty. Instead of turning inward, governments should embrace the reality of living with uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the necessity of working with diverse [[crossborder_government_collaboration and innovation | cross-border players]]âstates, regions, international organizations, private sector, scientists, and NGOsâto find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>. [[Crossborder collaboration]] allows for learning from others, sharing risks, and pooling resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>. Strong institutions and democratic processes are crucial for effective governance in uncertain times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.

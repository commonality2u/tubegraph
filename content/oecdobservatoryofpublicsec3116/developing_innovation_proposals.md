An innovation proposal is the process of transforming an idea into something actionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">[01:33:40]</a>. Regardless of how innovative an idea is, it needs to be developed and fit within the reality of its operating context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>. There is no single "magical answer" for what a successful proposal should look like, as it is highly dependent on the specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:44">[02:08:44]</a>.

Proposals can take various forms, from an email to a manager about a test idea to prototyping with colleagues or a formal budget proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:41">[02:20:41]</a>. Presenting an innovation proposal can be a nerve-wracking time, as it involves trying to [[rallying_support_for_innovation_ideas | rally people]] to an idea they may not be comfortable with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:20">[03:00:20]</a>.

## Tips for Successful Public Sector Innovation Proposals

### Understand the Strategic Context
It's crucial to understand the strategic context in which your idea exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:53">[03:40:53]</a>. Even the best idea won't succeed if the context isn't right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:56">[03:51:56]</a>. Consider:
*   **Related Agendas** Are there related agendas you can connect your idea to? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:58">[04:08:58]</a>
*   **Leadership Messages** Can you link your idea to political or executive leadership messages to demonstrate its importance? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:44">[04:10:44]</a>
*   **Reframing** Can you reframe your idea to better match the current context, or at least appear to do so? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:44">[04:23:44]</a>

The depth of attention given to strategic context will vary depending on the scale of the proposal, e.g., a multi-million dollar budget proposal versus a team-level idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:49">[13:21:49]</a>.

### Rally People to Your Cause
Innovation is new, so there are often no ready mental models or examples for people to reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:20">[04:41:20]</a>.
*   **Tailor Your Message** Communicate with your audience by tailoring your message to decision-makers' preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:06">[04:56:06]</a>. Do they prefer data, stories, or examples from other agencies? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>
*   **Effective Voice** Consider who will be the most effective voice for your proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:09">[05:42:09]</a>. It might be someone other than yourself who can advocate the argument more strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:09">[05:50:09]</a>.

### Don't Assume the Merits are Apparent
Novel and different ideas are easily misinterpreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:23">[06:15:23]</a>. Your personal experience or research may not be enough for others to understand its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:07">[06:27:07]</a>.
*   **Make it Real and Meaningful** Methods include:
    *   **Prototyping:** Making it visible and tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:07">[06:48:07]</a>.
    *   **Peer Voices:** Finding others who can advocate for the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:05">[06:53:05]</a>.
    *   **Concrete Use Cases:** Pointing to existing problems and how the idea has worked in other instances or jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:39">[06:56:39]</a>.
    *   **Scenario Planning:** Thinking through different future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:09">[07:15:09]</a>.

### Know Your Numbers
Have a strong sense of what you're asking for, why, and the expected results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:01">[07:31:01]</a>. Be prepared for questions, despite the higher burden of proof for innovation compared to the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:30">[07:53:30]</a>.
*   **Cost of Current Approach:** Highlight the costs and risks of continuing with the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:04">[08:21:04]</a>.
*   **Start Small:** Consider starting with a small test case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:02">[08:42:02]</a>.
*   **Promise with Confidence:** Sometimes, you need to sell the case with confidence, even with inherent uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:19">[08:54:19]</a>.
*   **External Examples:** Look for examples from other agencies, countries, or even the private sector where similar initiatives have been applied successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:02">[09:18:02]</a>.

### Be Ready for the Unexpected
Nothing is certain in innovation. Think about "what if X happens?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.
*   **Success Scenarios:** What if your proposal is approved and scales beyond initial expectations? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:48">[09:57:48]</a>
*   **New Information:** What if you learn something new that undercuts your hypothesis after approval? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:44">[10:07:44]</a>

### Maximize Your Chances
In the public sector, while "fast failure" is discussed, results are ultimately what people want to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.
*   **Learning Value:** If the idea doesn't work as hoped, what other learning can be gained? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>
*   **Relationship Building:** Can the proposal develop relationships with stakeholders or other parts of the agency? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>
*   **Multiple Payoffs:** Aim for multiple payoffs regardless of whether the primary objective is met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

### Be Open to Change
Don't try to anticipate everything; leave space for input from those receiving the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. Senior leaders often want to add their perspective and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

## Common Issues with Innovation Proposals

### Do Decision-Makers Truly Understand?
Even after getting agreement, decision-makers may be surprised or confused by the outcome of an innovative project because it's new and they might not have fully grasped the implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>. Watch for warning signs of a disconnect between what you're saying and what they expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

### Building in Flexibility
Innovation projects will inevitably encounter unexpected issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Critical Dependencies:** Don't build in critical dependencies that make you vulnerable to surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-Specificity:** Being too specific in your proposal can lead to trouble if things don't go as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>.

### Building an Escape Clause
It's important to consider how to exit a project if it doesn't go as hoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>.
*   **Stopping Failure:** In the public sector, there's a tendency to continue investing in projects even if they're not working, which is detrimental to innovative projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>.
*   **Changing Direction:** Have an exit strategy if the project deviates from your interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Over-Reliance:** Ensure the innovation isn't solely tied to you, as this makes it unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>. Consider escape avenues, even if implied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[22:05:00]</a>.

### Finding the Right Balance of Information
Avoid patronizing decision-makers, but don't assume they know everything, especially if the idea is new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:00">[22:23:00]</a>. Test your proposal with people who are deeply familiar with the issue and those who are only loosely familiar to find the right balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.

### Beware of Scope Creep
Scope creep can happen in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>:
1.  **Adding Too Much:** The project grows to include too many additional features, making it unrecognizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>.
2.  **Cutting Key Elements:** Essential parts that make the project interesting and meaningful are removed, leading to something that is no longer truly innovative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>.

It's important to be aware of and identify critical dependencies within the proposal to prevent these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges in Innovation Proposals

### Convincing Proposals Amidst Uncertainty
Innovation inherently involves uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.
*   **Cost of Status Quo:** Articulate the costs and risks of maintaining the current approach to put your idea on more equal footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.
*   **External Examples:** Leverage data and examples from similar initiatives elsewhere to provide a rough idea of costs and parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.
*   **Story Element:** Build a compelling case for why the innovation matters, sometimes prioritizing the narrative over strict procedural details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.
*   **Political Commitment:** Political or senior leadership commitment can often remove barriers and make questions about worth less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.

### Dealing with Rejection
If a proposal is rejected, even if you strongly believe in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>:
*   **Timing:** Sometimes it's the right idea at the wrong time, requiring patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.
*   **Reframing:** Reframe your idea to better suit the current context and align with political signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.
*   **Building a Coalition:** If you're too far ahead of your audience, build a coalition of supportive individuals who understand and can advocate for the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>.
*   **Outside Voices:** Find external stakeholders or organizations who can support the idea and attest to its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.
*   **Lateral Thinking:** Sometimes, it's necessary to think laterally and find alternative approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.
*   **Recognizing Limits:** Occasionally, you may need to accept that the idea won't happen in the current context and wait for a different time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.

### Managing Expectations Around Innovation
When [[government_innovation_strategies | government]] uses "innovation" as a buzzword, managing expectations, especially upwards, is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>.
*   **Common Language:** Build a shared understanding of innovation as something uncertain and uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:00">[31:06:00]</a>. If an organization is new to innovation, it may lean towards "innovation theater" without genuine interest in the "making parts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:00]</a>.
*   **External Voices:** Bring in stakeholders, partner organizations, or other public sector agencies experienced in innovative projects to help shape more realistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:08:00">[32:08:00]</a>.
*   **Political Cover:** While risky, finding key leadership who can provide political support can help manage expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>.

### Communicating Failure
Reframing "failure" is key. When testing small and things don't work, it limits exposure and allows for new tests. This is different from simply admitting a project failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>.
*   **Learning as a Goal:** In high-uncertainty situations where outcomes are unknown, learning should be a goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>.
*   **Nuance Success and Failure:** Recognize that the line between success and failure can be thin, and external events can influence outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a>. There are many shades of both success and failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple Payoffs:** Ensure every effort can yield multiple payoffs, even if the primary objective isn't met, to help avoid the term "failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:00]</a>.

## Getting Started with Innovation Proposals

### First Steps
*   **Problem Framing:** Start by correctly framing the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Low-Fidelity Testing:** Utilize low or no-cost tests in a low-fidelity manner to get feedback and uncover new insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a>. This can include:
    *   Wireframes of a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:00">[25:22:00]</a>.
    *   Playing out service interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>.
    *   Mocking up ideas on paper (e.g., using duct tape and paper for a thermostat display) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>.
*   **Validate Hypotheses:** Test and validate hypotheses before moving to the proposal stage to strengthen your proposal and gain hands-on experience without risking your organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>.
*   **Know Your Context:** Understand that the context for [[innovation_strategies | innovation strategies]] differs significantly across countries and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:00">[26:54:00]</a>.
*   **Start Small:** If new to innovation or an environment, start small with experiments within your own job context where you have discretion and don't need permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:00">[28:25:00]</a>. This builds confidence, which is important for successfully pitching ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>.

An innovation proposal transforms an idea into something actionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:45">[01:33:45]</a>. Regardless of how innovative an idea is, it needs development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Whether it's a personal test idea or a government-wide initiative, better results come from aligning the idea with the real-world context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

While there's no single "magical answer" for what a successful innovation proposal looks like, commonalities exist across various formats, from an email to a manager to an official budget proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Successful Proposals

Developing proposals can be nerve-wracking, as it involves rallying people to potentially uncomfortable new ideas and seeking validation or resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

### 1. Understand the Strategic Context
It's crucial to understand the strategic environment where your idea is emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Even the best idea won't succeed if the context isn't right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

Consider:
*   **Related Agendas**: Are there existing agendas you can connect your idea to? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>
*   **Leadership Messages**: Can you link your idea to political or executive leadership messages to show its importance? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>
*   **Reframing**: Can you frame or reframe your idea to better align with the current context, or at least appear to? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>

### 2. Rally People to Your Cause
Innovation is new, so people may not have ready mental models or examples for your idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Effective communication tailored to your audience is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

Tips for [[engaging_stakeholders_in_innovation | rallying people]]:
*   **Tailor the Message**: Adapt your message to fit decision-makers' preferences (e.g., data-focused, story-driven, or precedent-based) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Identify the Right Voice**: Consider if you are the most effective voice for the proposal, or if someone else might advocate for it more strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

### 3. Make Your Idea Real and Meaningful
Do not assume the merits of your idea are obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Novel ideas are easily misinterpreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. Personal experience or research may not be enough for others to grasp its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

Ways to make it real:
*   **Prototyping**: Make it visible and tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
*   **Peer Voices**: Find others who can help sell the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.
*   **Concrete Use Cases**: Highlight current problems and how your solution has worked in similar instances or other jurisdictions/private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **Scenario Planning**: Think about different future scenarios and how your idea plays out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

### 4. Know Your Numbers
Have a strong understanding of what you're asking for, why, and the expected results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. While many prefer certainty, especially in the public sector, innovation is inherently uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. The burden of proof for innovation is higher than for the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

Consider:
*   **Cost of Current Approach**: What are the costs and risks of continuing with the status quo? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>
*   **Start Small**: Can you begin with a small test case? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>
*   **Confidence**: Sometimes, you must promise with confidence, even if the future is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

### 5. Be Ready for the Unexpected
Anticipate what might happen ("What if X happens?") and what you will do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. Be prepared if your proposal is highly successful and scaled, or if new information undercuts your hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

### 6. Maximize Your Chances
While "fast failure" is discussed in innovation, the public sector often seeks results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

Strategies to [[innovation_strategies | demonstrate value]] and get learning:
*   **Learning as Value**: Even if the idea doesn't work as expected, what can you learn that is beneficial? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>
*   **Relationship Building**: Can the proposal help develop relationships with other players, stakeholders, or parts of your agency? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>
*   **Multiple Payoffs**: Think about how your effort can deliver multiple payoffs regardless of its primary success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

### 7. Be Open to Change
Don't try to anticipate everything; leave room for input from those receiving the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. Managers often want to add their perspective and experience, not just sign off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

## Common Issues with Innovation Proposals

### 1. Decision-Makers' Understanding
Decision-makers might not fully grasp what they've agreed to, even if you've clearly explained it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>. Innovation is new, so they might not hear what you intend or expect different outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. Watch for warning signs of this disconnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>.

### 2. Lack of Flexibility
Innovation will inevitably encounter unexpected issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. Avoid building in critical dependencies that leave you vulnerable to surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>. Being overly specific in your proposal can be problematic if things don't go as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>.

### 3. No Escape Clause
It's important to consider how to exit a project if it doesn't work as hoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>. Public sector projects often continue even if they're not working, leading to continued investment in bad ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. An escape clause also helps if the project deviates from your interests or if it becomes solely dependent on you for long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>.

### 4. Finding the Right Balance of Information
Avoid patronizing decision-makers, but don't assume they know everything about a new idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:00">[22:23:00]</a>. Test your proposal with diverse audiences (deeply familiar and loosely familiar) to ensure it hits the right mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.

### 5. Beware of Scope Creep
Scope creep can manifest in two ways:
*   **Expansion**: The project becomes unrecognizable by adding too many features or unrelated elements, making it dangerous for an innovation meant to test key things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>.
*   **Dilution**: The project is cut down to remove the innovative, meaningful parts, leaving something that no longer fulfills its original purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>.

Identify critical dependencies within the proposal and make decision-makers aware of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges in Innovation Proposals

### Overcoming Challenges in [[overcoming_challenges_in_innovation_proposals | Innovation Proposals]]

#### Dealing with Uncertainty in Impact
Innovation's impact is often uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.
*   **Cost of Status Quo**: Highlight the costs of maintaining the current approach to put your idea on more equal footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.
*   **External Examples**: Refer to examples from other organizations or countries to provide data on costs or parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.
*   **Story Element**: Build a compelling case that emphasizes why the idea matters more than procedural details or risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.
*   **Political Cover**: If there's strong political or senior leadership commitment, many barriers and questions about worth can become less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:16]</a>.

#### Responding to Rejection
If a proposal is rejected despite your belief in it:
*   **Timing**: It might be the wrong time; sometimes, waiting is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.
*   **Reframe**: Reframe your idea to better suit the current context, listening to political signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.
*   **Build Coalition**: If you're too far ahead of your audience, build a coalition of supportive individuals who understand and can make the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>.
*   **Outside Voices**: Bring in external stakeholders or experts who appreciate the idea and can advocate for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.
*   **Lateral Thinking**: Sometimes, you need to find workarounds or different pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.
*   **Know Your Limits**: Develop personal strategies for when to persist or give up. Ask questions to understand why your idea isn't valued by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:44:00">[33:44:00]</a>.
*   **Find Other Sponsors**: If your direct management is too busy, seek other sponsors who can champion the idea, understanding this carries risks with your immediate line manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>.

#### Communicating Failure
Government often struggles with discussing failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>.
*   **Reframe Failure**: Reframe it as learning, especially when starting small and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>. If you limit exposure, a non-working hypothesis becomes a valuable lesson, not a complete failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:18:00">[36:18:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple Goals**: Have more than one goal, with learning being a key objective, especially in high uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>.
*   **Nuance Success and Failure**: Recognize that success and failure are often nuanced, with many shades in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>. External, unrelated events can sometimes turn a perceived failure into a success due to chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:00">[37:51:00]</a>.
*   **Deliver Value**: Ensure every effort delivers some value, even if the primary objective isn't met, to maximize your chances of avoiding the "failure" label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>.

## Getting Started with Innovation

### 1. Low-Fidelity Testing and Prototyping
To understand the time element and reduce uncertainty, use prototyping and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>. This can range from a website wireframe to role-playing service interactions, providing information on steps and dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>. This helps flesh out the reality of the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:58:00">[25:58:00]</a>.
Example: The Nest thermostat started with duct tape and paper to test display and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>.

### 2. Start Small
Begin with low or no-risk tests to validate hypotheses before a formal proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:17]</a>. This strengthens your proposal and allows hands-on experience without putting your organization at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>.

### 3. Building Confidence
If new to innovation or your organization, start small with what you are comfortable pushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:00">[28:23:00]</a>. Everyone has some discretion in their job to experiment with how they work without seeking permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:46:00">[28:46:00]</a>. Building confidence through small successes can help with pitching ideas more confidently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>.

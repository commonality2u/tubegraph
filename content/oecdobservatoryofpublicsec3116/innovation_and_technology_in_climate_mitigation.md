The launch of the report "Harnessing [[Mission governance in achieving climate targets | Mission Governance]] to Achieve National Climate Targets" highlights the critical role of [[Innovation challenges and strategies | innovation]] and technology in [[addressing climate change | climate mitigation]] efforts globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The report, a collaboration between the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector [[Government innovation and adaptation | Innovation]] (OPSI) and the Mission Action Lab, analyzes net-zero policies in 15 countries to identify gaps and strategies for strengthening climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Current Landscape and Progress

Significant progress has been made in clean energy markets, driven by government policies and market realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Global investment in renewables and low-carbon technologies reached $2 trillion USD last year, doubling the amount spent on fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Approximately 40 countries have successfully decoupled emissions from GDP growth, demonstrating that climate action does not impede economic expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

[[Innovation as a response to societal challenges | Innovation]] has fueled substantial advancements over the past two decades, not only in research but also in tangible products. Prices for batteries, solar, and wind power have decreased rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that roughly 35% of the necessary CO2 emission reductions by 2050 will come from technologies not yet commercially available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. Investment in green startups has also seen a significant increase since the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

An OECD/UNDP report, "Investing in Climate for Growth and Development," provides economic evidence that stronger climate action boosts economic growth, projecting a net gain of 0.2% in global GDP by 2040 and potentially up to 13% of GDP growth by 2100 when accounting for avoided climate damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges in addressing climate change | Challenges in Climate Mitigation]]

Despite progress, the momentum for climate action is at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. The pace of climate policy adoption and strengthening has slowed to 1-2% per year, down from 10% annually in previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. Slower global growth, geopolitical tensions, and rising public debt are straining government budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Other significant challenges include:

*   **Shifting Priorities**: Government priorities are shifting, leading to pushback from some sectors (e.g., agriculture in Europe), risking a decline in public and political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Perception**: A persistent perception that climate action reduces economic opportunities or that the net-zero transition is not investable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Insufficient Innovation Pace**: The current pace of [[Innovation challenges and strategies | innovation]] is inadequate to meet carbon neutrality goals, with climate-related patent filings decreasing as a share of all patenting over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Incremental Innovation**: Efforts are concentrating on incremental [[Innovation challenges and strategies | innovation]] and deploying existing technologies rather than investing in R&D for entirely new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
*   **[[Challenges and solutions in climate policy governance | Polarization]]**: Climate change and policy are increasingly politicized, hindering decarbonization progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
*   **Harder-to-Abate Sectors**: Less progress has been made in sectors like agriculture and food, indicating a disconnect between science and policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.
*   **Weak Governance**: Inadequate channels in government for ensuring climate policy is informed by science and engages stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
*   **Short Time Horizons**: Government policy is often constrained by short election cycles, leading to policy "flip-flops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.
*   **Siloed Responsibility**: Climate policy is often seen as the sole responsibility of "climate people" rather than a cross-cutting, whole-of-government endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.
*   **Implementation Gaps**: Slow implementation due to bureaucratic inefficiencies, capacity constraints at local levels, narrow KPIs, and siloed budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Public Engagement**: Public consultation and engagement are often insufficient, risking backlash and negative impacts on vulnerable communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:18:00">[24:18:00]</a>.
*   **"STI Trap"**: Many innovation-focused missions, while fostering collaboration, remain primarily innovation-driven rather than truly transformative, failing to mobilize a broad range of policy instruments beyond science, technology, and [[Innovation challenges and strategies | innovation]] (STI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:55:00">[35:55:00]</a>.

## The Promise of [[Mission governance in achieving climate targets | Mission Governance]]

[[Innovation as a response to societal challenges | Innovation]] is not a silver bullet, but it is a key driver for achieving net-zero targets when combined with complementary changes in skills, infrastructure, regulations, and mobility patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. To overcome existing challenges, [[Government innovation and adaptation | government innovation]] must be integrated into broader climate commitments, with [[Mission governance in achieving climate targets | mission-oriented approaches]] playing a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

[[Mission governance in achieving climate targets | Mission governance]] is a powerful tool because it:
*   **Establishes Clear Objectives**: It anchors climate commitments within strategic planning, prioritizing mitigation and adaptation at the highest institutional levels, guiding resource allocation, and enabling stronger cross-sectoral coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. An example is the UK's dedicated cabinet committee on climate change, chaired by the Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
*   **Strengthens Capabilities**: It emphasizes building public officials' and institutions' capabilities, requiring technical expertise and adaptive policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>. Sweden's Impact [[Innovation challenges and strategies | Innovation]] Programs, for example, include an accelerator function to build public sector capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.
*   **Supports Evidence-Based Decisions**: It integrates robust data and continuous learning into governance, helping to track outcomes, understand impacts, and adapt policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. Denmark's "inomissions" explicitly integrate experimentation into mission portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.
*   **Fosters Stakeholder Engagement**: It promotes transparency and equity in climate action by incorporating participatory processes, ensuring policy decisions reflect broad societal interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>. New Zealand's Climate Change Commission has prioritized improving stakeholder engagement to enable greater societal contributions to net-zero emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.

## Integrating Missions into Climate Policy

Early missions, such as the Apollo program, focused on scientific and technological breakthroughs in defense and space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>. Today's missions, however, require systemic transformations across entire socio-technical systems, extending beyond new technologies to include skills, infrastructure, user behaviors, business models (e.g., circular economy), and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a>. This necessitates aligning STI policies with education, agriculture, transport, water, and energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.

The OECD's research on 101 net-zero missions and 17 in-depth case studies indicates that [[Mission governance in achieving climate targets | mission-oriented policies]] offer a marked improvement over traditional STI policies by fostering ambitious cross-sectoral collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>. However, their current form is insufficient to scale solutions at the required magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>.

To achieve effective transformation, [[Mission governance in achieving climate targets | mission-oriented policies]] need:
*   **Integration**: Better integration into social, behavioral, and systemic changes to ensure uptake and adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47:00">[31:47:00]</a>.
*   **Whole-of-Government Approach**: Alignment of missions with broader national climate strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:57:00">[31:57:00]</a>.
*   **Private Sector Engagement**: Stronger engagement from private sector actors to leverage investment and participation for scaling and accelerating deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:00">[32:03:00]</a>.
*   **Collaboration**: Fostering collaboration across multiple government agencies and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:10:00">[32:10:00]</a>.

### Role of Centers of Government and Climate Councils

Centers of government have become more important in navigating complex, intertwined policy issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39:00">[33:39:00]</a>. About 90% of OECD centers of government now prioritize key objectives, and over half mandate strategic plans in cross-cutting areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>. Their coordination and strategic roles position them to champion integrated policies and align sectoral actions with political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:39:00">[34:39:00]</a>.

Climate councils, such as South Africa's Presidential Climate Change Commission (chaired by the president), play a crucial role in providing scientific advice to governments and parliaments on climate policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, bridging the gap between science and policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. They can help ensure policy consistency across long time horizons and maintain political neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

The report emphasizes that mission governance should start with national climate targets, followed by specific sectoral missions and then [[Innovation challenges and strategies | mission-oriented innovation]] policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>. This whole-of-government approach requires clear commitment with timelines and dedicated mission management teams to ensure accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:55:00">[50:55:00]</a>.

### Pathways for Transition Missions

The OECD has observed and developed several scenarios for making [[Innovation challenges and strategies | innovation]] missions into real transition missions:
1.  **Gradual Broadening and Strengthening**: Missions learn by doing, building trust, improving, and broadening their scope over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:35:00">[37:35:00]</a>.
2.  **Transfer of Leadership**: Mission leadership shifts from STI authorities to the "challenge owners" (e.g., environment, transport ministries), though this can face political and budgetary competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:55:00">[37:55:00]</a>.
3.  **Dedicated Mission Agencies**: Missions are led by dedicated agencies that report to multiple ministries, like the Research Council of Norway which reports to over 15 ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>.
4.  **Elevating Missions**: Missions are led by central [[Government innovation and adaptation | government bodies]] (e.g., Prime Minister's Office or powerful transition committees), ensuring high-level political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:00">[39:12:00]</a>.
5.  **Regional/Local Missions**: Operating at a smaller, regional or local scale can alleviate governance challenges and foster stronger private stakeholder engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:00">[40:28:00]</a>. Examples include city climate contracts in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a>.

## Key Recommendations

The report makes a strong case for integrating [[Mission governance in achieving climate targets | mission governance]] principles into national climate efforts to make them systematic and concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:01:00">[57:01:00]</a>. It recommends:
*   Developing targeted missions for specific sub-targets with clear commitments and timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:12:00">[57:12:00]</a>.
*   Enabling and strengthening political support and societal engagement to ensure long-term commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:27:00">[57:27:00]</a>.
*   Enhancing [[Innovation challenges and strategies | innovation]] and experimentation in climate policy and integrating them into current actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:52:00">[57:52:00]</a>.

Ultimately, effective [[Mission governance in achieving climate targets | mission governance]] is crucial for governments to deliver effective, equitable, and sustained climate mitigation outcomes, ensuring that the critical [[addressing climate change | challenge of climate change]] remains a top political priority, not just during disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>.

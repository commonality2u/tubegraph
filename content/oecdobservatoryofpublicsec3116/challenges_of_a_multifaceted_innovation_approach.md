Public sector innovation is defined as something novel that is implemented and brings about a shift in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Innovation can vary greatly in size and certainty, and can emerge through top-down or bottom-up processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Recognizing that public sector innovation possesses [[four_facets_of_innovation | many different facets]], the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation developed a specific [[Innovation Facets Model | public sector innovation model]] to help make sense of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

## The Innovation Facets Model

The [[Innovation Facets Model | model]] is built upon two core features of innovation: how directed the process is and its level of uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. From these two axes, [[four_facets_of_innovation | four different facets of innovation]] emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>:

1.  **Enhancement-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>: This type aims to make existing products, services, and processes more effective and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. An example is using behavioural insights to encourage timely tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>.
2.  **Mission-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>: This facet focuses on solving specific problems and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>. Historical examples include sending humans to the moon, while contemporary examples involve transitioning to sustainable energy to combat climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>.
3.  **Anticipatory innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>: The goal here is to influence future developments before they become fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:05">[01:47:05]</a>. An instance of this is exploring the ethical and technological boundaries that artificial intelligence projects should adhere to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>.
4.  **Adaptive innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>: This involves exploring what is possible and discovering what could be or might be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:08">[02:02:08]</a>. The emergence of social media, for example, introduced new ways for government and citizens to interact, reshaping expectations and creating new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>.

## Challenges of an Unbalanced Innovation Approach

Given that innovation is multifaceted, there is no single "one-size-fits-all" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:43">[02:24:43]</a>. Concentrating efforts on only one or two facets means that [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation | innovation efforts will be uneven]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:05">[02:30:05]</a>, leading directly to [[overcoming_challenges_in_innovation_projects | missed opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:03">[02:36:03]</a>. To avoid these pitfalls, government requires a [[innovation portfolio management and its challenges | balanced innovation portfolio]] that covers all [[four_facets_of_innovation | innovation facets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:09">[02:41:09]</a>.

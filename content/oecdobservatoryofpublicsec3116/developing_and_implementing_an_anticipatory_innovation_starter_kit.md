From: [[oecdobservatoryofpublicsec3116]] <br/> 

The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) is developing an [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]] Starter Kit in collaboration with various countries, including Portugal and the Danish Design Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This kit aims to help public sector organizations begin their journey with [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## What is [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]]?

[[Anticipatory innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] is a key facet of OPSI's multi-faceted innovation model for the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It guides the purpose of different types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This area is often systematically underinvested in, prompting OPSI to focus additional energy on building capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

It is not enough to merely anticipate or innovate; mechanisms and structures must be put in place within governments to enable this work sustainably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This involves creating an authorizing environment and agency for [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Development Process: Portugal's Experience

LabX Portugal has been incubating the [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]] Starter Kit in collaboration with OPSI, supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The project aims to provide a practical approach to [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]], translating concepts into actionable solutions for public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Identifying Problems from Users

The development began by understanding the real problems on the ground through cross-sourcing from potential users, including experts and public managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Four major issues were detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>:

*   **Uneasiness with Future Uncertainty** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>: People avoid thinking about uncertainty or try to repress it through prescriptions and idealized future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Sense of Urgency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>: Public managers are constantly dealing with day-to-day issues, making it difficult to grasp future horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This often leads to relying on past routines and habits, perpetuating outdated solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Helplessness Regarding Futures Work** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>: Some managers feel isolated when trying to implement foresight or new trends into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. There is a need to help them translate their needs and willingness into practical, actionable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Feeble Interest and Skills Among Practitioners** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>: Without a taste of what [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] offers, there's little demand for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Raising awareness and making it accessible is crucial to generate interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Design Principles for the Starter Kit

The workshops helped establish basic design principles for the kit to address these problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>:

*   **Problem-Based** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>: It should solve real problems, translate them into challenges, and provide tools for people to tackle them independently, building their own capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **User-Friendly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>: Designed for beginners or public managers who have heard about [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] but need help getting started or disseminating practices within their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. It should support a "do-it-yourself" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Actionable and Adaptable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>: It should not be a mere replication but something that can be recontextualized and adapted to specific needs, bringing real changes and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. It should avoid esoteric terms and focus on practical application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Structure of the Starter Kit

The starter kit has three main areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>:

1.  **Pit of Problems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>: Helps users translate their problems into challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
2.  **Challenges** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>: These could involve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>:
    *   Producing/imagining alternative futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
    *   Envisioning a new organizational vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
    *   Setting a concrete strategy to attain goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
    *   Understanding the drivers of change surrounding their organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
3.  **Tools** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>: Each challenge area has different tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

The incubator program aims to stress-test and improve this architecture for a better version by November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## International Ambitions

OPSI is working in parallel with the Danish Design Center on a more international version of the [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]] Starter Kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Lessons learned from the experimental approach of the Portugal project will be applied more broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The goal is to provide a valuable pool of resources for people globally seeking to get started with [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] and [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | strategic foresight]] in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

## [[barriers_to_getting_started_with_anticipatory_innovation | Barriers to Getting Started with Anticipatory Innovation]]

Based on OPSI's work and global experience with [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | strategic foresight]], five broad areas of [[barriers_to_getting_started_with_anticipatory_innovation | barriers]] (the "Five C's") contribute to an "impact gap," where excellent futures thinking doesn't lead to implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>:

*   **Competency Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>: [[Role of Strategic Foresight in Anticipatory Innovation | Strategic foresight]] practice is not systematically embedded across governments, often existing only in pockets of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
*   **Cultural Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>: Unreasonable expectations that [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | strategic foresight]] will reveal the future like an oracle, rather than providing knowledge in an imperfect and constantly changing future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>: Humans struggle with complexity, uncertainty, and exponentiality, leading to avoidance of uncertainty, groupthink, recency/availability bias, and a lack of imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Corporate Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>: Organizations may cling to implicit, outdated "zombie futures" that are not in step with a fast-changing reality, hindering their ability to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.
*   **Communication Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>: Different perceptions of the future within an organization, if left implicit, can lead to surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. [[Role of Strategic Foresight in Anticipatory Innovation | Strategic foresight]] can help bring people together around shared narratives and constructive disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.

In Chile, fragmented small initiatives lack the political agreement, funding, and multidisciplinary technical skills needed to coordinate a system of [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. Less than 20% of public funding for science, knowledge, technology, and innovation is invested in organized future-facing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.

In Denmark, while public sector innovation is deeply embedded and common, the focus tends to be on [[adaptive_and_anticipatory_innovation_strategies | adaptive innovation]] and enhancement (bottom-up, close to citizens), with [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory]] and mission-oriented innovation being weaker spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

In Slovenia, the focus is on "learning by doing" through concrete cases due to the lack of an overarching system for [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>. The need for consistent funding and training is highlighted, as support can fluctuate with changing governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

## Needs of Civil Servants to Embrace [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]]

Civil servants wishing to engage with [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] need support to address the identified [[barriers_to_getting_started_with_anticipatory_innovation | barriers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.

Key characteristics and needs include:
*   **Motivation and Soft Skills:** Willingness to improve, motivation, and soft skills like collaboration and co-creation are crucial starting points, especially in bottom-up initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
*   **Practical Tools and Support:** Access to projects and funds dedicated to trainings and expert help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
*   **Safe Environment:** A supportive environment is needed to embed tools and systems, ensuring the work doesn't solely depend on individual willingness but is part of a broader system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.
*   **Stimulation of Abilities:** Encouraging imagination, boldness, and prospection through practical engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.
*   **Questioning Mindset:** The ability to question established patterns and comfortable situations is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.

## Features of an Effective Starter Kit

To improve the chance of adoption, a starter kit should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>:
*   **Be User-Centric:** Engage users in the development process to ensure relevance and value, as kits irrelevant to users will not be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>.
*   **Be Tangible and Concrete:** Avoid being too abstract, ensuring it adds value for people solving immediate problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.
*   **Clearly Define Use Cases:** Specify when and in which situations the toolkit is the right one to use, and how it connects to other tools and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>.
*   **Target Specific Audiences:** This particular kit targets beginners – public managers and civil servants who have heard about [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] but need an accessible starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>.

## Limitations of a Toolkit

A starter kit is not a panacea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a> and its benefits are not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. It's an option among others, depending on the context and detected needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.

*   **Not an Answer Provider:** The toolkit is a platform for asking questions, not for providing definitive answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. It should prevent jumping to conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.
*   **Initiates a Process:** It is intended to start a process of "learning by doing" and capacity building within organizations, which takes time and sustained effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.
*   **Not Prescriptive:** It should be a modular, adaptable solution rather than a rigid recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. Users should feel free to upgrade or discard parts as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
*   **Does Not Solve Problems on its Own:** [[Anticipatory innovation | Anticipation]] and [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | strategic foresight]] must lead to action and implementation; they enlarge but cannot complete the picture for decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.
*   **Requires Purpose-Driven Work:** Successful [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipation]] avoids excessive gathering and pondering of signals at the expense of relevant selection, sense-making, strategic reframing, and generation of ideas for concrete innovation and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>.

The function of the toolkit is not to make us believe in magical future creatures, but to believe that if something appears in the future, we have hope to "kill it or tame it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.

## The Role of Politics and Values

[[Anticipatory innovation_and_governance | Anticipatory innovation]] inherently involves affecting public values and dealing with high uncertainty about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>.

*   **Engaging Politicians:** Politicians represent desired futures and societies, and their engagement is vital in this work, especially when discussing desired futures and societal values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.
*   **Defining Opportunities and Risks:** The political aspect involves deciding which portions of future scenarios are considered opportunities or risks, which is a personal question requiring political agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>.
*   **Public Good Scenarios:** One approach is to offer scenarios as a public good, allowing politicians, the productive sector, and academia to respond based on their own values and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
*   **Addressing Political Cycles:** The long time scales of future problems clash with shorter political cycles (three to five years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>. Challenges include gaining leadership buy-in and consistent political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   **Challenging Linear Thinking:** [[Role of Strategic Foresight in Anticipatory Innovation | Foresight]] practitioners face the challenge of introducing less linear ways of thinking about the future into political discourse, often dominated by economic disciplines focused on short-term decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.
*   **Communicating Uncomfortable Knowledge:** It is the responsibility of practitioners to communicate "uncomfortable knowledge" about the future to decision-makers, even if it's not immediately attention-grabbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.

Ultimately, communicating results, remaining motivated, and implementing solutions are key to spreading belief in a new culture that embraces thinking about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

## Next Steps

OPSI will continue to support LabX Portugal with its incubator project for the [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]] Starter Kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>. Parallel work is ongoing with the Danish Design Center to create an international version of the kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Further information on OPSI's work in [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] and other facets of public sector innovation is available on their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>.

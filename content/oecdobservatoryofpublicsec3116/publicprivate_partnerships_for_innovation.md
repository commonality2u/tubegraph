Innovation is crucial for addressing global challenges, particularly in the developing world, and requires collaborative efforts from various stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated poverty and inequality worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for innovations that benefit the poorest and most vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## The Role of Governments in Fostering Innovation
Governments play a critical role in creating an enabling environment for successful innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Instead of controlling, their function should be to coordinate, facilitate, and nurture innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This means steering rather than rowing, allowing others to drive the primary activities of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

Key governmental actions include:
*   **Creating Ecosystems:** Establishing environments where innovation can thrive, including regulations, opportunities, and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This involves fostering an "innovation sandbox" with funding and mentorship for local innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Nurturing and Facilitating:** Governments can help nurture both the generation of varied ideas (experiments) and the selection and scaling of promising innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. They can identify "positive deviants" – outliers with effective solutions – and provide resources to scale them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Digital Platforms:** Governments can create digital platforms to bring together innovators, organizations, and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Strategic Procurement:** Government procurement can be a powerful incentive to align the efforts of various actors, including private companies and startups, toward solving identified problems like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **Incentivizing Private Sector Involvement:** Providing incentives and disincentives to encourage private sector participation in national development and citizen welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. This includes leveraging the private sector for upskilling and reskilling programs to address unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.

## The Role of the Private Sector
The private sector has a significant role in innovation, encompassing large multinational corporations and agile startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.
*   **Shifting Focus:** Traditionally, corporate innovation has been expensive, technology-driven, and focused on affluent markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. This approach needs to change, with companies prioritizing solutions for low-income groups and emerging markets, where needs are often unmet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **Frugal Innovation:** This approach emphasizes "doing more and better for more people with less resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. It involves understanding specific needs and repurposing existing resources to create affordable, inclusive solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.
*   **Partnerships with Startups:** Large companies can partner with startups that develop early-stage ideas, providing the resources, expertise, and distribution networks to scale these innovations rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.

## The COVID-19 Crisis and Innovation
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both the potential and the unmet needs for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>.
*   **Adaptation and Repurposing:** The crisis has shown the value of repurposing or adapting existing capabilities and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
    *   USAID had previously invested in the mHero two-way communication platform in Liberia during the Ebola outbreak, which proved invaluable for sharing COVID-19 information with frontline health workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
    *   Makerspaces in India repurposed materials like transparency sheets to quickly produce face masks for frontline workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
    *   Existing infrastructure like train compartments and stadia were repurposed into mobile wards or pop-up hospitals for patient care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
    *   Low-cost, existing drugs like dexamethasone have been repurposed to treat COVID-19 symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
    *   Financial instruments, such as Islamic social financing models (e.g., Sukuk bonds), are being experimented with to empower local women and communities, linking financial innovation to health and livelihood development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Challenges:** Challenges include navigating regulatory hurdles, managing behavioral change, and coordinating stakeholders to deploy innovations at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. Economic recessions and capital outflows from low- and middle-income countries also pose significant financial constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.
*   **Cross-sectoral Needs:** The pandemic highlights the need for [[Publicprivate partnerships in innovation | innovation]] not just in health, but across humanitarian, development, and financial sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.
*   **Importance of Local Solutions:** Many innovations should be local and context-specific, allowing for adaptation to specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. An example is the Project Last Mile partnership in South Africa, which enabled local manufacturers in the Western Cape to produce textile masks for their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

## Ideal Dynamics for Collaborative Innovation
The ideal dynamic between governments, corporations, and citizens involves:
*   **Citizen as Co-designers:** Recognizing that innovators are often the people themselves living in communities facing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Citizens and grassroots innovators are the "rowers" who experiment and generate early-stage ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
*   **Government as Steer:** Governments should "steer" by creating the ecosystem, setting priorities (like SDGs), and providing incentives and regulatory sandboxes for experimentation and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.
*   **Corporations as Scalers:** Powerful corporations, especially large ones, should partner with smaller, agile startups or grassroots innovators to select promising ideas and provide the resources (expertise, funding, distribution) to scale them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.
*   **Risk-Taking:** Donors and governments must be willing to take risks to support locally driven [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. This includes using patient capital like grants to lower risk for return-seeking investors, thereby growing the resource pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.
*   **Holistic and Inclusive Approach:** Moving beyond traditional silos in the development sector and considering broader impacts across economic, social, and environmental areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. This also means actively encouraging a diverse range of innovators, including female and locally based innovators, who may not be on the traditional radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

By fostering these [[publicprivate_partnerships_in_innovation | public-private partnerships]], the international community can better design and target support to enable local solutions and innovators in addressing the SDGs, particularly in reducing poverty and inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

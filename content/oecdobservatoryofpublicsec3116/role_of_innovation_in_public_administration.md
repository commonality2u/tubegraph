The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly highlighted the critical [[Role of innovation in public administration | role of innovation in public administration]], revealing both unpreparedness and surprising agility within governments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The crisis underscored the importance of learning about existing systems and looking within for opportunities for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### The Pandemic as a Catalyst for Change

The pandemic has served as a real stress test for state administrations, examining processes, information flow, and the competencies of civil servants and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. It has exposed existing inequalities, increased unemployment, weakened economies, and revealed an absence of policies for such pandemics, along with the fragility of health systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

However, the crisis also presented an opportunity for governments to discover capabilities within themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For many, it confirmed the dedication of public administration professionals who share a strong sense of public duty and values like solidarity, empathy, collaboration, and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

### Key Areas and Principles of Innovation

Governments have learned that there is "no room to fail" when safeguarding society's well-being and economy, requiring the building of capacity for action regardless of challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. It necessitates ceasing to solve new problems with old solutions, advocating for the capability to identify unforeseen challenges, build scenarios, and replace reaction with proactiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

Key areas where [[Innovation in public administration | innovation]] has proven crucial include:

*   **Digitalization** Investments in digitalization of e-services and the development of e-government were vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of online services, including government meetings and parliamentary sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. Portugal's long-standing "Simplex" program, focused on digital services and administrative simplification, proved its worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
*   **Rapid Response Mechanisms** Science laboratories, for example, assisted in creating and adopting innovative response mechanisms to address the spread of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Georgia implemented innovative solutions like hotlines and databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   **Workplace Redefinition** The crisis forced a redefinition of the workplace, with many public workers migrating to remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. A survey in Slovenia revealed that 45% of civil servants found their efficiency higher while teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This shift is likely to be sustainable, with employees now preferring a combination of remote and office work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
*   **Debureaucratization and Responsibility** Achieving agility requires an internal debureaucratization of the system, which in turn demands greater responsibility for decision-making from civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. This fosters self-organization, previously more common in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Collaboration and Trust** Collaboration is seen as key to balancing agility and thoroughness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
    *   **Collaboration with Citizens and Civil Society** This reinforces trust through information and active participation, empowering citizens to act, defend rights, and comply with measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. Transparency and communication played a significant role in building public trust and legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
    *   **Collaboration between Public Sector Organizations** Sharing knowledge and data, fostering interoperability and service integration using technology, allows for informed choices and prompt reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. The crisis highlighted the interconnectedness of all public service layers, reinforcing the need for unified cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.
    *   **International Cooperation** This allows countries to tackle shared challenges like the pandemic and keep economies running across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Examples include the African Medical Supplies Portal, which served as a continental marketplace for critical medical supplies, testing the Africa Free Trade Agreement in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>.

### Strategic Vision for the Future

Moving forward, the focus for [[Innovation in public administration | innovation in public administration]] includes:

*   **Investing in People:** Empowering public workers and developing their skills and leadership to adopt new organizational and working models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. This includes enabling continuous education and attracting and retaining talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>.
*   **Developing Management Capacity:** Emphasizing simplification, [[Innovation in public administration | innovation]], and collaborative work models, ensuring decision-making uses data and knowledge across silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.
*   **Exploring Technology:** Pushing for global technology government, improving interoperability and service integration, and managing data ecosystems safely and transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.
*   **Reinforced Proximity:** Ensuring that even with digitalization, public services remain close to citizens in all territories, fostering inclusiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.

The pandemic has set new, higher standards for public administration, demanding greater transparency, communication, and proactive actions from governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. The shift to remote work presents a new challenge for human resource managers and leaders to inspire and motivate public servants in a "new normal" routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>. Overall, this crisis has demonstrated that public administration can operate in different ways, presenting an opportunity for the renovation of democracy, policymaking, and service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.

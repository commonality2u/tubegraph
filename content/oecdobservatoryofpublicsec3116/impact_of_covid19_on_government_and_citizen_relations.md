The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly highlighted the crucial importance of public trust for the effectiveness of public policies, whether concerning compliance with restrictions or the uptake of vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. During the crisis, public services were adapted, often utilizing digital technologies to ensure citizen safety and meet their expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Importance of Public Trust
Trust in institutions is fundamentally driven by the responsiveness and reliability of services, as well as perceptions of their fairness, openness, and integrity, a concept known as the OECD trust framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Governments that held higher levels of trust at the pandemic's outset demonstrated greater adoption of health behaviors and pro-social behaviors among their populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Key lessons for building trust include:
*   **Communication**: Governments that communicate timely and clearly about necessary actions, even difficult ones, see citizens follow guidelines and an increase in the perception of government performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Telling difficult truths can be more effective than downplaying a crisis, as seen in cases like Denmark compared to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. Simplified communication, avoiding overly technical vocabulary, also aids in reaching the general population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
*   **Governmental and Interpersonal Trust**: Both are vital. When citizens believe the government cares about them and is taking appropriate actions, trust is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   **Local Focus**: The local level, including local leaders and community-based policies, is fundamental to building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. Initiatives at this level, such as local nurses inviting people to vaccinate in Bangladesh, have shown success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Challenges to Government-Citizen Relations
The pandemic has, in many contexts, increased distance and polarization between citizens and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

### Polarization and Misinformation
Societies have become more split, often along lines like "pro-vaccine" or "anti-vaccine," making it challenging to find common ground and communication strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The spread of misinformation, particularly via social media, complicates public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. This means decisions risk becoming reactive rather than proactive and strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. Governments face a challenge in balancing freedom of speech with preventing the spread of fake stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Perceived Distance and Political Efficacy
Research in Spain indicated that the COVID-19 crisis increased the distance between citizens and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Both external political efficacy (citizens' perception of how open the political system is to their needs) and internal political efficacy (citizens' capacity to participate or influence politics) declined between August 2020 and June 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

### Gender Inequality
A significant [[impact_of_crisis_on_public_trust_and_governance | impact of the crisis on public trust and governance]] observed is the disproportionate effect on women. Women's levels of political efficacy, already lower, decreased more than men's, especially internal efficacy, widening the gender gap in political involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. The pandemic highlights inclusiveness as a major cross-cutting challenge to avoid such disproportionate effects on certain population sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Digitalization: Opportunities and Risks
Digitalization presents both opportunities and [[challenges_faced_by_governments_in_the_covid19_crisis | challenges faced by governments in the COVID-19 crisis]].

### Benefits
Digitalization has allowed governments to continue delivering public services efficiently, even transforming quickly to fully digital operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. For example, Latvia rapidly implemented digital systems for state revenue service to provide benefits to those out of jobs, enabling quick access to funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. It also offers a cost-free way to incorporate citizens into political discussions, as it doesn't require significant time commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

### Challenges
*   **Digital Divide**: Digitalization can create a gap between citizens and government and exacerbate existing inequalities, leaving vulnerable groups (e.g., indigenous people, elderly) behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. If not well-designed, inclusive or co-creative participation mechanisms risk replicating these inequalities online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.
*   **Misinformation**: Social media, while bringing government closer to citizens, also allows everyone to be a "media" outlet, making it difficult to distinguish facts from opinions or "story discussions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

## Moving Forward: Building Inclusive Governance
To foster better relations and stronger trust, governments need to adopt new approaches and a long-term vision.

### Humble and Collaborative Leadership
A "humble government" involves:
1.  Acknowledging what it doesn't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>.
2.  Accepting that there are unknown areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>.
3.  Publicly recognizing these knowledge gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.
4.  Having the humility to ask for help from citizens and other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

This implies listening more, asking more, and working together rather than issuing orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. There is a need for new leaders with skills in flexibility and collaboration across different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>. Governments should also move away from working in silos and enhance coordination between different ministries and levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.

### Rethinking Policy Making
Traditional, rigid policy-making processes, as taught in public administration, need to evolve. Governments should embrace a diverse toolbox of instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.

New approaches include:
*   **Design Thinking**: This method involves designing policy-making processes around the people who use and serve the policies, fostering collaboration among all stakeholders. Once experienced, it becomes difficult to revert to old methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Bottom-Up Approach**: Instead of top-down mechanism design, governments should identify and leverage existing community engagement methods and citizen interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
*   **Continuous Feedback Loops**: Service design should be a continuous process where feedback from users is collected and integrated to adapt and improve services over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
*   **Empowering Public Employees**: Recognizing and empowering public employees, giving them ownership, and engaging them in policy design and implementation can improve governmental performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.

### Innovative Tools and Techniques
*   **"1+2+4" Facilitation**: This discussion method involves individual reflection (1), then discussion in pairs (2), followed by larger group discussions (4). It ensures participants feel their opinions are valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **Empathy Maps**: Asking stakeholder groups to describe what they believe *other* groups think about them can reveal profound misunderstandings and foster empathy, serving as a turning point for building trust in discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

### Accountability
There is a call for greater accountability for politicians' actions beyond their term, establishing legal mechanisms that encourage long-term policy decisions rather than short-term gains driven by election cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

The [[pandemic_impact_on_government_practices | pandemic impact on government practices]] has highlighted existing problems and revealed new [[challenges_faced_by_governments_during_the_pandemic | challenges faced by governments during the pandemic]] regarding trust and public engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. This critical moment offers an opportunity to reflect on past experiences, streamline positive [[pandemicinduced_changes_in_government_operations | pandemic-induced changes in government operations]], and build more inclusive and future-oriented public governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

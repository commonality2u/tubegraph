Governments of the 20th century were designed to operate in predictable environments with established routines and available knowledge bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that stability is fictional and the future can be highly uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. In such circumstances, governments cannot stand still; the cost of late action or inaction can be severely high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Thus, governments must be ready to embrace uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Key Challenges for Modern Governance

Current challenges are global, complex, and deeply systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The existing system is "perfectly designed for the outcomes we're currently getting," revealing serious vulnerabilities in areas like global value chains, resource management, food, and biodiversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Humanity faces hard deadlines imposed by planetary boundaries, particularly during the "decisive decade" for climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The biggest risk is "doing too little too late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Aaron Maniam from Singapore's Ministry of Communications and Information suggests that the idea of "normal" is a myth, and societies are entering a "never normal" situation of continuous fluidity, flux, and turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. He argues against using a "war" metaphor for challenges like pandemics, as there is no clear enemy or finite endpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Instead, the virus should be seen as part of an ecology or natural living ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This highlights biological and moral interdependence, emphasizing that individualistic tendencies are problematic and that societies need to help the most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Olli-Pekka Heinonen from Finland's National Agency for Education identifies two competing worldviews:
1.  **The "Control" Worldview:** Assumes knowing the future, having right answers, making plans, and acting to reach budget targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
2.  **The "Uncertainty" Worldview:** Acknowledges that there are no "right answers" and emphasizes that continuous learning is essential, especially emergent learning where "best" constantly changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Shifting Paradigms for Governance

To navigate uncertainty, governments need to abandon the idea of fixed predictability and embrace new approaches:

*   **Prepare, Not React** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>: Instead of just reacting, governments must use tools like [[scenario_planning_and_governance|scenario planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> and invest wisely in responses that transform entire systems (e.g., production, mobility, energy, food, education, health) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This also means understanding that predicting the future is less useful than using ideas about the future to make better decisions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing Complexity**: The pandemic highlights a deeply [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance|complex and adaptive human living system]], requiring human and living solutions rather than "technical" war-like approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Questioning Assumptions**: Governments should be anchored by vision and core values, but not by specific worldviews or fixed assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Scenario planning helps by presenting futures that challenge deeply held beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Unpalatable futures, rather than unthinkable ones, are often ignored but need to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **From Performance to Capacity Management**: The focus should shift from traditional performance management to increasing the learning capacity of public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Hierarchy often hinders learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
    *   This involves several mindset shifts:
        1.  From optimization to resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
        2.  From quantitative to qualitative indicators of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
        3.  From pure focus on output to outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
        4.  From linear to exponential approaches, recognizing profound non-linear effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
        5.  From scarcity to abundance or fixed to growth mindsets, allowing for continuous learning and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>.
        6.  From stable equilibrium to iterative work, constantly adjusting and experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
        7.  From silo mentality to integration, allowing local sub-optimization for global benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

## [[Role of leadership and governance in behavioral policy|Leadership and Governance]] for the Future

The current consensus among surveyed participants indicates that governments should take a leading role in actively embracing and shaping uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. This aligns with the concept of the "entrepreneurial state" which leads investment and plays a strong facilitative role in public outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

Key aspects of [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_organization_and_governance|future-oriented governance]] and leadership include:

*   **Whole-of-Government Approach**: Moving beyond traditional hierarchies and silos to cross-agency coordination and "joined-up" work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.
*   **Whole-of-Nation Coordination**: Governments must become [[governance_and_technology_interaction|ecosystem stewards]], facilitating collaboration across multiple sectors, including private entities, community players, and active citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. They need to convene different parties to foster dialogue and aggregate interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Co-creation and [[public_trust_and_governance|Public Trust]]**: People buy into what they help create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. Governments should engage in participatory, not populist, governance, bringing citizens into deliberations about complex problems and fostering trust through shared views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. This includes [[technology_foresight_and_governance|deliberative dialogues]] to involve citizens in complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>.
*   **Learning and Experimentation**: Leaders must celebrate learning, viewing even negative results as valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. This involves risk-managed experiments, like regulatory sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   **Valuing Regenerative Approaches**: Financial risks taken by governments during crises should be linked to a regenerative approach, shaping the future rather than merely reacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. This includes discussions on how value is defined and shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Humility**: Leaders need to be open about changing positions as new evidence emerges, building trust by acknowledging that certainty is not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.
*   **[[Anticipatory governance in government and technology|Anticipatory Governance]]**: Finland has a long tradition of future work in government and parliament, utilizing scenarios to aid decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. The next step is to integrate this future approach and innovation governance more strongly into main government processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   **Polarity-Based Thinking**: Leaders need to balance competing priorities (e.g., present vs. future, micro vs. macro, slowing down vs. speeding up) by holding opposing thoughts and understanding that they are often mutually reinforcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

The goal is to move from a controlling to a facilitating state, fostering internal motivation for behavioral change through experience-based learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. Special attention must be paid to giving voice to the most vulnerable, whose lives are often most impacted by change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.

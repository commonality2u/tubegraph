Innovation plays a critical role in shaping [[supporting_innovation_for_sustainable_development | sustainable urban development]], particularly in the wake of systemic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Cities, as front-line responders to the pandemic, demonstrated remarkable agility and leadership, accelerating existing trends and revealing new opportunities for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Cities on the Front Line During COVID-19
Cities worldwide were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and found themselves on the front lines of the response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Their functions included:
*   **Containing the Virus:** Implementing nationwide measures like lockdowns, physical distancing, and mask availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Well-being:** Coordinating and continuing essential local public services such as water, sanitation, solid waste, and transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Protecting Vulnerable Groups:** Providing measures to protect the elderly, women, youth, migrants, and preventing rent evictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Supporting Local Businesses:** Aiding restaurants and local shops particularly affected by the halt in global production and consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Leading Recovery Efforts:** Contributing to recovery packages that addressed social and economic impacts, focusing on [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_digital_technology_integration_in_cities | digitalization]], green transition, and renewed social contracts between cities and residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

The [[impact_of_covid_19_on_city_planning_and_innovation | COVID-19 pandemic]] acted as a "magnifying glass," accelerating trends and urging local leaders to act on various fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Historically, pandemics have triggered rethinking in cities and new urban paradigms, such as the cholera pandemic in 19th-century Paris leading to major hygiene and sanitation works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## The New Frontier: Innovation and Digitalization
The critical new aspect of this crisis, compared to previous ones, is the role of [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] and [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_digital_technology_integration_in_cities | digitalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Massive investment in digital infrastructure allowed for a "digital proximity" to substitute physical proximity, seen in online education, telemedicine, e-commerce, and especially telework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

> "Innovation is not only technological, it's not only digital... that technological and digital innovation is essential to trigger better local public policies, better planning, better investment strategies, more [[systems_thinking_in_innovation | system thinking]] at the local level..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>

The [[impact_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation capacity of cities]] and [[evaluation_and_sustainability_in_public_sector_innovations | public sector innovation]] have gained significant traction during this period of [[Crisisdriven change and resilience in urban environments | crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Key Aspects of Urban Innovation
### Data Sharing and Multi-level Governance
Effective [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] in cities requires seamless data sharing, which is often hindered by fragmented administrative structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. In London, with 33 boroughs, coordinating responses to issues like COVID-19 that "have no respect for borough boundaries" is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. For example, sharing data on vulnerable children receiving free school meals was critical but complex due to the multitude of data-sharing relationships required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. [[Government innovation and adaptation | National government initiatives]] can fail if they do not co-design solutions with city governments, leading to wasted time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Cities need instruments and information to respond effectively, and a partnership approach between different levels of government is essential for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

### Overcoming the Fear of Failure
A significant obstacle to [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] in large organizations, including city governments, is the fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
> [!quote] Mikko Gronol
> "Unless we are prepared to make mistakes, we can't really do anything new. So the fear of failure is I think one of the biggest obstacle for true innovation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>

Helsingborg, for instance, has actively worked to tackle this by:
*   **Creating a simple structure** for employees to navigate, test ideas, and receive coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
*   **Fostering a culture of learning from mistakes**, even implementing an "internal award, the fail of the year award," to signal that mistakes are expected and valued for the lessons they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.
*   **Training managers** in managing change, transformation, and [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] to build internal capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

This approach creates a system and culture that fosters [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] in every employee, aiming to become an innovative city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.

### Political Imagination and Subjective Data
Innovation in cities goes beyond technology; it requires "political imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. This involves defining the kind of societies we want to become and creating participatory practices and collaboration not just for specific projects, but for a deeper societal vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

Objective data alone does not provide a full picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. Subjective data, reflecting how people relate to their city and society, is also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. This approach recognizes that reality is not solely objective but also composed of an "intangible infrastructure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>. While data-driven strategies are necessary, "experimental grounds need to go beyond that" to address non-linear and non-rational challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.

### The "Must-Have" Nature of Innovation
[[Innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | Innovation]] is increasingly seen as a "must-have," not a "nice-to-have," for cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. The number of Chief [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | Innovation]] Officers in US cities, for example, grew from five in 2012 to over 80 today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. This growth is driven by pioneer cities demonstrating the value of dedicating staff to stepping back from daily "fires" to rethink service delivery and achieve better resident experiences and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

During the COVID-19 [[Crisisdriven change and resilience in urban environments | crisis]], mayors and city managers with existing [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] capacity immediately leveraged it to lead emergency responses and quickly devise solutions when no playbook existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. While budgetary pressures post-crisis pose a risk, most [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] capacity in cities remains safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

### Measurable Outcomes for Well-being
To ensure the longevity of [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] efforts, it's crucial to correlate investment in [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] capacity with tangible outcomes for residents' well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. This means:
*   Starting with outcomes in mind when identifying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
*   Leveraging existing data to understand the problem's scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   Building capacity within the city to measure the impact of innovative ideas from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
This allows innovators to confirm their impact and provide convincing evidence to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

## Looking Forward: Resilient and Symbiotic Cities
Future [[sustainable_urban_development | sustainable urban development]] depends on preparing for the unexpected by building competencies, capabilities, and adaptable working methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. Instead of detailed planning, focus should be on clear, visualized goals and learning as you go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.

### Rethinking Urban Planning
The COVID-19 [[Crisisdriven change and resilience in urban environments | crisis]] has accelerated the shift from mobility to accessibility, prompting a rethinking of urban planning around people's amenities rather than just moving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. Concepts like the "10-minute city" (Brussels), "15-minute city" (Paris), and "20-minute city" (Melbourne) aim to create multi-dimensional spaces for well-being encompassing health, education, and transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

### Digital Inclusion and Hybrid Worlds
While [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_digital_technology_integration_in_cities | digitalization]] offers collaborative benefits (e.g., seamless virtual meetings), it also exacerbates digital exclusion for those without access to devices, internet, or training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. Cities must address this to prevent vulnerable populations from being excluded from education, work, and social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. The future will likely be a hybrid world, combining physical and virtual interactions, requiring cities to balance these dynamics while prioritizing digital inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.

### Multilateralism and City Diplomacy
City-to-city peer learning and international cooperation are crucial for urban [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>. Networks of mayors and city managers, such as those facilitated by Bloomberg Philanthropies, enable empathy, strong dialogue, and the sharing of solutions to common challenges, especially when higher levels of government are uncoordinated or in disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>. This "city diplomacy" allows for the replication of successful initiatives across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.

### Fortifying Public Institutions
The [[impact of COVID 19 on city planning and innovation | pandemic]] has highlighted the importance of public institutions, from health systems to [[government innovation and adaptation | government leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>. The focus should be on fortifying these institutions and prioritizing "public value" over mere efficiency, ensuring that [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovation]] is aligned with societal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.

### Citizen Engagement and Experimental Probes
The [[crisisdriven change and resilience in urban environments | crisis]] has shown that citizens, through their experiences, can become convinced of radical urban changes that previously faced resistance, such as dedicating streets to pedestrians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>. "Experimental probes" — temporary urban interventions that allow people to experience new realities — can help gain public support for positive changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

## Commitments for the Future
Panelists committed to:
*   Thinking about "symbiotic cities" where everything interpolates and understanding mutual interdependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.
*   Continuing to "fix the basics" of data sharing and ensuring proper data infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>.
*   More persistently advocating to national governments to ease policies and legislation, enabling cities to implement changes more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>.
*   Doubling down on helping cities generate and document measurable outcomes and widely share successful [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | innovations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">[01:15:58]</a>.

These commitments highlight the ongoing need for [[supporting_innovation_for_sustainable_development | innovation to build back better]] and foster resilient, equitable, and [[sustainable_urban_development | sustainable urban development]] in the post-pandemic era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

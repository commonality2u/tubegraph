The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) focuses on tools, methods, and capabilities for [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This includes the development of the portfolio exploration tool, a project worked on by the OPSI team for over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Portfolio approaches are considered essential to steward [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Understanding Innovation: The OPSI Facets Model

OPSI works with different types of [[types_and_purposes_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] through its Innovation Facets Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Public sector organizations inherently have [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] portfolios, even if they are not explicitly acknowledged or stewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The model categorizes [[types_and_purposes_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] by its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>:

*   **Mission-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>: Aims to achieve specific results and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This type is often top-down, with goals agreed upon at a social or highest level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>: Focuses on doing better what is currently being done, seeking effectiveness and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. It operates with high levels of certainty within existing systems, often driven by factors like austerity, cost reduction, or increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_adaptive_innovation_in_government_services | Adaptive innovation]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>: Responds to new ideas and evolving situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. It cannot be steered top-down and requires creating open space for [[innovation_for_exploration_and_creativity_in_government | creativity]] and experimentation by employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>: Addresses new risks, uncertainties, and future developments, preparing for fundamental shifts and changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This operates in areas of high uncertainty and may involve ideas critical to strategic organizational goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

An [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] portfolio does not need to be equally balanced across these types but should be stewarded meaningfully to align with specific organizational aims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Organizations might be heavily mission-oriented but still need to improve, adapt, and prepare for future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Portfolio Management in the Public Sector

[[Innovation Strategies for Governments | Innovation portfolio management]] is not a new concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Effective [[innovation_strategies_for_governments | portfolio management]] requires:
*   Understanding the types of [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovations]] an organization is working on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   Assigned individuals responsible for stewarding information and making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   Supportive structures for different types of [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] to coexist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Allowing different purposes to merge while connecting synergies between [[types_and_purposes_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   Questioning how [[types_and_purposes_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] types are resourced, monitored, and evaluated across the entire portfolio, not just individual projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. A portfolio's success matters more than individual project failures, as [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovations]] are inherently risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   Managing learning and communication about and within the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## The Portfolio Exploration Tool

The portfolio exploration tool was developed to transform theoretical concepts into a self-service tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Its aim is to enable distributed, self-service exploration without the need for physical presence, which became particularly relevant during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

The tool provides:
*   Guidance on where to develop [[innovation_skills_for_public_sector | innovation capabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   Recommended actions based on results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   Insights into changes over time and where to intervene for shifts in the [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   Individualized guidance to understand organizational capabilities and strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   A [[innovation_strategies_for_governments | portfolio management capability]] score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   Project-based mapping to reveal overall portfolio characteristics based on ongoing projects and activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This helps in "reverse engineering" how support structures can be shifted to achieve a different future portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

The tool provides tailored results and guidance based on individual scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. It also generates anonymized aggregate data, offering a continuously updated global picture of [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] trends, which informs OPSI's future work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

### Levels of Analysis

The tool can be used at various levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>:
*   **Individual**: To understand one's own portfolio or perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   **Team**: To start conversations, make a case for deeper portfolio analysis, see how a team fits into the organizational portfolio, or raise specific [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   **Senior/Central Management**: To get a snapshot, build strategy, and assess alignment between organizational efforts, ambitions, and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

### Practical Application: Natural Resources Wales and City of Lund

Early users like Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and the City of Lund have provided feedback crucial for refining the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

#### Natural Resources Wales (NRW)

NRW is a young public body formed in 2013, with sustainable development enshrined in Welsh legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. They face challenges like the climate emergency and nature crisis, requiring [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] to meet statutory responsibilities without compromising regulation and enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

*   **Initial Approach**: NRW's approach to [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] was informal, but they sought structured frameworks to make sense of their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. The tool helped crystallize discussions and provide a framework for their existing, often unrecognized, [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Balance**: NRW found their organization to be very strong in the enhancement space, which is natural for a public sector organization with specialized staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. However, they need to strengthen their anticipatory space to address radical challenges like climate change and nature collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. The tool highlights the need for capacity in all areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. They also noted that having a balanced portfolio isn't always good, especially when aiming for significant shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>.
*   **Synergies and Discords**: The tool helps identify where [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] is happening and facilitates conversations to find synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. It can also highlight where things are going wrong, such as innovative projects failing to progress due to internal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

#### City of Lund, Sweden

Lund, a university city known for [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]], was part of a Swedish program to push [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] down to the city level, where challenges and emerging solutions meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. With significant research facilities being built, the city anticipates an "explosion" of [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

*   **Challenges**: As a city authority, Lund traditionally focuses on stable service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. Their main challenge is creating awareness of how to use [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation's]] potential and collaborate with external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. The portfolio thinking helps structure thoughts and combine internal efforts with external inflow, avoiding random ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Balance**: Lund found that enhancement and anticipatory areas were not traditionally considered [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovations]] within their organization, meaning they lacked structured goals or resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. Mission-oriented projects, like climate neutrality goals, receive attention but often lack proper implementation support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. The tool's visualization helps discuss different needs and how they fit together, enabling the city to claim areas like risk-taking (anticipatory innovation) and become partners in upscaling solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.
*   **Synergies and Coordination**: The tool facilitates conversations and provides a starting point for discussions and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. It allows organizations to "nail down" their current state, which is crucial for developing strategies and avoiding endless debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>.
*   **[[innovation_strategies_for_governments | Portfolio Management Capability]]**: For Lund, [[innovation_strategies_for_governments | portfolio management]] involves combining systematic approaches (goals, measurements) with people-oriented relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. A neutral facilitator is crucial for negotiating the needs of different innovation areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. It requires patience, persistence, and celebrating successes, focusing on strengths rather than problems to prevent disengagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

## Developing Portfolio Management Capability

[[Innovation strategies for governments | Portfolio management capability]] can exist at different levels (city, ministry, team, or specific mission/goal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>. For cross-cutting issues like climate change, it's essential to consider how different units' portfolios interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. The core of this capability is having someone responsible for collecting, making sense of, and periodically reviewing [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

This responsibility might lie with business management, business development, or natural leaders within a specific mission or issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. It also involves the ability to evaluate portfolio performance, understanding that a 100% success rate suggests a lack of risk-taking and true [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. Demonstrating performance externally is also vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>.

Connecting with external partners (private sector, NGOs) requires analyzing how their portfolios match with the public sector's goals and motivations, identifying areas for synergy and incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. The primary step is allocating time and space for these sense-making activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

### Challenges in Capability Development

*   **Defining Innovation**: A common challenge is agreeing on what constitutes [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] within an organization, leading to questions about what should be included in the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>. OPSI's definition is generally "novel to the context," implemented, and having an impact in terms of shifts in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.
*   **Capacity and Resources**: Even with capable staff, ensuring sufficient time and resources for [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] support and protecting specialisms from being spread too thinly is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>.

The portfolio exploration tool acts as a catalyst for these critical conversations, helping organizations identify where they stand and where they need to shift, especially in rapidly changing environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

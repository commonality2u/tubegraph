Governments engage in [[innovation in government | innovation]] for a variety of reasons, sometimes with precise objectives and at other times simply to foster exploration, both of which can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These different drivers necessitate distinct methods and [[Innovation Strategies in Government | strategies]] for their implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Solving Specific Challenges

One primary reason for [[innovation in government | governmental innovation]] is to address clearly defined [[Challenges faced by governments that require innovation | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. In these situations, governments have a precise understanding of the problems they aim to solve, such as cleaning up oceans or resolving homelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. [[innovation in government | Innovation]] is specifically directed towards reaching these targets, providing a clear structure and legitimization for the activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The problem itself justifies the need for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Fostering Exploration and Creativity

Another important reason is to allow for exploration and creativity for its own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This allows individuals to explore new things, develop new ideas, and apply creativity to solve citizen [[Challenges of government innovation | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Innovation is inherently new and uncertain, and it is impossible to know where the next significant breakthrough will originate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Similar to "entrepreneurial discovery" in the private sector, where transformative ideas often come from those with the freedom to experiment and explore new thinking, the public sector also needs to allow for such exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Public services and products continuously require revamping and transformation to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Developing the Capacity to Innovate

Civil servants and the public sector also innovate to build their inherent ability to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Innovation is not an innate trait; it is learned through the process of exploring new ideas and thinking differently â€“ a "learning by doing" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Governments need to grant a certain "license to explore" and [[Experimentation in government innovation | experiment]] with new ideas, applying them in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This ensures that when major new [[Challenges and opportunities in government innovation | challenges]] arise, the workforce possesses the capacity and experience to develop projects and solve problems in novel ways, having done so before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

This trend is observable in contemporary governments:
*   **Finland** has introduced a new program on [[Experimentation in government innovation | experimentation]] at the central government level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Canada** has an [[Experimentation in government innovation | experimentation]] directive that allows different government departments to test policy ideas before implementing them on a larger scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Staying Relevant and Competitive

Finally, governments also [[Global trends in governmental innovation | innovate]] to avoid being left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Innovating because neighboring countries are doing so is a valid reason, as unexplored options can represent future costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. To remain "in the game" and be prepared when certain options become critical, governments must continuously explore different possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This parallels the private sector, where major companies like Apple or Sony consistently explore new solutions and ideas, not necessarily for immediate application, but because they might become significant in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

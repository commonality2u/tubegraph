Strategic foresight is defined by the OECD as the ability to constantly perceive, make sense of, and act on the future in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Its primary purpose is not to predict the future, but to facilitate better decision-making in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. By using [[strategic_foresight_tools_and_methods | strategic foresight products]] like forecasting and [[foresight_and_scenario_planning | scenarios]], organizations can make better-prepared decisions today, stress-test innovative solutions, and future-proof their current actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Core Benefits for Decision Making

[[Strategic foresight]] provides a structured, participatory, inclusive, and impactful approach to examining future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It typically addresses medium to long-term futures, but can adapt to volatile areas like artificial intelligence or crises such as COVID-19, where the "medium-term" might be a matter of months or weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Its direct contributions to decision-making include:
*   **Priority setting and policy steering** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Identifying challenges and opportunities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Guiding investment in innovative solutions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Stress-testing and future-proofing current decisions and policies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Building shared visions and success stories** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Moving from prediction to anticipation**, exploring future ideas to inform present actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Measuring Impact: Diverse Perspectives

Measuring the impact of [[strategic foresight]] is a complex but crucial aspect of its implementation. Different organizations approach this in varied ways, focusing on how foresight outputs translate into tangible changes in decision-making and policy.

### The Flanders Blueprint: Four Functions for Support

The government of Flanders, in collaboration with the OECD, developed a blueprint to [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_organization_and_governance | integrate strategic foresight into its system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This blueprint outlines four key functions through which foresight provides an "additional level of information" and "support to policymaking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>:

1.  **Discover:** Engaging in trend and weak signal analysis to identify emerging issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This requires dedicated time and skilled personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
2.  **Explore:** Making sense of insights through tools like Horizon Scanning and engaging with the scientific community via science-to-policy dialogues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This creates [[anticipatory_innovation_and_strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | anticipatory intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
3.  **Map:** Connecting insights with current policymaking by exploring scenarios, mapping opportunities and challenges, and using resilient indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Resilient indicators use statistical data to understand future potential and map weaknesses, aiding in crisis preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
4.  **Create:** Focusing on impact and scale by developing visions, roadmaps, and coalitions for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This function emphasizes collaborative work between government and stakeholders to build resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

These functions help explain and facilitate collaboration within the government, extending to other regions and countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### Estonian Parliament: Measuring Policy Influence

The Foresight Center at the Estonian Parliament aims to inform the Parliament and the wider public about alternative scenarios, future risks, and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. They measure impact by observing if parliament members adopt their messages and begin to convey them themselves, serving as a "strong input" to ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>.

Key strategies for influencing policy include:
*   **Proactive media engagement:** Amplifying messages through journalists to increase their perceived seriousness among MPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>.
*   **Integrating numbers and traditional analysis:** Combining foresight methods with quantitative data, hypothetical simulations, or even forecast models to provide concrete figures, especially regarding budgetary impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>. For example, simulating the tax revenue impact of a growing self-employed sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.
*   **Direct engagement:** Involving ministries and interested parliament members in steering committees for specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.

The ultimate measure is when policy designers or key public figures acknowledge and debate an issue identified through foresight, indicating a realization of the challenge and a need for intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:36">[01:21:36]</a>.

### Welsh Government: Legislative Mandate and Systems Integration

Wales' unique approach to futures and foresight stems from the **Well-being of Future Generations Act 2015** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. This legislation mandates the publication of a Future Trends Report and emphasizes "long-term" thinking as one of five essential ways of working for sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.

Impact is demonstrated by:
*   **Curating foresight products for different audiences:** Presenting information in various formats (infographics, summaries, evidence packs) to appeal to different preferences, whether visual, data-driven, or narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>.
*   **Framing foresight as a tool for better decision-making, not just accurate predictions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.
*   **Integrating foresight into existing governmental systems and processes:**
    *   A central part of the impact assessment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.
    *   Included in procurement and grants processes with an appraisal of long-term considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>.
    *   Part of corporate learning and development, providing training to civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>.
    *   Informing region-specific plans that address future trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.
*   **Shifting focus of key government strategies:** Increasingly, strategies for transport, national development, waste, and national milestones incorporate a longer-term (e.g., 2040-2050) perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.
*   **Empowering others:** Providing tools and methods to colleagues to undertake foresight work themselves, rather than acting as a centralized service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.
*   **Harnessing networks:** Developing initiatives like the Wales Futures Hub to pool resources, diversify perspectives, and provide constructive challenge across the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

Measuring the impact of [[strategic foresight]] is not always straightforward due to its qualitative and long-term nature. However, common themes emerge: focusing on how foresight informs, shifts, and future-proofs present decisions. Whether through structured functions, proactive communication, quantitative data integration, or legislative mandates, the goal remains consistent: to enable governments to be more proactive and resilient in the face of uncertainty, ultimately shaping a better future for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. The ongoing efforts and collaborations among foresight practitioners globally demonstrate a vibrant community dedicated to making this impact tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:36">[01:24:36]</a>.

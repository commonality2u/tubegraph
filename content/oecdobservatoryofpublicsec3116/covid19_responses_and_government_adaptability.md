The "Government Aftershock" high-level Forum convenes a global dialogue on modern-day challenges, particularly those revealed by the crisis, and their implications for the future role and expectations of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The forum aims to develop a global call to action for government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A key focus is on annual work surveying global trends and case studies in public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Partnership for Public Sector Innovation

Since 2016, the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation have partnered to identify key trends and case studies in public sector innovation, hoping to inspire replication and action globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## COVID-19's Impact on Government Innovation

The year 2020 was atypical due to COVID-19, which shifted government agendas to focus on combating the global pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This necessitated adjusting and innovating the approach to the innovation trend exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A solid knowledge base was built from 683 cases received from 91 countries through the 2020 Call for Innovation and Research, as well as 450 cases from the COVID-19 Innovative Response Tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Based on this data, five key trends in [[government_innovation_during_COVID19 | government innovation]] over the past year were identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Key Trends and Case Studies

### 1. [[innovative_responses_to_covid19_by_governments | Innovative Responses to the COVID-19 Crisis]]

The first report highlighted that governments rapidly stepped up to take action under exceptional circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Case Study:** Estonia's "Hack the Crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   **Context:** Estonia operates an extremely digital society with most government services online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. It has a long-standing public-private cooperation model, ingrained in its DNA for over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
    *   **"Hack the Crisis" Initiative:** Declared an emergency situation on March 12th, leading to the rapid launch of an online hackathon on March 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. This hackathon engaged 1,000 participants and 30 teams, some of which produced actively used solutions like a government chatbot for citizen questions and physical assets like breathing ventilators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
    *   **Impact:** The Estonian event inspired nearly 70 similar local events worldwide, including the EU-wide "EU vs. Virus Hack" and the "Global Hack," involving around 100,000 people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. It led to thousands of teams finding immediate responses and new business models, and fostered a better dialogue between the public and private sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
    *   **Lessons Learned:**
        *   Government needs capacity to absorb innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
        *   High toll on mental health due to intense work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
        *   Crucial to have "free radicals" within government to adopt innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
        *   Urgency and a strong sense of mission are key for quick innovation with the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
        *   Pre-existing strong connections with hackathon organizers and the tech community are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

### 2. Seamless Government

This concept explores how to eliminate friction points between government machinery and the citizens it serves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Case Study:** UAE Ministry of Possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   **Purpose:** Launched in 2017 as part of Vision 2071 to make the UAE the best nation globally by 2071, this virtual ministry incubates and solves systemic challenges and "impossibilities" hindering government progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. It provides a neutral space, close to the core of government but removed from traditional bureaucratic mandates, measures, and limits to bold thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    *   **Structure:** It has no single active minister, relying instead on time-bound departments focused on "wicked questions" or priority national portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. It applies design thinking and experimentation to develop proactive and disruptive solutions, bringing together federal, local, private sector, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
    *   **Mission Pillars:** Identify impossibilities, incubate virtual time-bound departments to solve them, educate and train individuals on design and experimentation mindset, and inspire other governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
    *   **Challenges:** Initiating projects with unknown solutions or end states, as government employees typically operate in an environment of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Difficulty for team members to adapt to agile, continuous iteration methods based on user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
    *   **Lessons Learned:** Importance of common understanding of the "impossible" for collective progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Need for a dedicated team with specific competencies not involved in other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Patience is key, as resistance to new approaches will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The Ministry aims to be a replicable model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### 3. Focusing on the Overlooked

This trend highlights innovations addressing the needs of societal segments at risk of falling through the cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Case Study:** Barefoot College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   **Mission:** Based in India, it works with the world's poorest and most remote communities, recognizing their potential, founded on Gandhian principles of "Leave No Man Behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Programs operate in 93 countries, addressing 14 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
    *   **Flagship Program:** Innovative, multifaceted, women-led access to clean energy program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. It trains illiterate and semi-literate women to be solar engineers, known as Solar Mamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
    *   **"Enrich" Co-Curriculum:** Developed based on community feedback, it focuses on soft skills such as aspirations, confidence, financial inclusion, digital inclusion, women's health, microenterprise skills, civil society, human rights, and environmental sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Women return to their communities to build, install, and maintain solar systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. A village fund, supported by household contributions (proportion of former kerosene costs), pays the engineers and for replacement parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. Benefits include light, water pumping, better education outcomes, improved health, empowerment of women and girls, environmental sustainability, and livelihood development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.
    *   **Impact of COVID-19:** Pivoted microenterprise training to help communities meet new needs, e.g., producing PPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. Reassessed supply chains and provided funding to ensure communities didn't go hungry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
    *   **Government Partnerships:** Collaborates with governments, private organizations, and NGOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Examples include Zanzibar (solar mamas as part of energy policy), Madagascar (partnering on training centers to electrify homes), and Fiji (building a regional training center to empower women) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.

### 4. Leveraging Powerful New Technologies

This trend discusses the tensions governments face in using new technologies for insight while mitigating harm to freedom and rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Case Study:** Singapore's GovTech (e.g., Facial Verification for National Digital Identity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### 5. Upskilling and Investing in the Public

This report explores how governments are upskilling and investing in people in innovative ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. It identifies two main themes: investing in the public as a critical resource, and upskilling public service to unlock government potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Case Study:** Finland's "Elements of AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   **Goal:** Improve AI literacy among the general public through online education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>. Addresses the "societal cost of the mystification of AI," enabling public participation in discourse and regulation of AI and digital technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.
    *   **Approach:** An online course (elements.helsinki.fi) launched over two years ago, with over half a million participants globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. It's intended for all, requiring no coding or complex math, focusing on AI literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.
    *   **Impact:** Rated highly among AI/computer science courses and received awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. The initiative aims to take the course to people through grassroots activities and local partnerships, expanding across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.
    *   **Diversity:** Remarkable diversity in participants, with 38% female globally and over 50% in Nordic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. Includes users over 80-90 years old, demonstrating broad appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
    *   **Follow-up:** A second course, "Building AI," was launched, aiming to upskill people to innovate new solutions with AI and digital technologies, transforming them from consumers to contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges in Government Innovation

Innovation in government can be perceived as difficult or impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>. However, these case studies demonstrate that impactful innovation is possible. Key insights for success include:
*   **Empowering Teams:** Granting a "safe zone" for incubation and testing with legal permission, especially when backed by leadership like the cabinet, protects employees and allows them to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. The value "protect those who try" is central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **Challenging Assumptions:** Always seek a second opinion when told something isn't possible within government, as laws can be interpreted in various ways to find a breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.
*   **Understanding Government's Role:** Government services often address risks too high for the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>. The public sector should be willing to take these risks and seek opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Demonstrating Value and Impact:** Clearly explaining the value and impact of an initiative helps gain buy-in from all stakeholders – citizens, private sector, and different government entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. Strong leadership buy-in is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>.
*   **Creating Synergies:** Bring stakeholders onboard early in the journey and make them part of the decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>. For instance, in the Ministry of Possibility, a minister acts as a champion, appointing a director and a core team with diverse members (government, citizens, private sector), while a leadership team of ministers and chairmen ensures collective ownership of the "impossible" challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.

## Leveraging Innovation Momentum Post-COVID-19

The disruptive nature of 2020 has underlined the importance of government and its partnerships, acting as a catalyst for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. Years or even decades of advancement have occurred in months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. Going into 2021, the focus should be on:
*   **Stronger Partnerships:** Continuing to build on public-private and NGO/social enterprise partnerships is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Addressing Crisis-Related Needs:** Focusing on areas still impacted by the crisis, such as mental health issues and accessibility to physical and digital services and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Goals:** Balancing urgent crisis responses with long-term commitments like turning the economy greener and addressing climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.
*   **Trust in Science and Adaptability:** Leveraging the increased trust in science and the public's realization that change is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Equality:** Addressing the risk that positive innovations might not be evenly distributed, leading to widening knowledge or skills gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. New innovations are needed to ensure equal benefit for all citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Agile Government Structures:** The pandemic accelerated pre-existing strategies and showed that seemingly "impossible" things could happen rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>. Some governments, like the UAE, proactively responded by announcing more agile and nimble structures, including new ministerial portfolios for government development, digital economy, AI, entrepreneurship, and a chief of strategy and [[government_innovation_during_COVID19 | government innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>. This highlights an opportunity to take bold steps and accelerate previously stalled plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.

### Personal Reflections on Future Work
*   **Do More of What Works:** Continue and expand upon the successful strategies and innovations initiated during the pandemic, even if physical interactions are missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   **Be Bold and Aim Big:** Have the courage to pursue initiatives that are not always what is expected, as they can yield much larger payoffs than strictly adhering to benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>.
*   **Human-Centric Approach:** While technology and innovation are crucial, not everything can be digitized; maintaining a human-centric element in work is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overlooking Risks:** Ensure that "innovation labs" and "mission-based approaches" truly lead to different procedures, not just old practices under new names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Well-being:** Dedicate time for self-reflection and personal well-being to avoid burnout, especially when working on the "edge of government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

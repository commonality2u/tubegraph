Governments must [[innovation_in_government | innovate]] and [[government_innovation_and_adaptation | adapt]] their systems to remain impactful and meet the evolving needs of their citizens and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11"></a>. This need stems from three primary drivers: delivering greater value, responding to a rapidly changing global environment, and proactively preparing for future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17"></a>.

## Delivering Greater Impact and Value

A fundamental reason for [[government_innovation_and_adaptation | government innovation]] is the persistence of unresolved problems faced by citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03"></a>. By [[innovation_in_government | innovating]] and changing their approaches, governments can deliver new or better value to their citizens, thereby increasing their overall impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11"></a>.

## Responding to a Changing World and Evolving Citizen Needs

The world around governments is undergoing continuous transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>. Many existing government systems, such as healthcare, welfare, and taxation, were designed in the 1950s and no longer align with contemporary realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31"></a>.

Key shifts necessitating [[adapting_public_administration_for_digital_transformation | adaptation]] include:
*   **[[digital_transformation_in_government | Digitalization]]**: Citizens increasingly conduct activities and use services online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49"></a>. There is a strong desire for the same ease of experience when interacting with government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54"></a>. This widespread [[digital_transformation_in_government | digitalization]] requires governments to [[adapting_public_administration_for_digital_transformation | adapt]] to new systems, particularly in [[technological_advancements_in_governance | technology]] and [[role_of_technology_in_improving_government_services | digital use]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19"></a>.
*   **Changing Societal Needs**: As societies evolve, so do the needs of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09"></a>. Governments must respond to these new requirements, as people no longer live their lives in the same way they did in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28"></a>.

## Anticipating and Preparing for Future Challenges

Beyond current demands, governments must also look ahead to fundamental changes and complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46"></a>. This involves preparing for the future and anticipating shifts such as climate change, aging populations, and the emergence of new societal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51"></a>. Proactive [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] and different ways of thinking are essential to be prepared for what lies ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06"></a>.

In summary, [[government_innovation_and_adaptation | innovation]] is crucial for governments to increase their impact, [[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | adapt]] to a changing environment, and proactively anticipate future challenges that will fundamentally alter how governments and people function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17"></a>.

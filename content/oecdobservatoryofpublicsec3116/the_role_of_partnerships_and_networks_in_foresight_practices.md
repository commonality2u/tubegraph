Strategic foresight is defined as the ability to constantly perceive, make sense of, and act on the future in the present, aiming to make better decisions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While not intended to predict the future, it helps stress-test current actions and policies to ensure they are future-proofed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Implementing [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] effectively within an organization or government system often necessitates strong partnerships and networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Why Partnerships Matter

Collaboration is crucial for effective [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] because it inherently involves crossing boundaries:
*   **Time boundaries** Not just looking at the present, but also considering the past and long-term future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Policy domains** Challenges are often interconnected and do not fit neatly into single policy areas, requiring cross-domain understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Solutions must also be interrelated across different policy domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Actor boundaries** Governments cannot achieve their goals or serve society in silos; they need to work with diverse actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

Working with others helps identify challenges and opportunities, build shared visions, and achieve the anticipatory intelligence needed to address societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. It supports a structured, participatory, inclusive, impactful, and systemic approach to future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Key Principles of Collaboration
For [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] work, several principles guide collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>:
*   **Future-proofing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>
*   **Evidence-based** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>
*   **Inclusivity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>
*   **Systemic understanding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>
*   **Resilience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>

Effective collaboration also requires clear expectation management, a balanced internal and external capacity, and moving from fragmented projects to a more structural mandate for [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

## Types of Partnerships and Networks

Various actors contribute to a robust [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] ecosystem:
*   **Academic institutions** Engaging with the science community through "science-to-policy dialogues" can be highly effective for gathering intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This includes working with universities and research funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **International organizations** Collaborations with bodies like the OECD help in assessing existing systems and building governance for [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Other governments and regions** Working with other countries and regions allows for shared learning, identifying common challenges, and collaborating on solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
*   **Private sector and innovative initiatives** Collaborating with companies offering [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] platforms or tools can enhance capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Citizens and stakeholders** National dialogues can embed citizen participation into [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>. Inclusive and appropriate participation of multiple actors and stakeholders is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Media** Proactively using media to amplify [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] messages can be an instrumental hook to engage policymakers and the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### Flanders and OECD Collaboration
The OECD and the Government of Flanders collaborated for over two years to assess Flanders' [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] system and create a blueprint for its integration into the government system from a multi-level perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This partnership also involved building an "anticipatory good practice principles" governance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Flanders Strategic Foresight for Resilience Initiative
During the COVID-19 crisis, the Flemish government initiated a "Strategic Foresight for Resilience" initiative to generate anticipatory intelligence for [[evidenceinformed_polic policymaking_using_strategic_foresight | evidence-informed policymaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This involved partnerships with academia, EU institutions (like the GRC), and promising European initiatives like Futures Platform and TomorrowLabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

The initiative defined four functions for [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]]:
1.  **Discover:** Trend and weak signal analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
2.  **Explore:** Sense-making through horizon scanning, system analysis, and science-to-policy dialogues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
3.  **Map:** Connecting intelligence to current policymaking using [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | explorative scenarios]], Futures Wheels, and resilient indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
4.  **Create:** Generating impact and scale through visions, roadmaps, and coalitions for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

An example of the "Explore" function was a 2022 collaboration with the FWO Flanders research fund and the V in the Netherlands, bringing scientists and policymakers together to understand challenges and opportunities across five themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. For the "Map" function, Flanders worked with ten other European regions to explore [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | scenarios]] for a resilient Europe, using a digital platform for horizon scanning and organizing scenario workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

### Finland's Proactive Government
Finland has a comprehensive ecosystem of [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] assets, including a parliamentary Committee for the Future, a [[public_sector_and_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]] team in the Prime Minister's office, and a dedicated fund (Sitra) that produces megatrend reports and facilitates national dialogues for citizen participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. While strong in assets, an OECD assessment noted an "impact gap" in integrating these activities into core government processes like budgeting and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. The focus is on integrating [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] into everyday policy cycles through dialogue between specialists, policymakers, civil servants, and decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

### Estonia's Parliamentary Foresight Centre
The Estonian Parliament's Foresight Centre informs the public and Parliament about alternative [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | scenarios]], risks, and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. They involve parliament members and ministries directly through steering committees for each topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. To maximize impact, they proactively engage with media and combine [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] methods with traditional analysis to provide quantitative data, especially highlighting budgetary impacts to engage policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

### Wales Futures Commission
Wales has a unique approach to [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] stemming from the Well-being of Future Generations Act (2015) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. This legislation mandates a future trends report and emphasizes long-term thinking as a key way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | Foresight]] is integrated into existing systems, including impact assessments, procurement processes, corporate learning, and regional planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.
A key recommendation from recent research was the importance of harnessing networks to maximize influence and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>. As a result, a Wales Futures Hub is being developed across the Welsh public service in collaboration with the Future Generations Commissioner's office and Nesta, aiming to pool resources, diversify perspectives, and provide constructive challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. This demonstrates the value of leveraging networks beyond academia, including other countries and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

### Nesta: Strategic Foresight for Transformative Innovation
Nesta, the UK's [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | Innovation Agency]], uses [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] to inform [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | transformative innovation]] in areas like education, health, and sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. Their Discovery team conducts horizon scanning, stress tests ideas, develops novel methodologies (blending [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] with data science and qualitative research), and engages staff with new ideas through guest speakers and expert residencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>. They also create dedicated time for exploration through sabbaticals and "Explorations Week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.

## Introduction: Shifting from Reactive to Proactive Governance

Governments worldwide are facing an increasingly complex and uncertain environment, characterized by issues such as climate change, migration, and rapidly developing technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. These complex systems and their inherent problems have become the norm rather than the exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. While governments have shown capability in reacting quickly and efficiently to crises like the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, a purely reactive approach to [[evidenceinformed_policymaking_using_strategic_foresight | policy making]] is proving increasingly inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The imperative is to move towards proactive governance, where issues are anticipated and responded to innovatively before they fully emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This requires not only the ability to adapt to unforeseen [[challenges_and_solutions_in_foresight_implementation | challenges]] but also to [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | anticipate]] different futures and prepare for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The concept of [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation governance]] aims to bridge innovation and [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]] to help policymakers learn from both approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Core Concepts: Strategic Foresight and Experimentation

The [[public_sector_and_strategic_foresight | public sector]] needs to innovate not just to improve present administration, but increasingly for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | Anticipation]] and innovation are crucial to ensure that [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | futures]] and [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | foresight]] knowledge is not confined to silos but actively used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The most important aspect of [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | anticipation]] is that it leads to action today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, enabling governments to take steps towards preferable futures or to avoid undesirable [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | scenarios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation distinguishes between innovation (doing new things) and experimentation (the process of rigorously measuring if new things work) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. This means trying out new approaches and measuring their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.

## Why Strategic Foresight and Experimentation are Essential

The need for [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_policy_making | strategic foresight]] and experimentation stems from several critical factors:
*   **Responding to Emerging Challenges** Governments face acute pressure to respond to emerging [[challenges_and_solutions_in_foresight_implementation | challenges]] like climate change, migration, and the complexities of the digital environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Inadequacy of Reactive Approaches** A reactive approach to [[evidenceinformed_policymaking_using_strategic_foresight | policymaking]] is increasingly insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Anticipating and Preparing** Governments need the ability to [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | anticipate]] different futures and prepare for them, rather than waiting for crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Strengthening Trust and Democracy** Proactive governance contributes significantly to strengthening citizens' trust in government, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It addresses [[challenges_and_solutions_in_foresight_implementation | challenges]] like democratic change, economic and social consequences of global events, and the digital environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Uncertainty** Governments often face situations where they lack complete evidence, especially with rapidly evolving technologies. [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | Anticipation]] allows for proactive measures instead of less beneficial "end-of-pipe" solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Country-Specific Implementations and Approaches

Several countries are actively engaged in building [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation governance]] systems:

### Finland
Finland is at an early stage but optimistic about building a new governance model that stimulates [[evidenceinformed_policymaking_using_strategic_foresight | policy making]] for future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Key building blocks include:
*   **Changes in Strategic Planning** Moving to a strategic government program system, first implemented in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

*   **Current Gaps** A lack of inbuilt connection between intensive [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | foresight]] work and actual political decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Next Steps** Raising awareness, broadening engagement with political decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>, and conducting case studies in specific policy areas to test elements of the new model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.

### Ireland
Ireland is systematically introducing [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_policy_making | strategic foresight]] into its [[evidenceinformed_policymaking_using_strategic_foresight | policymaking]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   **Motivation** The experiences of the financial crisis, COVID-19, and the looming climate crisis highlighted the need for proactive policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **Fit for Purpose Public Service** The goal is to make the public service fit for purpose by 2030 and beyond, by anticipating mega-trends like climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth, and migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Approach** Working with senior policymakers and experts across government departments to understand existing practices and explore [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.
*   **Funding and Governance** Funding from the European Commission's Technical Support Institute to develop a [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight action plan]] and capacity building within existing public service reform structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.
*   **Integration with Policy Development** Ensuring [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_policy_making | strategic foresight]] insights are linked and acted upon through the wider [[evidenceinformed_policymaking_using_strategic_foresight | policy making]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **Next Steps** Developing capacity building programs, including [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]] literacy training at senior levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>, and developing case studies to showcase benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

### Canada
Canada has been pushing for increased experimentation at the federal government level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.
*   **Definition of Experimentation** Doing new things and rigorously measuring if they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>. This involves trying to measure if something is working and if it is better than previous methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>.
*   **Key Activities** Building capacity for experimentation through training programs and calls for projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>, supporting an experimentation community of practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:23">[00:48:23]</a>, and working on systems change through directives and annual surveys on departmental experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.

### Sweden
The Swedish government's Comet Committee focuses on advancing technology, innovation, and ethics with an overarching ambition to increase the speed towards sustainability goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.
*   **Three-Part Model** The Comet Committee uses a model based on:
    1.  **Understanding:** Continuously understanding new developments and creating safe mechanisms for this, including technology briefs and financing regulatory interactive activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
    2.  **Testing:** Encouraging Sweden to be a testing ground for new work ways, technologies, solutions, and regulations, using concepts like "regulatory greenhouses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>. This involves multi-actor collaboration on real-world tests to speed up processes (e.g., electric grid expansion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
    3.  **Changing:** Adopting a more agile and step-wise approach to regulation and policy change, such as developing understanding before setting standards or legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.
*   **Culture Journey** This is seen as a long-term cultural journey, not a revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>, requiring leadership, governance, steering, and courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

### Basque Country
The Basque Social Innovation Lab is connecting [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory governance]] frameworks to a specific mission: accelerating a transition towards a more sustainable economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Distinction from Traditional Foresight** Moving beyond exclusive expert analysis to combine traditional [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | foresight]] with a portfolio approach that incorporates strong social and cultural initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.
*   **Iterative Process** This involves deep listening to social and cultural dynamics, combining it with expert analysis and data to build sense-making capabilities at different levels of action (public sector, community, start-up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.
*   **Generating Infrastructure for Innovative Responses** The aim is to create social, political, public, and private infrastructure that can generate more innovative responses to emerging problems, rather than just predicting specific topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.

### Norway
Norway is developing seamless government services, particularly focusing on how to link [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | anticipation]] to missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>.
*   **Seamless Services Project** Aims to make public services seamless and integrated for users, regardless of the providing agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. This involves both systemic innovation and digital transformation for seven prioritized "life events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.
*   **Foresight and Anticipatory Innovation Methodology** Directly follows a government whitepaper that presents [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | foresight]] as a methodology and skill to be used more by the [[public_sector_and_strategic_foresight | public sector]] to promote innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>.
*   **Tools and Methods** Offering updated "driving force" documents and running workshops to test and learn with the live events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:44">[01:18:44]</a>.
*   **Tying Anticipation to Missions** By establishing an understanding of a sector (e.g., voluntary) and simultaneously exploring the future through [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | future scenarios]], a long view helps establish more short-term missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>. This helps understand future user needs and prioritize development areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:33">[01:20:33]</a>.
*   **Cross-Silo Work** Scenario planning helps create a common platform for different sector representatives to discuss the future, influencing strategic blind spots and promoting future-oriented solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:32">[01:22:32]</a>.

## [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | Challenges]] and Barriers to Implementation

Despite the clear benefits, several [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | challenges]] hinder the effective [[challenges_and_solutions_in_foresight_implementation | implementation]] of [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_policy_making | strategic foresight]] and experimentation:
*   **Reactive Mode vs. Proactive Stance** A tendency to look at future issues as a separate exercise, putting them aside and waiting for something to happen that demands reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Siloed Foresight** The lack of an inbuilt connection between intensive [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | foresight]] work and actual political decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Political Buy-in** Difficulty in motivating and bringing political decision-makers into discussions about long-term [[challenges_and_solutions_in_foresight_implementation | challenges]] and wide social consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   **Access to Expertise** Governments often lack the methodological and process expertise to run rigorous experiments or navigate bureaucratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Data Availability and Quality** The ability to measure and know if improvements are occurring is often limited by insufficient or poorly organized data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>.
*   **Openness to Failure and Risk Aversion** There is a cultural fear of failing, even though good experiments inherently involve the possibility of not succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. Governments often tend to ignore uncertainty and simplify complex issues, creating a false sense of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>.
*   **Timelines** Experimental results are most useful in advance, but policy demands often require immediate action, making it difficult to integrate longer-term experimental timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
*   **Resistance to New Things** Government operations often favor precedent, making it challenging to introduce new approaches like experimentation and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.
*   **Obsolete Legislation** Rapid technological development can render new legislation obsolete within a very short time, indicating a disconnect between policy and the pace of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>.
*   **Institutional Comfort Zone** A reluctance within institutions to take risks and move out of their comfort zone to embrace necessary paradigm shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:52">[02:16:52]</a>.

## Key Levers for Jumpstarting Anticipatory Innovation

Experience from various initiatives suggests several key levers to kickstart and sustain [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation governance]]:
*   **Empowering People** Granting permission to empower individuals dealing directly with problems, enabling them to use the future to envision their own outcomes and define their own [[challenges_and_solutions_in_foresight_implementation | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:01">[02:21:01]</a>.
*   **Collaboration, Co-creation, and Co-design** These multi-disciplinary approaches are crucial for developing policies and solutions, involving stakeholders from the framing of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:59">[02:21:59]</a>.
*   **Humility** Acknowledging that one does not have all the answers and being willing to seek them together, even when leaders are expected to have solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:13">[02:22:13]</a>.
*   **Creating Spaces for Experimentation** Designating dedicated "innovation spaces" where new ways of working, cooperating, steering, and anchoring processes can be tried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:53">[01:24:53]</a>.
*   **Building Momentum and Capacity** Starting small or establishing governance structures, but always focusing on building momentum and capacity for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

## Addressing Paradigm Shifts and Future-Proofing

The discussion on [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] often extends beyond incremental change to address fundamental paradigm shifts. While such shifts are harder to [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | anticipate]] and motivate budgeting for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:32">[02:05:32]</a>, a core aspect of [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation governance]] is to reconcile with complexity and recognize that transformation is often unknowable until it happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a>.

It is important to find individuals who naturally think beyond conventional boundaries and provide them the space to express disruptive ideas, even if they seem "ridiculous but ultimately true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>. This includes looking to creative fields like science fiction for insights into distant futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:26">[02:09:26]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is not to predict the future with certainty but to build an infrastructure—social, political, public, and private—that can generate more innovative responses to emerging problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>. This involves embracing a position of ethical action in the present, which creates a "gift to tomorrow," rather than clinging to notions of organizational immortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:16">[02:15:16]</a>. However, this must be balanced with the responsibility of governance to manage transitions carefully, considering the welfare of potentially millions of people affected by profound changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The pursuit of [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation governance]] is a crucial and long-term journey for governments in a rapidly changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. By systematically integrating [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_policy_making | strategic foresight]] and experimentation, fostering [[the_role_of_partnerships_and_networks_in_foresight_practices | partnerships]] and networks, and cultivating a culture of humility and adaptability, governments can move beyond reactive postures to proactively shape a better future for their citizens and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:47">[02:26:47]</a>.

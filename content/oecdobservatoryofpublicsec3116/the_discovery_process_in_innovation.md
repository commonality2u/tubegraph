The discovery process in innovation is primarily characterized by [[understanding_adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]], focusing on exploration rather than clear, predetermined goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It involves discovering new ideas and what is possible, which is crucial for the emergence of novel concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Core Characteristics
Traditionally, innovation often occurs within existing systems and paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, the discovery process, through adaptive innovation, involves:
*   **On-the-ground exploration** This means discovering new ideas that could prove useful for existing services or even challenge established systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **[[bottom_up_approach_to_innovation | Bottom-up engagement]]** It requires giving people, especially those closest to the end-users, the space and permission to explore new ideas from a [[bottom_up_approach_to_innovation | bottom-up perspective]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Responsiveness to signals** Innovators draw upon signals and feedback from citizens' lives to innovate, test, and experiment accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Outcomes of Discovery
The discovery process can lead to various types of innovation:
*   **Transformative innovations** These are significant shifts that emerge from exploring new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovations** These focus on improving existing services or systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Both types of outcomes are vital and emerge from this exploratory approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Example: Canada's Regulatory Apps
An example of adaptive innovation demonstrating the discovery process comes from Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Government employees, working at their desks, developed apps to make the regulatory system more accessible and understandable for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

This initiative shifted the [[problem_framing_in_innovation | problem framing]] from simplifying regulation to making it understandable and usable for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The focus moved from "making regulation simple" to "making it understandable and usable" for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This change in approach was a direct result of the adaptive, discovery-led innovation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The adoption of a more mission-oriented approach is crucial for effective [[challenges and solutions in public policy implementation | implementation tools]] and fostering new methods of collaboration [00:00:56]. This approach emphasizes alignment on long-term challenges, overcoming silos, and enabling bottom-up experimentation alongside strategic thinking [00:01:05].

## Key Elements for Effective Implementation

Successful implementation of health policies, particularly through a mission-oriented approach, requires several critical components:

*   **Stakeholder Involvement and Inclusive Language** Discussions in groups highlighted the need for involving stakeholders, including using more common and inclusive language to translate policy terms, thereby allowing for greater bottom-up involvement [00:01:20].
*   **Feedback Loops and Accountability** Establishing feedback loops and sustained mechanisms for accountability is essential throughout the course of a mission [00:01:41].
*   **Adapting Governance Structures** Dealing with uncertainty and adapting existing governance structures are important aspects of implementation [00:01:50].
*   **Multi-sectoral Collaboration** The biggest opportunities lie in areas where multi-sectoral knowledge, experience, and decision-making power converge [00:08:41]. A shared mission facilitates collaboration and co-ownership of actions, requiring all collaborators to take responsibility in their areas of expertise [00:08:56].
*   **Addressing Fragmentation** A primary goal of the mission approach is to circumvent fragmentation in research, healthcare, and education [00:10:21]. It seeks to improve outcomes for at-risk individuals and patients by focusing research on patient needs [00:10:44].
*   **Infrastructure Background** A strong infrastructure background is necessary, particularly as healthcare moves towards personalized medicine [00:39:41]. This involves integrated centers with research, education, and healthcare components, such as comprehensive cancer centers and their surrounding networks, to ensure equitable access for all patients and address inequalities [00:11:14].
*   **Implementation Research** Prevention, which receives limited funding (about 7% of typical cancer research budgets), has the potential to reduce cancer problems by 40% [00:11:35]. Therefore, implementation research in this area is of great importance [00:11:53].
*   **Patient Involvement** Patients should be involved in clinical trials and in the development of comprehensive cancer centers [00:13:50]. However, there are still gaps, such as clearly defining outcomes research, health economics, and the representation of implementation [00:14:15]. While patient involvement is widely discussed, the practicalities of doing so—such as reaching representative groups, providing equal opportunities, and allocating necessary resources—are challenging [00:36:31]. Organizations need to move beyond good intentions and develop methodologies for meaningful patient engagement [00:37:08].
*   **Respect for Administrative Systems** It's important to respect and understand administrative systems and leadership within healthcare, as activities are often tied to routines and annual budget cycles. These administrative aspects need to be developed hand-in-hand with collaborative efforts [00:38:35].

## Challenges and Solutions in Implementation

Achieving effective health policy implementation involves overcoming several challenges:

*   **Stakeholder Alignment** Aligning stakeholders with varying interests requires engagement, collaboration, trust, a common vision, and a broad mix of expertise at different levels, from office work to advisory boards [00:17:09]. Crucially, it involves collaboration with patients and their relatives at all steps, and clear, consistent communication [00:17:48].
*   **Penta Helix Model** The collaboration model for precision medicine involves a "penta helix" of stakeholders: academia, healthcare, patients, authorities, and industry [00:18:33]. While stakeholders are committed to working together, a change in collaborative practices is needed as these partners are not always used to working with each other [00:19:09].
*   **Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)** Large-scale PPPs, such as the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), demonstrate the potential for catalyzing state-of-the-art oncology research and development by bringing together diverse partners (academia, industry, SMEs, philanthropy) [00:22:15]. These partnerships require:
    *   Full agreement and buy-in on objectives [00:23:37].
    *   A clear legal and intellectual property (IP) framework [00:23:47].
    *   A detailed work plan where every participant knows their role [00:24:45].
    *   Professional alliance management to oversee complex projects [00:24:55].
    *   Overcoming initial distrust between industry partners [00:45:00] and between academia and industry [00:45:50]. This requires hard work, joint development of vision, and a willingness to overcome personal egos [00:46:27].
*   **Unusual Partners** Sometimes, effective solutions require engaging unusual partners, such as ministries of economy or transport, to address gaps like patient access due to lack of transportation [00:25:50]. This broader partnership extends to education and schools for prevention and health literacy initiatives [00:27:13].
*   **Funding and Sustainability** Innovation funding is traditionally project-based and solution-oriented [00:30:37]. Funders need to collaborate more closely to ensure long-term funding perspectives [00:30:41]. This requires more work on health economics to understand the societal benefits of [[missionoriented_innovation_in_healthcare | mission-oriented innovation in healthcare]] and to develop holistic and sustainable reimbursement models [00:30:49].
*   **Data Management and Awareness** Data quality, standards, access, protection, and cybersecurity are extremely important, serving as a support tool rather than a limit [00:33:13]. Patient input, such as patient-reported experiences and outcomes, and platforms for online monitoring and information exchange are crucial [00:33:41]. Integrating genetic information into routine healthcare also presents a challenge, requiring awareness-raising and engagement of patients [00:34:38].
*   **Prioritization of Follow-Up** When diagnostic tools identify risks (e.g., genetic testing for cancer), it's crucial to have a clear plan for follow-up services, who pays for them, and how to handle individuals with those risks [00:35:09]. This prioritization of subsequent steps needs to be agreed upon before launching such activities [00:35:36].
*   **Transparency and Knowledge Sharing** Transparency within a mission ensures that all parties are aware of each other's activities, preventing repetition and enabling effective resource utilization [00:42:36]. Lessons learned from one mission, such as the IMI project or cooperation between primary and tertiary care, should be shared more broadly within healthcare [00:43:07].

## Future Opportunities

The COVID-19 pandemic has tested healthcare systems globally but also created a unique opportunity to redefine cancer care and establish a "new normal" for healthcare [00:54:18]. There is a collective willingness among stakeholders to move in the same direction, with strong examples of collaboration between patient organizations and industry [00:51:24]. Initiatives like the comprehensive cancer centers in Germany demonstrate the power of working together on a larger scale [00:52:01].

This recent experience shows that with urgency and a willingness to act, significant progress can be made rapidly [00:48:38]. The importance of professional management in handling multiple stakeholders is key, as single experts alone cannot solve complex issues [00:49:03]. This requires strong leadership, effective communication, and transparency [00:49:56].

The collaborative nature of [[missionoriented_innovation_in_healthcare | Mission-oriented innovation in healthcare]], exemplified by initiatives like Vision Zero Cancer, provides a framework for active leadership and builds trusted sharing mechanisms [00:53:42]. This joint learning process ensures that all types of stakeholders across the system are on board, leading to exciting developments in health policy implementation [00:54:01].

[[Mission-oriented innovation in public policy | Mission-oriented innovation policy]] requires a coordinated package of policy and regulatory measures tailored to mobilize science, technology, and innovation to address societal challenges. These measures span various stages of the innovation cycle, utilize diverse policy instruments, and cross different policy fields, sectors, and disciplines, all targeting ambitious, measurable goals within a defined timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

A primary challenge lies in [[challenges_in_implementing_missionoriented_projects | operationalizing these ambitions]] and making missions work in practice, particularly concerning long-term governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This often involves navigating complex stakeholder landscapes.

## Defining Missions: The Consensus Challenge

A key aspect of strategic orientation for missions is creating a broad consensus on selected societal challenges and translating them into clear, bold objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This involves securing and balancing the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, including politicians, experts, and policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. A risk of involving too many actors is the potential for mission inflation or dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Effective engagement strategies are needed to go beyond "usual suspects" and include citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Policy Coordination Across Silos

The main challenge in policy coordination is uniting public and private actors across disciplinary, sectoral, and policy silos to work towards commonly agreed missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This requires engaging policy bodies beyond the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) area, extending to sectoral ministries and regulatory bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Coordinating these diverse actors across different levels of governance can be complex, as illustrated by the governance structure of mission-driven top sectors in the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Implementation Challenges in Practice

[[challenges_in_implementing_missiondriven_approaches | Effective implementation]] necessitates tackling several stakeholder-related challenges:

*   **Connecting Instruments** Practical implementation involves connecting supply-side and demand-side instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Incentive Differences** Scaling up bottom-up initiatives reveals different cultures and ways of working between agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. Incentives differ among actors, requiring adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.
*   **Formal and Legal Issues** Small-scale pilots can bypass formal and cultural issues, but scaling up introduces legal debates, such as publicizing applicant lists between different agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.
*   **"Prestige" and Scaling** When ministries and politicians become involved, initiatives gain more "prestige," which can complicate and formalize processes that were flexible at a smaller scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.
*   **Building Movements** There's often an underestimation of the need to create a "movement" and necessary awareness and buy-in among local stakeholders to drive missions forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of [[cocreation_and_stakeholder_engagement_in_mission_setting | cocreation and stakeholder engagement]] from the outset.
*   **Cross-Departmental Coordination** Bringing different government departments and ministries together around a shared mission remains a core challenge, especially in creating integrated roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>.
*   **Incentivizing Industry** For funding agencies, a challenge is to incentivize greater involvement from companies, as government funding alone is often insufficient for large mission problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>.
*   **Integrating Demand-Side Policies** Combining science policy with demand-side policies like consumer behavior and regulation is difficult to ensure technological ideas translate into real-world solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>.

## Specific Contexts and Nuances

*   **Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs):** In LMICs, challenges include ensuring the mission is sufficiently localized and owned by national actors (government, civil society), rather than being externally driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. The existing coordination mechanisms of international development and humanitarian systems, alongside national government systems, must be assessed for their fitness for purpose in advancing cross-sectoral work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>. A major issue is the "projectification" of work, which makes securing long-term commitment challenging due to changing development priorities of international actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.
*   **Australia (CSIRO):** CSIRO's model, without a central government funding pool for missions, necessitates "crowding in" existing financial and other resources from industry, government, research, and civil society stakeholders to scale missions and achieve impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   **Norway (RCN):** The Research Council of Norway has successfully used bottom-up, inter-agency work for "accelerated missions," where entrepreneurial spirit helps bypass formal and cultural issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>. However, scaling these up to a "whole-of-government approach" faces challenges due to strong sectoral government structures with different objectives and autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>.
*   **Vietnam (UNDP):** The UNDP in Vietnam focuses on deeply understanding the challenge space and underlying drivers to design effective interventions, using methods like a "studio approach" to bring together people from diverse backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>. A key learning is that a circular economy transition requires changing fundamental economic logics and engaging ministries beyond just environment, necessitating cross-ministerial efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>. The need to create a "movement" at the local level for effective implementation was also observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.
*   **Denmark (Innovation Fund Denmark):** In Denmark, a challenge for the Innovation Fund is to encourage stakeholder-defined roadmaps to clearly articulate impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. There is also "battling" among research stakeholders due to significant funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. A critical implementation challenge is maintaining focus and adherence to the roadmap while retaining agility to adapt to changing circumstances and incentivize new companies and researchers to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. There is a need for robust methods, both legally and culturally, to stop underperforming projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges

The OECD's Mission Action Lab aims to support policymakers and stakeholders in facing these challenges and finding practical solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This includes facilitating [[cocreation_and_stakeholder_engagement_in_mission_setting | co-creation of objectives]] and targets, setting up specific governance structures, and designing and implementing intentional policy mixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. [[integrating_missionoriented_approaches_in_government_and_policymaking | Integrating mission-oriented approaches in government and policymaking]] is a gradual process that involves experimentation and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

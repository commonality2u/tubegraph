[[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]] focuses on testing and trying new approaches to respond to a changing operating environment driven by new knowledge, technologies, or crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:04">[10:22:04]</a>. It is a crucial component of a comprehensive public sector innovation portfolio, especially given the unprecedented pace of change faced by governments and institutions globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:07">[10:37:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:41">[10:41:41]</a>.

## Defining [[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive Innovation]]

[[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]] starts with the question of how an evolved situation changes operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:06">[24:10:06]</a>. Organizations strong in this area concentrate on exploring ideas, playing with, testing, and trying new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:04">[24:21:04]</a>. The innovation itself can be part of the discovery process rather than a predefined goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:04">[24:33:04]</a>.

Key points from research-based perspectives include:
*   **Adapting to change** It focuses on adapting to internal and external change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:14:04">[25:14:04]</a>.
*   **Learning and Iteration** Takes learning and iteration (continuous improvement) as core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:05">[25:16:05]</a>.
*   **Complex Ecosystem** Recognizes the complex ecosystem in which adaptation takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:01">[25:21:01]</a>.
*   **Collaboration and Experimentation** Emphasizes collaboration and bottom-up experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33:04">[25:33:04]</a>.
*   **Versatile Applications** Has been used as the capacity to be adapted to change, a proactive innovation approach, and a governance framework applicable to different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:42:02">[25:42:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:01">[26:00:01]</a>.
*   **Relationship with other Innovation Types** Rarely stands alone, potentially leading to transformative change or enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:01">[26:20:01]</a>.
*   **External Benefits** Effects and benefits are often external or shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:01">[26:52:01]</a>.
*   **Conflicting Priorities** May involve conflicting priorities between providing adaptability and maintaining sufficient stability for citizens and societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>.

Drivers for [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]] appear at three levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18:01">[27:18:01]</a>:
*   **Environmental** Factors outside organizational boundaries, such as policies or threats (e.g., COVID-19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:01">[27:29:01]</a>.
*   **Organizational** Structural and cultural characteristics, including resources, organizational culture of continuous improvement, and teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:01">[27:51:01]</a>.
*   **Individual** Employee willingness and openness to apply new methods and practices, and ability to make fast decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:01">[28:11:01]</a>.

[[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]] is part of a broader "innovation facets" model, which helps orient and contextualize the purpose of innovation as part of a whole portfolio approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. The four areas of innovation include:
*   **[[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]]** Trying out and testing new things to adapt to changing demands and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation** Making improvements and efficiencies in existing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented innovation** Achieving big societal goals, typically directed top-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>.
*   **[[anticipatory_innovation_in_the_public_sector | Anticipatory Innovation in the Public Sector]]** Exploring unknown future spaces and engaging with them before explicit needs arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>.

## Supporting and Challenging [[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive Innovation]]

### Supporting Strategies
*   Providing organizational "slack" (spare time or capacity) for public servants to explore alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:01">[28:57:01]</a>.
*   Empowering staff with autonomy to try new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>.
*   Creating incentives for frontline staff to generate innovative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:00">[29:17:00]</a>.
*   Clarifying reasons to innovate without being prescriptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a>.
*   Clarifying acceptable levels of risk or experimentation magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>.
*   Fostering formal and informal learning to keep staff updated on changes and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.

### Known Challenges
*   **Over-investment Risk** Potential for over-investment in one type of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:00">[29:56:00]</a>.
*   **Fragmentation** Risk of fragmentation or lack of coherence if initiatives operate independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03:00">[30:03:00]</a>.
*   **Integration Difficulty** Difficulty incorporating successes and lessons into broader organizational and policy practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:00">[30:28:00]</a>.
*   **Contextual Contingency** Successful adaptive innovations can be highly contingent on specific contextual factors, making scaling difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>.
*   **Challenging Status Quo** Internal organizational tension can arise from challenging the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Direction** Can be responsive but lack clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>.
*   **Redundancy** Inefficiencies from too much redundancy (e.g., multiple entities creating the same solution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:59:00">[31:59:00]</a>.
*   **Perception of Waste** Slack resources required for this work may be seen as wasteful and easily cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:10:00">[32:10:00]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Outcomes** Outcomes can be ridiculed, disdained, or ignored if unexpected or contrary to prevailing culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:24:00">[32:24:00]</a>.

It is important that [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]] is part of a diverse [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation in the public sector]] portfolio, supported by various projects, structures, and a policy environment that allows for all types of innovation simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:53:00">[32:53:00]</a>.

## Case Studies in [[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive Innovation]]

### Japan: Agile Governance and Governance Innovation
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has pursued "Society 5.0," a human-centric society where cyber-physical systems promote economic growth and solve societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:00">[38:04:00]</a>. The core challenge is how to ensure people enjoy liberty and a sustainable society in a rapidly changing, complex, and uncertain environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:42:00">[38:42:00]</a>. Building trust is key for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:47:00">[39:47:00]</a>.

Traditional governance models (vertical, rigid rules) are insufficient for Society 5.0 due to rapid changes in technology, society, and even governance goals (e.g., evolving meaning of privacy or safety) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:18:00">[40:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:28:00">[41:28:00]</a>. METI proposes "Agile Governance," a new model that continuously and rapidly designs rules and evaluates outcomes with multi-stakeholders horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:18:00">[43:18:00]</a>.

The six steps of Agile Governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:36:00">[43:36:00]</a>:
1.  **Analysis** Continuously analyze changing conditions and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Define Goals** Align goals with societal and technological changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:43:00">[43:43:00]</a>.
3.  **Design Systems** Design governance systems, including technological, organizational, and applicable rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:48:00">[43:48:00]</a>.
4.  **Implementation** Continuously monitor system operation based on real-time data and disclose information for accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:01:00">[44:01:00]</a>.
5.  **Evaluation** Evaluate whether goals are accomplished and update systems if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:23:00">[44:23:00]</a>.
6.  **Re-analysis and Redefinition** Continuously re-analyze external conditions and redefine goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:37:00">[44:37:00]</a>.

This concept applies to various governance mechanisms (corporate, regulation, infrastructure, markets) and includes "governance of governance" to comprehensively design the overall framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:09:00">[45:09:00]</a>. Solutions involve incentivizing businesses for agile governance (e.g., disclosure guidelines, sanction redesign) and redesigning regulations to be goal-based, flexible, and leverage regulatory sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:03:00">[46:03:00]</a>.

### Portugal: LabX and Citizen Participation
Portugal's Administrative Modernization Agency (AMA) works on the LabX team, contributing to the [[innovation_in_public_services | innovation of the public services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. LabX serves as a safe space to research, co-create, and experiment with innovative solutions to improve public services, centering them around the real needs and expectations of citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:04:00">[51:04:00]</a>.

Examples of LabX's work:
*   **Citizen Shops** Improved services by understanding user feelings through on-site surveys, observations, co-creation workshops with civil servants and citizens, and prototyping new solutions in "living labs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:34:00">[51:34:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Authority Interaction** Conducted ethnographic work, interviews, and digital surveys to improve communication and make the tax authority more approachable to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:14:00">[54:14:00]</a>.
*   **Education for Citizenship** Developed a card game to engage children in understanding citizenship concepts, finding that kids preferred playing outside over cell phones and that the game itself became a tool for civic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:00:00">[56:00:00]</a>. This project led to over 450 kits distributed to 300+ schools, fostering local engagement projects (e.g., cleaning neighborhoods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:26:00">[59:26:00]</a>.
*   **Engaging Civil Servants** Developed methodologies (e.g., Lego Serious Play workshops, card sorting) to listen to frontline civil servants, recognizing their valuable insights into improving services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.
*   **Youth and Digital Services (Project 18)** Identified that young people make little use of public online services despite being digital natives, and struggle with citizen participation and public infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. The project aims to redesign the digital experience by using plain language, providing support for navigation (e.g., chatbots learning youth language), and creating a single point of contact for relevant services, aiming for completion by September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.

Portugal's "Simplex" program has been a flagship for innovation and modernization for 15 years and was a privileged tool for adaptive response to the pandemic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. It released about 200 measures in response to the pandemic, based on broad interaction with citizens, companies, civil society, and public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

### USA: 10x Program
The US 10x program, within the General Services Administration (GSA), addresses the high failure rate of government technology projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>. It adopts a venture capital mindset to improve the public's experience with the US government by investing incrementally in ideas sourced from government employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>.

Key differentiators of 10x:
*   **Idea Sourcing** Utilizes a bottom-up [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]] approach, leveraging the expertise of government employees as "hands-on practitioners" who deal with problems daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.
*   **Funding Model** Influenced by venture capital, it uses modular, smaller funding tranches, requiring pitches for additional funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. The goal is to spend the smallest amount necessary at each stage, embracing the philosophy of "fail fast, fail forward, fail small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>.
*   **Risk Mitigation** Implements rigorous milestones and checkpoints for projects to hit before advancing to the next funding tranche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.
*   **Embracing Unknown Outcomes** Assumes that project outcomes are not fully known at the outset, focusing on understanding the problem and figuring out the solution path incrementally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>.

The 10x phased approach includes:
1.  **Investigation** Understand the problem space, identify red flags, duplication of efforts, and build-or-buy decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>.
2.  **Discovery** Understand the solution space, market fit, finances, timelines, and produce a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.
3.  **Development** Build a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and ensure at least one active customer is using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>.
4.  **Scale** Proliferate the tool to increase users and deliver maximum impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>.

Projects can be closed or successfully graduated at any phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. 10x funds projects that benefit multiple agencies or impact a large segment of the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>.

Examples of 10x projects:
*   **US Web Design System** A collection of reusable digital components for government websites, empowering individual agencies to improve their online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>.
*   **De-risking Technology Field Guide** Addresses challenges in government technology projects by offering guidance on acquiring custom software, asking questions about user needs, vendor monitoring, and modern software development practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:57">[01:23:57]</a>.
*   **Eligibility APIs Initiative** Aims to rethink how government programs are administered by embedding eligibility criteria in code, allowing computer determination of eligibility and making processes faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>.

10x is expanding its focus beyond just technology to include investment themes like public trust and civic life, public lands and environment, and equity in delivery, all sourced from federal employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:55">[01:27:55]</a>.

## Reflections on Sustainability and Impact

A critical question for [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]] is how to ensure sustainable and institutionalized changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>.
*   **Multi-Stakeholder Engagement** Success depends on involving all stakeholders simultaneously (government, companies, citizens) and proving the value of new approaches and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:56">[01:31:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:25">[01:33:25]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Political Cycles** Frequent leadership changes can impede institutional memory and require constant effort to break silos and maintain innovation momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:18">[02:20:18]</a>.
*   **Beyond Technology** [[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]] extends beyond technology to include changes in administrative cultures, processes, and back-end systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:46]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs** A key challenge is managing trade-offs between efficiency and democratic values, transparency, accountability, public value creation, and safeguarding common good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:43">[01:54:43]</a>. Unlike the private sector which prioritizes profitability, the public sector must serve all citizens, balance diverse needs, and consider long-term impacts like environment, education, and pension systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact** Evaluating [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]] is challenging due to the lack of a baseline for new, emerging solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>. Traditional evaluation measures of economy, efficiency, and effectiveness need to be supplemented with "efficacy" – the ability to take action when directions change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. New evaluation methods like outcome harvesting or contribution analysis are needed to match the nature of adaptive innovation and focus on shared outcomes with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The "cost of not doing" something is a crucial metric, as demonstrated by examples like the hidden costs of citizen frustration with difficult-to-use digital services, or the broader economic and health benefits of accessible mobility aids for the elderly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:10">[02:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:37">[02:16:37]</a>. This highlights the need to factor in externalities when assessing the value of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation in the public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:52">[02:17:52]</a>. Investing in both [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]] and appropriate evaluation processes is essential to demonstrate its overall efficiency and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

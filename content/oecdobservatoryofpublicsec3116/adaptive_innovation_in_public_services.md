Adaptive innovation is a crucial component of a comprehensive public sector innovation portfolio, especially in a rapidly changing world where institutions face unprecedented paces of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. This approach involves testing new methods to respond to evolving operating environments driven by new knowledge, technology, business models, or crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:26]</a>. It is about trying out and testing new things to adapt to the pace of change and changing expectations and demands on governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:57]</a>.

## Defining Adaptive Innovation
Adaptive innovation focuses on adapting to internal and external change, with learning and continuous iteration as core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:14:00">[25:14:18]</a>. It recognizes the complex ecosystem in which adaptation occurs and emphasizes collaboration and bottom-up experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:36]</a>. The innovation itself may be part of a discovery process rather than a predefined goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:00">[24:33:35]</a>.

Adaptive innovation has been observed in three ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:42:00">[25:42:45]</a>:
1.  **Capacity to Adapt** The ability to adapt to change, particularly in the face of extreme events like crises, to build resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:45:00">[25:45:54]</a>.
2.  **Proactive Innovation** A proactive approach to respond to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:59]</a>.
3.  **Governance Framework** A governance framework applicable to various contexts and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:06]</a>.

Adaptive innovation rarely stands alone, often leading to transformative change or enhancement-oriented innovation, and can be a byproduct of various activities aimed at increasing adaptive capacity or a result of goal-oriented actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:48]</a>. The effects and benefits of adaptive innovation are frequently external or shared, and there can be conflicting priorities between providing adaptability and ensuring sufficient stability for citizens and societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:52:00">[26:52:07]</a>.

## Drivers of Adaptive Innovation
Research indicates that drivers of adaptive innovation exist at three levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:25]</a>:
*   **Environmental** Appear outside organizational boundaries, such as policies promoting new approaches or external threats (e.g., COVID-19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:00">[27:32:44]</a>.
*   **Organizational** Refer to structural and cultural characteristics, including resource availability (e.g., funds) and an organizational culture of continuous improvement, iteration, learning, and teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:11]</a>.
*   **Individual** Relate to employee willingness and openness to apply new methods and practices, and their ability to make fast decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:29]</a>.

## Supporting Adaptive Innovation
Supporting adaptive innovation involves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:53:00">[28:53:00]</a>:
*   **Providing Slack** Offering organizational slack, spare time, or capacity for public servants to explore alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:59:00">[28:59:05]</a>.
*   **Empowering Autonomy** Empowering staff with autonomy to try new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:08]</a>.
*   **Feedback Mechanisms** Considering how feedback can be given, especially where frontline staff might not typically generate [[innovative public service design | innovative ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:22]</a>.
*   **Clear Reasons** Clarifying reasons to innovate without being prescriptive on the "how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:31]</a>.
*   **Risk Clarity** Clarifying acceptable levels of risk or experimentation magnitude without explicit authorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:38]</a>.
*   **Fostering Learning** Promoting formal and informal learning to keep staff updated on changes, opportunities, and public expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:53]</a>.

## Challenges and Pitfalls
Known challenges in establishing adaptive innovation capacity include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>:
*   **Over-investment Risk** Potential over-investment in this type of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:58:00">[29:58:03]</a>.
*   **Fragmentation** Risk of fragmentation or lack of coherence if projects bloom independently, especially for big goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03:00">[30:03:24]</a>.
*   **Integration Difficulty** Difficulty incorporating successes and lessons back into broader organizational and policy practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:00">[30:28:36]</a>.
*   **Contextual Contingency** Lessons from successful adaptive innovations can be highly contingent on specific contextual factors, making scaling difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:15]</a>.
*   **Status Quo Challenge** Internal organizational tension arises from challenging the status quo, especially if adaptive efforts demand complete rethinking of service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:38]</a>.
*   **Lack of Direction** Responsive but lacking direction; something working does not mean it "should" be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:52]</a>.
*   **Redundancy Inefficiencies** Inefficiencies from too much redundancy if multiple entities create the same solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:06]</a>.
*   **Perceived Wastefulness** Slack resources needed for this work may be seen as wasteful and easily cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:10:00">[32:10:18]</a>.
*   **Outcome Ridicule** Outcomes can be ridiculed, disdained, or ignored if unexpected or contrary to the prevailing culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:24:00">[32:24:39]</a>.

## Adaptive Innovation as Part of a Portfolio
Adaptive innovation should be part of a diverse innovation portfolio, encompassing not only projects but also support structures and a policy environment that simultaneously supports various innovation purposes. This requires a robust portfolio management function to oversee all activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:53:00">[32:53:19]</a>.

The OECD's "Innovation Facets" model helps contextualize the purposes of innovation as part of a whole portfolio approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:29]</a>. The four areas are:
*   **Adaptive Innovation** (as defined above) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:45]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation** Focused on improvements and efficiencies in existing services and ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:14]</a>.
*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation** Aims at achieving large societal goals (e.g., Sustainable Development Goals), typically top-down and outcome-specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:30]</a>.
*   [[anticipatory_innovation_in_public_sector | Anticipatory Innovation]] Explores unknown and ambiguous future spaces to identify ways to engage in the present before explicit needs emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:48]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### Portugal: Modernizing Public Services
Patricia Peralta, from the Portuguese Administrative Modernization Agency's LabX team, highlights their contribution to [[innovation in public service delivery | innovation of public services]] in Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:37]</a>. The Portuguese Ministry of the Modernization of the State and Public Administration is committed to [[innovation in public service delivery | public sector innovation]] and partnerships to achieve a more resilient public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:14]</a>.

[[innovative public service design | Innovation]] in the public sector goes beyond simplification or technology, encompassing a culture of permanent productivity, cross-sectoral collaboration, and sharing of knowledge, best practices, and diverse perspectives to develop a broad [[innovation in public service delivery | innovation ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:25]</a>. The goal is a more digital, agile, and inclusive public administration, aligned with UN SDGs and the OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:42]</a>.

Adaptive innovation activities are vital as they are often bottom-up driven, requiring the empowerment of various players to explore different angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:58]</a>. Innovation is a human capability that involves both commitment and a roadmap, linking innovation with participation methods and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:22]</a>. Public innovation systems naturally embed civic participation and open administration principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:32]</a>.

Portugal is working to ensure public administration adopts a human rights-based approach in designing, delivering, and evaluating public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:03]</a>.
*   **LabX** (Laboratory for Experimentation in Public Administration) brings civic participation to the forefront of public administration work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:17]</a>.
*   **Simplex** is Portugal's flagship [[Innovation in public service delivery | innovation]] and modernization program for the past 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:27]</a>. It proved to be a critical tool for adaptive response during the 2020 pandemic crisis, with over 200 measures released in weeks, based on broad interaction with citizens, companies, civil society, and public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
The pandemic brought significant changes, increasing digital service delivery, accelerating collaborative processes, boosting productivity, and mass adoption of remote work, leading to new, innovative solutions and a transformative movement in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:31]</a>.

LabX operates as a safe space for research, co-creation, and experimentation of [[innovative public service design | innovative solutions]] to improve public services, centering them around the real needs and expectations of citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:16]</a>.
*   **Citizen Shops Project**: LabX conducted fieldwork (800+ surveys, observations) and co-creation workshops with civil servants and citizens to improve the "Citizen Shop" model, a "one-stop shop" for various public services. They prototyped and tested solutions in "living labs" where people experimented with new solutions and provided feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:17]</a>.
*   **Tax Authority Project**: LabX investigated how to improve communication and interaction between citizens and the tax authority through ethnographic work, in-depth interviews, and digital surveys (1000+ participants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Education for Citizenship**: When asked to develop an app for children to understand citizenship, LabX questioned the "why an app" assumption. They developed a card game to interview children, which itself became a tool for citizenship development. This project demonstrated that [[Innovation in public service delivery | innovation]] isn't always technology-driven; sometimes a simple piece of paper can solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:23]</a>. The game was distributed to over 300 schools, leading to about 30 local engagement projects involving families in community activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Listening to Civil Servants**: LabX developed methodologies (e.g., adapted Helsinki's participation game, Lego Serious Play workshops, card sorting) to gather insights from frontline civil servants, recognizing their invaluable understanding of citizen realities and how to deliver better services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.
*   **"On at 18" Project**: This project aimed to understand the best way to provide public services to young people and redesign their digital experience with public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>. Findings revealed young people make little use of public online services despite being digital natives, struggle with citizen participation, and need plain language, more knowledge about benefits/responsibilities, support, and a single point of contact for relevant services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. This led to recommendations for designing digital services for youth and the ongoing development of a single contact point on the e-Portugal platform, including a chatbot adapted to youth language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

### Japan: Agile Governance
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) undertook the "Governance Innovation" project to design a new governance framework for a digitalized "Society 5.0" (human-centric society promoted by cyber-physical systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:59]</a>. The core challenge is building trust in a complex, uncertain, and rapidly changing society where traditional governance tools are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:18]</a>.

The traditional "vertical" governance model, where government provides rigid rules, no longer works in a rapidly changing society where goals themselves continuously change with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
The proposed **Agile Governance** model involves continuously and rapidly designing rules and evaluating outcomes with multi-stakeholders in a horizontal way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. It has six main steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>:
1.  **Analysis** Continuously analyze unchanging conditions and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:43]</a>.
2.  **Define Goals** Define goals in accordance with changes in societies and technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:45]</a>.
3.  **Design Systems** Design governance systems (technological, organizational, rules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:59]</a>.
4.  **Implementation & Monitoring** Continuously monitor system operation based on real-time data and properly disclose information on goals, systems, risks, and results to stakeholders (accountability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:19]</a>.
5.  **Evaluation** Evaluate whether defined goals have been accomplished through existing systems, updating if not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:19]</a>.
6.  **Re-analysis & Redefinition (External Cycle)** Continuously analyze whether external conditions or risk landscapes have changed, requiring revisions to goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

This agile governance concept applies to various mechanisms like corporate governance, regulation, infrastructure, markets, and societal norms. Above these, "governance of governance" is needed to comprehensively design and continuously review the overall mechanisms by multi-stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

Recommendations for implementing agile governance include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>:
*   **Incentivizing Businesses** Public authorities should provide disclosure and compliance guidelines to help businesses adopt agile governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. Corporate sanction mechanisms should be redesigned based on the company's governance and cooperation in detecting misconduct, rather than mere outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Redesigning Regulation** Regulations should be goal-based rather than rule-based, allowing businesses more [[Innovation in public service delivery | innovative ways]] to pursue regulatory goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. Non-binding, flexible standards designed by multi-stakeholders can assist businesses. Regulatory bodies should also learn through implementation, making use of regulatory sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### United States: 10x Program (GSA)
The 10x program, part of the Technology Transformation Services unit within the General Services Administration (GSA), aims to solve the problem of many government technology projects failing to deliver value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>. This often occurs because contracts are not set up for success, agencies are unfamiliar with modern software realities, or projects don't focus on user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

10x rethinks this by adopting a venture capital mindset adapted to a government context, with the goal of improving the public's experience with the US government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>.
Key differences in their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>:
*   **Sourcing Projects Differently** An adaptive innovation approach that leverages the expertise of government employees. They cast a wide net across the government tech ecosystem, empowering any federal employee to submit an idea, problem, or pain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.
*   **Funding Differently** Influenced by the venture capital model, 10x uses a modular approach with smaller initial funding, requiring pitches for additional funds later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. They spend the smallest amount necessary at each stage to determine project viability. Instead of grants or loans, they hire in-house technologists to build for government by government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>.
*   **Mitigating Risk Differently** Modeled after VC best practices, they institute rigor, establishing milestones and checkpoints for each project team before moving to the next funding tranche. This incremental investment allows for due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.
*   **Embracing Unknown Outcomes** Embraces agile best practices for an [[Innovation in public service delivery | innovation]] approach. They don't assume the project's endpoint in Phase 1, starting with the problem and figuring out the solution as they progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>. They give teams a brief pitch and let them find their path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.

10x invests in ideas where multiple agencies would benefit, or that impact a large segment of the public interacting with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>.

The 10x process involves a phased approach with dollar ceilings and milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>. A core philosophy is not fearing failure, but failing fast, failing forward, and failing small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:37]</a>. Projects can be closed or successfully graduate at any phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:06]</a>.
*   **Phase 1: Investigation** Understand the problem space ("Is this a bad idea?") to identify major red flags, duplication of efforts, or if buying a solution is better than building in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>.
*   **Phase 2: Discover** Understand the solution space ("Is this a good idea?"). Questions focus on current state, market fit, finances, timelines, and scalability, aiming for a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.
*   **Phase 3: Development** Build out the solution ("Will anyone use this thing?"). Teams must reach a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and have at least one active customer using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.
*   **Phase 4: Scale** (If necessary) Proliferate the tool ("Will everyone use this?"), increasing user volume for maximum impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>.

**Examples of 10x projects**:
*   **US Web Design System**: A series of reusable digital components for individual webmasters across the US government (or globally) to improve their websites, offering choice rather than prescriptive rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>.
*   **De-risking Technology Field Guide**: Addresses why technology projects in government often fail. It provides guidance for a wide audience (not just tech people) on acquiring custom software, focusing on user needs, vendor monitoring, product ownership, and modern software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:57">[01:23:57]</a>.
*   **Eligibility APIs Initiative**: A rethinking of how government programs are administered. It explores coding eligibility criteria into computer programs from the policy-making stage, allowing faster, automated determination of eligibility for benefits, reducing manual processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>.
*   **Investment Themes**: 10x expands beyond pure technology, asking federal employees what problems they want to solve in categories like public trust and civic life, public lands and environment, and equity in delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:14">[01:28:14]</a>.

## Sustaining Adaptive Innovation

Sustaining adaptive innovation is the hardest part of the process, as it involves overcoming the challenge of adoption and influencing broader cultural and financial norms within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:35">[01:34:35]</a>. If an agile, lean process moves quickly from idea to solution, the end stakeholders or users might not be ready to adopt it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. Governments often don't function at this speed in their resourcing and financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:28">[01:35:28]</a>. Meeting stakeholders "somewhere in the middle" is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:39">[01:35:42]</a>.

Confidence in creating sustainable change depends on involving all stakeholders simultaneously and proving the value of the solution or process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:22">[01:33:58]</a>. This means showing results to frontline civil servants and top management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:50]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis, despite its human toll, triggered an unprecedented avalanche of adaptive innovation in the public sector, highlighting the critical need for speed and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:09]</a>. This experience should be analyzed and learned from to acknowledge that innovation and adaptation should be a general yardstick, not just a crisis response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:09]</a>.

A major challenge for public sector [[government innovation and adaptation | innovation and adaptation]] is the frequent change in political leadership, which can lead to a loss of institutional memory and the need to constantly convince new leaders of the value of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:28]</a>. However, the tradition of civil servants maintaining lifetime careers helps retain historical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:45">[02:20:55]</a>. Financial incentives from entities like the European Commission can help de-risk the transition to a more adaptive public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">[02:22:09]</a>. It is crucial to remember that adaptive innovation is not solely about technology; it requires changing administrative cultures and rethinking processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:46">[02:22:56]</a>.

### Cost of Non-Innovation

The concept of "cost of not doing something" or "cost of non-innovation" is important for demonstrating value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:14]</a>. This involves quantifying the economic and trust implications of not implementing improvements (e.g., wasted time, frustration, health costs, lost economic activity, reduced confidence in government) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

Traditional public administration evaluation often focuses on economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. For adaptive innovation, a fourth "E," **efficacy** (the ability to take action when things are changing direction), is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Evaluation methods must match the type of innovation, especially when dealing with new, uncertain, and complex situations without a baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Methods like outcome harvesting, mapping, contribution analysis, and process analysis, which develop alongside the project, can capture shared outcomes with citizens and other participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

Ultimately, investing in both adaptive innovation and appropriate evaluation processes is crucial to demonstrate that this approach is more economical, efficient, and effective for the public sector, in addition to boosting efficacy for civil servants and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) was established to assist governments in identifying emerging trends, understanding their implications, integrating new approaches into standard practices, and providing trusted advice on fostering a deliberate, consistent, and reliable approach to [[Innovation in public administration | public sector innovation]] [00:00:45]. A key area of focus for OPSI, aligning with its mission to "uncover what's next," is the concept of "Rules as Code" [00:01:04], explored in their primer, "Cracking the Code: Rulemaking for Humans and Machines" [00:01:19]. This primer, part of OPSI's working papers on public governance, provides insights into emerging issues, concepts, and trends in public sector management [00:03:01].

## What is Rules as Code?

Rules as Code is an innovative concept that rethinks one of the core functions of government: rulemaking [00:03:31]. It involves creating an official version of rules in a machine-consumable format, enabling computer systems to understand and act upon them consistently [00:03:42]. This goes beyond traditional natural language communication to humans [00:03:46]. While coded rules already exist, often created by businesses, individuals, and governments based on natural language versions [00:21:49], the primer emphasizes Rules as Code as a strategic, deliberate, and systemic approach [00:22:20]. In this approach, machine-consumable rules are conceived and created from the outset of their formation [00:22:28].

The adoption of Rules as Code at scale could significantly alter how governments create, disseminate, and enforce regulations [00:04:27]. It is expected to enhance compliance [00:04:34], enable superior policy modeling [00:04:45], and simplify public understanding of rights and obligations [00:04:50]. The urgency of this concept is amplified by current global challenges, such as the COVID-19 crisis, which has accelerated trends like [[Digital transformation in public administration | digital transformation]] [00:04:59].

## Benefits and Opportunities

### Enhanced Transparency and Fairness
A key benefit of Rules as Code is its potential to improve transparency and fairness in rule application. Current processes often suffer from a "translation gap" between written legislation and its practical implementation, leading to inconsistencies and unfair outcomes [00:29:27]. By codifying rules, it becomes possible to capture and trace decisions back to the precise legal basis and data points used [01:01:13]. This allows for better auditing of decisions and appeals, ensuring that governments and public sectors are more accountable [01:03:38].

### Improved Policy Modeling and Iteration
Rules as Code facilitates more effective policy modeling and allows for rapid, iterative, and test-driven policy development [00:32:04]. Instead of relying solely on academic modeling or abstract notions, policies can be prototyped and tested in reality before wide implementation [00:39:13]. This multidisciplinary approach, involving policy experts, legislators, service designers, technologists, and end-users, helps ensure that new policies are fit for purpose and that policy intent is realized through implementation [00:33:06]. Examples like France's Open Fisca, initially a simulation software for the Treasury [00:10:30], evolved into tools for citizens to understand their rights and obligations [00:11:36] and for parliamentarians to analyze the impact of proposed budget changes via tools like Lex Impact [00:48:46].

### Adapting to a Machine-Readable World
In an increasingly digital world, machines are becoming significant users of rules [00:34:40]. Unlike humans, machines do not respond to legal, financial, or criminal pressures [00:35:03]. Therefore, designing rules with machine consumption in mind from the outset is crucial for effective monitoring, security, and intervention paradigms in the 21st century [00:35:08]. The rise of [[Artificial intelligence in public administration | AI]] further underscores the need for clear, codified rules; without them, AI systems will interpret rules based on their own internal logic, potentially prioritizing outcomes like monetary value over human well-being if not explicitly coded otherwise [00:40:28]. This shift is about creating an "augmented public sector" where humans and machines collaborate to respond to the exponential speed and complexity of modern challenges [01:04:09].

### Bridging the Policy-Service Chasm
Currently, a significant "chasm" exists between policy formulation and its implementation, hindering the rapid response and effectiveness needed in dynamic environments [01:05:32]. Rules as Code, by providing authoritative coded versions of rules, helps close this gap. Policy makers can gain real-time insight into whether their intent is being met, and implementation teams can better understand original policy goals [01:05:47]. This integration is vital for building resilient, effective, and responsive governments capable of thriving in a rapidly changing world [01:07:06].

## Challenges and Considerations

Implementing Rules as Code, like any [[Digital transformation in public administration | digital transformation]] initiative, presents challenges, primarily requiring the legitimacy of building interdisciplinary teams [00:15:53]. It necessitates legislative drafters, coders, economists, and policy officers working together, often breaking traditional silos within government [00:16:07].

Furthermore, it is crucial to understand the limitations of Rules as Code. It is not about automating every decision or eliminating human discretion, particularly in areas like criminal justice [01:08:03]. The goal is not a "technocratic fantasy" [00:45:51] but rather improving the quality of public service delivery by automating repetitive tasks and freeing civil servants to focus on more complex, discretionary cases [00:46:02]. This involves distinguishing between prescriptive rules suitable for coding and areas that require human judgment and interpretation [00:45:07].

The process does not need to be top-down or overly complex at the start. Starting with specific use cases that address an existing need or problem, and then iterating on small prototypes, is a more effective approach [00:58:40]. Itâ€™s about "finding a carrot" or a "shiny toy" to incentivize collaboration among different actors [00:58:31].

Another critical aspect is harnessing the intelligence of civil society and external experts. Governments should foster alliances with external developers, researchers, and citizens who can contribute to rule coding, scrutinize policies, and identify areas for improvement [00:52:50]. This requires a fundamental shift in governmental organization, including embracing open source practices and changing traditional chains of command to allow for greater public participation in the rulemaking process [01:12:50].

## Conclusion

The journey towards Rules as Code is a continuous learning process, not a pre-planned grand design [00:10:03]. It's a "mind shift" and an "organizational shift" [01:12:40] that goes beyond technology, deeply integrating with the culture and practices of public administration [01:13:58]. By making rules more understandable and actionable for both humans and machines, Rules as Code is a vital part of the democratic process, ensuring that citizens can comprehend and interact with the rules that govern their lives [01:11:04]. This ongoing transformation is essential for governments to be fit for purpose in the 21st century [01:18:21].

[[missionoriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is a concept and approach that seeks to redefine the role of public policy in driving societal change and economic growth. It focuses on tackling complex societal challenges through a coordinated package of policy measures that are ambitious, outcomes-oriented, and involve broad collaboration across sectors and disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.

## Core Concepts

The approach advocates for a "market-shaping" or "market co-creating" role for the public sector, rather than merely a "market-fixing" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This involves actively creating and directing markets towards specific societal goals, rather than just intervening when markets fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

A key aspect is understanding growth not just by its rate, but by its direction, aiming for growth that is more inclusive, sustainable, and innovation-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This links directly to global objectives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## Key Principles and Characteristics

[[definition_of_mission_oriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is characterized by:
*   **Outcomes-Oriented and Problem-Picking:** Policies are designed to address grand societal challenges (e.g., climate change, inequality, health crises) rather than starting with predetermined solutions or technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">[00:57:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.
*   **Bold and Ambitious Goals:** Missions should be inspirational, fostering new thinking and clear directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.
*   **Cross-Disciplinary and Cross-Sectoral:** They require collaboration across different policy fields, disciplines (including humanities and social sciences), and sectors (public, private, and third sector) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.
*   **Driving Multiple Bottom-Up Solutions:** While setting clear directions, missions must also enable diverse bottom-up experimentation and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   **Risk-Sharing and Reward-Sharing:** Public policy is not just about "de-risking" the private sector, but actively sharing risks and, importantly, sharing the rewards that arise from publicly financed innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Horizon and Adaptability:** Missions often involve a long and sequential process, requiring flexibility and continuous engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>.

## Challenges in Implementation

Implementing [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] in the [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | public sector]] faces several challenges:
*   **Siloed Structures:** Government departments and agencies often operate in silos, making cross-departmental collaboration difficult due to existing incentive structures and HR processes that discourage breaking silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.
*   **Traditional Metrics and Evaluation:** Current evaluation methods (e.g., cost-benefit analysis) may not capture the dynamic spillovers and broader [[impact_of_mission_oriented_innovation_on_society | impact of mission-oriented innovation on society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion:** Public agencies are traditionally seen as stabilizing forces rather than risk-takers, and decision-makers fear negative evaluations for failures, hindering necessary experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.
*   **Narrative and Mindset Shift:** A fundamental change in the storytelling about public policy is required, moving away from the idea that public action is merely about fixing market failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.
*   **Defining Missions:** Challenges include ensuring missions are genuinely broad and impactful, avoiding "mission washing," and allowing for an iterative process of definition rather than a one-off event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.
*   **Scalability and Diffusion:** Many [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] policies remain pilots; scaling up successful local solutions and ensuring their diffusion is a significant hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy and Administrative Instruments:** Existing procurement processes, budget allocations, and administrative rules can break up the mission logic and prevent timely, coordinated action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>.

## Strategies for Implementation

To operationalize [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] and overcome challenges:
*   **Placement of Missions:** Missions should be at the center of economic growth strategies, not just siloed within innovation policy, engaging finance ministries alongside innovation ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.
*   **Co-Creation and Participation:** Engage diverse stakeholders, including citizens, from the outset to co-create missions and solutions, ensuring bottom-up input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:37">[01:42:37]</a>.
*   **Place-Based Approach:** Focus on specific system environments (like a street or a school) to foster systemic change, enabling direct work with people in context and immediately addressing complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.
*   **Platform Strategy:** Align the entire system around prototypes and mission areas, fostering collaboration and coordination across different initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:44">[01:22:44]</a>.
*   **Building Capability and Learning Organizations:** Public sector organizations need internal capabilities to take risks, learn from failures, and continuously adapt, moving away from an outsourcing mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Metrics and Evaluation:** Develop new metrics that capture dynamic spillovers and societal impact, moving beyond traditional cost-benefit analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.
*   **Strategic Use of Public Finance and Procurement:** Leverage public banks, procurement agencies, and recovery funds to steer the direction of growth, setting conditionalities that encourage innovation and public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Focus on Relationships:** Recognize that building effective collaboration and breaking silos is fundamentally about fostering trusted personal relationships and mutual understanding among diverse actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:44">[02:04:44]</a>.

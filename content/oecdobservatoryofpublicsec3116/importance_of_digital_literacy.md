Digital literacy is crucial for both citizens and public servants in the digital age, influencing the effectiveness and inclusivity of public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the expectation for governments to be "digital by default," mirroring personal and working interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, this approach requires careful consideration to ensure services meet the expectations of all users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Challenges without Digital Literacy

A significant portion of the population may not be comfortable using or may lack the ability to use digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This includes:
*   People who don't have a computer or are simply uncomfortable with digital platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   Citizens who lack a [[digital_advancements_and_accessibility_challenges_in_public_innovation | digital identity]] to access advanced administrative services remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   A significant percentage of the population in countries like Portugal who have never used the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

It is important to remember that not everyone wants to use the online channel to interact with public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, and this choice should be respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

## Importance for Citizens

Ensuring high levels of [[digital_media_literacy_tips | digital literacy]] among citizens is vital to avoid leaving anyone behind in the digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. Efforts to improve citizen digital skills include:
*   Establishing physical "French Houses" or "citizen spaces" where people can receive assistance and improve their [[digital_media_literacy_tips | digital skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>. These spaces often provide trained mediators to help citizens use digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   Deploying mobile "citizen spaces" using vans to reach remote areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   Implementing programs like France's "Digital Pass," which offers free coupons for classes to increase digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   Training "digital advisors" or "teachers" to provide on-the-ground support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>.
*   Introducing computer science subjects in primary and secondary schools as a long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>.
*   Creating accessible communication that is easy to understand, even for individuals with disabilities or those who struggle with technical language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

## Importance for Public Servants

Digital literacy within the public sector is essential for governments to react quickly to challenges and effectively design and deliver services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Key aspects include:
*   **Skills and Capabilities**: Public servants need skills and understanding of agile ways of working to build services in-house and procure the right technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Systematic Improvement**: Ongoing, systematic improvement of knowledge and skills for service providers is necessary to foster a modern business culture, improve cooperation, and maintain a user focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
*   **User Research Integration**: Designers, developers, and data scientists within government teams should engage in user research to understand how different groups (e.g., farmers, people with disabilities, those less comfortable with digital) interact with services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.
*   **Observational Learning**: Government staff can gain valuable insights by observing citizens using digital services in mediation centers, which highlights the need for simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>.

## Balancing Digital and Non-Digital Approaches

While advancing [[role_of_digital_tools_in_government | digital opportunities]], it's crucial to adopt an [[inclusive_digital_participation_and_accessibility | omnichannel approach]] that supports multiple channels, including traditional physical services, telephone lines, and face-to-face interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This ensures that even those who can't or don't want to use digital channels can still access services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The goal is to provide a consistent quality of service across all channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.

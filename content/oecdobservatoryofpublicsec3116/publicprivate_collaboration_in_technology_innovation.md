In an increasingly complex world, addressing societal problems requires going beyond traditional governmental silos, especially when it comes to technology policy and its interaction with other governance institutions [00:00:38]. This necessitates a more integrated and anticipatory process throughout government [00:01:09]. Beyond internal government structures, there's a growing recognition of the crucial role of external [[publicprivate_partnerships_in_innovation | public-private partnerships]] and broader societal engagement in shaping technology policy and innovation.

## The Role of the Private Sector in Innovation

In many OECD countries, the private sector plays a dominant role in research and development, conducting approximately 70% of all R&D [01:00:08]. This highlights a potential gap if [[public_sector_innovation_and_collaboration | public sector innovation]] and anticipatory governance efforts are solely focused on government entities and public research [01:00:00]. It raises the question of whether current approaches are "missing the mark" by not adequately engaging the private sector as a key site for anticipatory governance in technology [01:00:11].

The private sector is inherently in the business of anticipating the future to remain competitive, often imagining and shaping what's coming down the road [01:33:54]. However, the challenge lies in effectively integrating these private sector insights and activities into broader societal goals.

## Integrating Private Sector and Public Engagement

To foster more comprehensive technology innovation, strategies for [[collaborative_approaches_in_public_sector_innovation | public-private collaboration]] and public engagement are essential:

### Multi-Stakeholder Initiatives and Engagement
For complex issues like energy transitions, which are both technical and political, a "multi-stakeholder initiative" is necessary [00:32:35]. This approach requires involving society in the process [00:32:48]. Effective collaboration means ensuring all stakeholders are involved from the beginning, sharing a common understanding of the problem and a collective path forward [00:35:00].

### Defining Challenges and Setting Parameters
Government can play a powerful role by clearly defining challenges and broad themes for innovation [01:37:10]. This can be seen in initiatives like hackathons for public policy purposes or national innovation challenges, which provide specific bounds and parameters within which private sector creativity can flourish [01:37:14]. This initial bounding helps focus efforts on problems with public policy significance [01:38:00].

### Upstream Governance and Value Alignment
There is a need to encourage companies, particularly startups, to adopt a mindset that considers the social dimensions of scalability from the outset, integrating these into their business models and technology designs [01:38:54]. This means moving beyond profit-driven motives to embrace "public value" propositions [01:40:42]. Initiatives focusing on social entrepreneurship, B corporations, and value-driven corporations are examples of this trend, extending to the concept of "public interest technology" [01:35:27].

Mechanisms like "radical transdisciplinarity" can help: by articulating value-driven goals through participatory processes, including input from humanities and social scientists, engineers can then optimize technology design for those societal values [01:35:57].

## Challenges in Collaboration

*   **Engaging Startups:** It can be difficult to involve small companies and startups in these discussions, as their primary focus is often on survival and rapid development [01:35:04]. There is a current lack of systematic instruments to guide tech startups in considering anticipation and social change as core to their innovation processes [01:39:47].
*   **Balancing Scale and Specificity:** While large-scale solutions are often sought for societal challenges, the unique local specificities addressed through co-creation might be lost when aiming for broad scalability [00:54:27].
*   **Sustaining Engagement:** Maintaining continuous [[collaboration_and_peer_support_in_innovation | co-creation]] communities is challenging, as many activities are tied to short-term project funding rather than institutionalized long-term visions [01:29:34].

Despite these challenges, developing a common language around "public value" and focusing innovation funds towards this objective can help orient both public and private sectors towards more meaningful and less destructive technological development [01:41:00]. The goal is to move beyond mere "gadgets" to create solutions that genuinely work for society and prevent technologies from undermining democracy [01:42:07].

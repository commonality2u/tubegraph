Inclusive policymaking and community engagement are crucial for building trust in public institutions and ensuring effective public services. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vital role of public trust for policy effectiveness, impacting everything from compliance with restrictions to vaccine uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Public services were adapted during the crisis, often leveraging digital technologies to keep citizens safe and meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. However, a significant risk, evident from past crises like the global financial crisis, is that some citizens may feel alienated or left behind, particularly when public services fail to reach them or meet their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The OECD's trust framework indicates that trust in institutions is driven by the responsiveness and reliability of services, as well as perceptions of their fairness, openness, and integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Innovative and [[inclusive_policy_priorities_and_societal_challenges | inclusive policy-making tools]], such as [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | co-creation processes]], aim to bridge divides across different groups, regions, and public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Impact of Crises on Citizen-Government Relations

The COVID-19 crisis, according to a panel survey in Spain, increased the distance between citizens and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This is reflected in a drop in both external political efficacy (citizens' perception of the political system's openness to their needs) and internal political efficacy (citizens' perception of their capacity to participate or influence politics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

### Key Factors Affecting Trust and Engagement:

*   **Communication:** Governments that communicate timely and clearly, even about difficult news, see citizens follow guidelines and an increase in trust and perceived government performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Telling "difficult truths" can be more effective than downplaying challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>.
*   **[[addressing_inequality_and_inclusion_in_governance | Local Leadership and Community Trust]]:** The importance of local leaders, community-based policies, and community trust has been highlighted during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Focusing and working with communities, as seen in examples like Bangladesh and Sierra Leone, encourages individuals to follow measures and helps with initiatives like vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. The local level is fundamental for building trust, as people often participate more and have better knowledge at this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   **Digitalization:** While [[digital_participation_and_inclusiveness | digitalization]] offers opportunities for cost-free citizen engagement in political discussion, it also carries challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. It can create a gap between citizens and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a> and tends to reproduce existing inequalities, with groups already less represented in politics also being less active online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. However, digitalization has also enabled rapid delivery of public services, such as unemployment benefits in Latvia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
*   **Polarization and Misinformation:** The pandemic has spread polarization across contexts due to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. The proliferation of social media allows everyone to be a "media" outlet, making it difficult to distinguish facts from opinions or "story discussions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. Governments face the challenge of maintaining a clean communication line based on facts, rather than being overly reactive to social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
*   **Governmental Silos:** Competition between government sectors and ministries, each representing different interest groups, can lead to competing interests within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. Breaking down these silos and improving coordination across sectors and government levels is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.

## Strategies for Building Inclusivity and Trust

### Humble Government
A concept of "humble government" is proposed, which involves:
1.  Acknowledging what is not known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>.
2.  Accepting the limits of one's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>.
3.  Publicly recognizing these knowledge gaps as a civil servant or leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.
4.  Having the humbleness to ask for help from citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

This approach encourages listening more, asking more questions, and working collaboratively rather than issuing orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>.

### Empowering Participation and Co-creation
To increase citizen [[democracy_and_public_participation_in_policy | participation]] and political efficacy:
*   **Tailored Engagement:** Recognize that citizens have different desires for engagement, from those who want to participate all the time to those who simply want well-run government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. Mechanisms should be simple enough to communicate what governments do and how <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.
*   **Bottom-Up Approach:** Instead of designing top-down mechanisms, governments should observe and leverage existing ways communities and citizens are already engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
*   **[[inclusive_service_design_in_government | Policy Design (Design Thinking)]]:** This approach involves designing the policymaking process around the people who will use the services and those who will deliver them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. It requires involving all stakeholders (e.g., doctors, nurses, hospital managers, government officials, insurance companies for a salary system) to design solutions together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. Once individuals experience this [[integrating_missionoriented_approaches_in_government_and_policymaking | inclusive design process]], they find it hard to imagine doing it differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.
*   **Continuous Feedback:** Services should be designed as continuous systems where feedback is constantly collected and fed back into the creation process, making people feel heard and strengthening trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

### Tools for Engagement and Empathy
*   **1+2+4 Discussion Method:** A simple but effective tool where participants first think alone, then discuss in pairs, and only then engage in larger group discussions. This gives participants the feeling that their opinions are important and encourages true participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **Empathy Maps:** Stakeholder groups are asked what they think *others* think about them (e.g., a public servant reflecting on what doctors think of them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>. This exercise can be a turning point, opening up discussions about trust and fostering empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

### Future Outlook and Challenges
Despite challenges, the pandemic has clearly highlighted existing problems and the need for adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>. Key challenges for delivering better public services and building more [[inclusive_policy_priorities_and_societal_challenges | inclusive economies]] include:
*   Reaching groups that feel forgotten or left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.
*   A perceived lack of vision and leadership to move away from old ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.
*   The need for different leaders with skills in humility, flexibility, and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>.

It is crucial to avoid reverting to old ways of working post-crisis and instead embed the positive changes and lessons learned, such as prioritizing timely and clear communication, leveraging community trust, and adopting flexible, inclusive policy-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. Empowering public employees and fostering internal government collaboration are also vital for successful external engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.

The concept of "middle management" is often associated with the "clay layer" within bureaucratic and hierarchical organizations, presenting a universal source of frustration in the context of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] [01:22:53]. This challenge is seen not as a contextual issue unique to specific governments, but rather as a structural one inherent to such organizational forms [01:22:56].

## Challenges Associated with Middle Management

Middle management plays a critical role in filtering information, both flowing upwards from lower levels and downwards from the top [01:23:30]. This filtering function can lead to situations where managers are not in a position to accept or absorb new ideas, creating bottlenecks for innovation [01:23:39].

A significant barrier cited is the risk-averse organizational culture often attributed to the Canadian public service [01:03:15]. This risk aversion, while present in various degrees across different public sectors globally, means that the public service will always be conscious of risk [01:03:38]. The challenge then becomes how to balance this inherent risk aversion with the need for [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_organizations | innovative approaches in public sector organizations]] [01:04:28].

## Strategies to Navigate the "Clay Layer"

Addressing the challenges posed by middle management requires strategic interventions to ensure that innovation can flourish.

### Circumventing Bottlenecks
One approach is to question whether bottlenecks can be circumvented [01:23:22]. Since middle management is essential, the focus shifts to creating opportunities for ideas to mature before requiring managerial decision-making [01:23:52].

### Fostering Collaboration and Idea Development
Establishing forums where individuals can circulate, share, and develop their ideas to a more sophisticated level can be beneficial [01:23:42]. Platforms like "GC Connects" and "GC Collab" in Canada are highlighted as examples where people can find allies and refine concepts [01:24:04].

### Balancing Risk and Opportunity
The discussion around risk aversion emphasizes the importance of balancing it by making the "risk of not innovating" more tangible and clearly understood [01:04:33]. Initiatives like the experimentation mandate in Canada are seen as a structural force that normalizes experimentation, thereby reducing perceived risk for individuals [01:05:00]. This approach acknowledges that [[challenges_in_managing_innovation_within_public_sector_organizations | innovation is hard]] and often involves doing new things without guarantees [01:06:10].

### Leveraging Foundational Documents
Public servants are encouraged to refer back to foundational policy documents, guidelines, or interpretation guidance when facing pushback related to risk or scope [01:09:53]. Often, these documents provide significant flexibility in their operationalization, which tends to be "squeezed out" by convention [01:10:19].

### Storytelling and Communication
A key strategy involves the ability to tell a compelling story that resonates with middle management [01:25:04]. This means adapting the narrative to address their primary areas of concern, whether it's risk, communication, policy authorities, engagement, or outcomes [01:25:17]. The message needs to be tailored to the specific audience, understanding that a briefing for an Assistant Deputy Minister will differ from one for a Deputy Minister or a Minister [01:25:56]. This skill helps overcome objections and move [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] forward [01:26:24].

Ultimately, public servants should actively assess their existing "remit for change" and pursue it to the extent possible, rather than always waiting for explicit permission that might already be implied [01:13:35]. The aim is to empower individuals to see themselves as part of the [[public_sector_innovation | innovation system]] and contribute to shaping it, rather than feeling powerless [01:42:49].

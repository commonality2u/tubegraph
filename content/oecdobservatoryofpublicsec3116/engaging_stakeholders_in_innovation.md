Innovation within government is not merely about novel ideas; it requires implementation and ultimately must lead to an impact that shifts public value or improves public outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. While often perceived as a niche activity, particularly in government, innovation can be a strategic resource that improves public services and the lives of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. Effective [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | stakeholder engagement]] is crucial to achieving this, moving innovation beyond individual efforts to a systemic, collective activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

## Why Engage Stakeholders?
Engaging diverse [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | stakeholders]] is vital for several reasons:
*   **Keeping Pace with Change** Governments must proactively engage with new technology, opportunities, and approaches, especially in contexts of uncertainty and volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Building Trust** Innovation helps design and deliver services that genuinely meet citizen needs, fostering trust between governments and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Exploring Uncertainty** Innovation provides a resource to explore uncertainty, engage with possible futures, and steer towards preferred outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Improving Public Value** Ultimately, governments serve the people, and innovation is about improving public services and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

The cost of inaction is much higher than the cost of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. As Prime Minister Janice Johnson stated, "If we only deal with the consequences we will never solve the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Innovation Facets and Stakeholder Engagement
The OPSI (Observatory of Public Sector Innovation) identifies different types of innovation activities that require varied levels of stakeholder involvement:

*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>: Characterized by "quick wins" and doing things better, this often involves incremental improvements to services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. A key aspect is strong user involvement and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>. For example, Estonia's proactive family benefit system automatically offers services to families when a baby is born, reducing burden on recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

*   **Adaptive Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>: Involves adjusting to constantly changing circumstances, such as the shift to telework or adapting communication strategies based on new media consumption habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Japan's agile governance model, a constant cycle of understanding changing conditions and developing new systems, exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. This requires continuous feedback and collaboration to inform policy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>: A powerful approach for addressing complex challenges like climate change, it involves a large range of [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | stakeholders]] who collectively define problems, develop solutions, and implement and understand their impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This requires engaging researchers, academia, the private sector, and civil society, facilitated by coordinated and collaborative mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

*   **Anticipatory Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>: Focuses on engaging with uncertainty and working with the future by creating evidence about potential futures in the present to inform decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Slovenia's strategic foresight exercise imagined four different future "worlds" to understand implications for the public sector regarding aging and talent management, requiring diverse perspectives to explore potential scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

## Building Blocks for Stakeholder Engagement
Panelists from Belgium, Denmark, and Slovenia shared their experiences in building successful environments for innovation through [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | stakeholder engagement]]:

*   **Networks and Platforms**
    *   **Belgium:** The Naido public sector innovation lab facilitates innovation by focusing on challenge-driven processes. It hosts "Go Buys Innovation," a marketplace for public sector experimentation, and a network to share knowledge and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. They act as facilitators, matchmakers, and knowledge brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
    *   **Slovenia:** The innovative.si project emphasizes an innovation community platform for networking, learning, support, and sharing good practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. Their "Partnership for Change" program fosters cooperation between public administration and the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>.
    *   **Denmark:** Has a long history of [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation | digital government]] built on collaborative work across silos involving the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. The National Center for Public Sector Innovation is funded by municipal, regional, and state levels, supporting innovation across all government levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

*   **Empowering Individuals and Teams**
    *   **Slovenia:** Focuses on providing knowledge and competences through training programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. They also empower "innovation ambassadors" (currently 70) who act as entry points in their institutions and promote problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.
    *   **General:** Skilled and motivated people are key to better solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>. This includes promoting "social innovation skills" like collaboration, inclusion, co-creation, and system thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.

*   **Political and Leadership Support**
    *   **Denmark:** Politicians are accountable for public sector productivity and services, making their inclusion in innovation work critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. Supporting political leadership and strengthening collaboration between civil servants and politicians is a strong focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
    *   **Slovenia:** Recognizing the need for financial and political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.
    *   **General:** Effective [[role_of_leadership_in_fostering_innovation | leadership]] involves giving autonomy and entrepreneurship to civil servants while maintaining control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

## Addressing Barriers to Engagement
Common [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_innovation | barriers to innovation]] and stakeholder engagement include strict hierarchies, risk avoidance, skills gaps, lack of vision, and the "magnetism of business as usual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.

*   **Mindset and Culture:** The biggest barrier is often mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>. It's crucial to cultivate a culture of openness, where new ideas and solutions are accepted, and mistakes are allowed as part of a learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Hierarchies:** Hierarchical approaches can hinder the use of employee potential and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>. The solution lies in promoting self-organized teams and progressive organizations with high levels of transparency and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.
*   **Engaging Management and Leaders:**
    *   **Connect to their Objectives:** Understand what is important to them by listening, reading their management plans, and connecting innovation initiatives to their stated objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>.
    *   **Build Trust:** Gain access to management informally and formally to build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. Engage all important [[stakeholders_in_healthcare_innovation | stakeholders]], listen to their arguments, and address their concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Results:** Tell stories that highlight tangible results and learnings from innovation early on, rather than just focusing on the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.
    *   **Problem-Oriented Approach:** Frame innovation as a means to solve specific, visible problems that resonate with politicians and senior managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>. This turns innovation into a tool for fixing real-world issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

*   **Leveraging Regulation:** An effective legal framework that encourages innovation and experimentation is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>. Denmark's "free municipality experiments" allow municipalities to be exempt from certain regulations to try out new approaches, creating a structural framework for experimentation and a cultural mandate for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

## Systemic Support for Innovation
To ensure the [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | innovation agenda]] is systemically supported, rather than relying on individuals:
*   **Community Building:** Create broad networks and communities that include [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | stakeholders]] from all sectors (public, private, academic, end-users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>.
*   **Empowerment:** Empowering individuals, such as "innovation ambassadors" who have influence within their institutions, can decentralize and strengthen the innovation culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>.
*   **Clear Ownership and Mandate:** It is crucial to have project sponsors who are committed to designing, delivering, and implementing solutions, and who have the mandate to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>.
*   **Measuring Maturity:** Measuring innovation maturity in state administration bodies helps monitor progress and demonstrates the impact of systematic efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.

Ultimately, "you start by starting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>. Find opportunities, build a "coalition of the willing" with open mindsets, and focus on innovation that addresses core business challenges, making it an essential part of public sector operations rather than an optional "whipped cream" addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>. The current global context, with available funding and renewed energy post-crisis, presents a significant opportunity to carry this agenda forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>.

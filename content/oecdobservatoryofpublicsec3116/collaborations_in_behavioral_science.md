Collaboration is a critical aspect of advancing [[behavioral_science_in_policy_making | behavioral science]] in public policy, especially during crises and for long-term development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. It enables sharing of insights, resources, and best practices, and helps address complex challenges.

## Types of Collaboration

### Cross-Sector Collaboration
During crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a remarkable level of cross-sector collaboration between academics, government, and, in some cases, the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. This collaborative spirit, driven by a shared focus on addressing immediate challenges, is a legacy that behavioral insights (BI) teams aim to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Strong ties and quick mobilization of researchers for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.
*   Working with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and implementation partners, particularly in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.
*   The Ministry of Health in Qatar thinking in a very [[behavioral_science_in_policy_making | behavioral science]] way, working with experts to inform communication strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.

### International and Inter-Country Collaboration
International cooperation is highly valued as countries often face similar challenges simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. Key aspects include:
*   **Information Exchange:** Sharing insights and best practices among BI practitioners from different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.
*   **Learning from Others:** Contextualizing lessons learned from one country (e.g., India, Brazil, Canada, France) to another's reality to avoid duplicating efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Shared Challenges:** Realizing that other BI teams face similar difficulties, such as the limited time for [[empirical_evidence_in_behavioral_science | rigorous experimentation]] during crises, can be reassuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.
*   **Global South Focus:** Expanding collaboration among countries in the Global South to exchange ideas, build on each other's work, and share undocumented lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.
*   **Virtual Connectivity:** The pandemic has highlighted the ease of virtual interactions (e.g., Zoom calls) to connect with experts and peers globally, regardless of geographical distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>.

### Inter-Disciplinary Collaboration
Solving complex policy problems requires a multi-pronged approach that integrates various disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. This includes:
*   Working with data specialists, organizational behavior experts, and health and social development professionals within cross-disciplinary teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.
*   Recognizing that while [[application_of_behavioral_science | behavioral science]] can be a useful tool, it cannot fit all problems and may need to be complemented by other policy or regulatory responses, or even service delivery model redesign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.
*   Building connections with Cambridge researchers on topics like inoculation theory and psychological vaccines to combat misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>.

### Collaboration with On-the-Ground Practitioners
Gathering insights from people "on the field" (e.g., teachers, nurses) is crucial, as their knowledge is extremely relevant, pragmatic, and valuable, yet often underrepresented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>. Understanding the perspectives of those being served helps in comprehending the underlying reasons for behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>.

## Benefits of Collaboration

*   **Rapid Learning:** Teams can quickly adapt and understand unfamiliar areas by collaborating with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.
*   **Shared Standards:** Developing shared standards and labels for the type of evidence delivered (e.g., based on surveys, interviews, or [[empirical_evidence_in_behavioral_science | Randomized Control Trials (RCTs)]]) can promote quality and manage expectations with policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>.
*   **Capacity Building:** Collaboration, especially with academia, is essential for building a new generation of [[behavioral_science_in_public_governance | behaviorally-informed government officials]] and scaling up the use of [[behavioral_science_in_public_governance | behavioral science]] within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.
*   **Addressing Complex Problems:** Collaborative approaches, integrating behavioral insights into broader policy responses, can tackle complex issues like gender-based violence and early childhood development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

## Role of Organizations (e.g., OECD)

Organizations like the OECD can support governments in applying behavioral insights by:
*   Facilitating networks and communities for practitioners to exchange experiences and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.
*   Creating a "what works" center or go-to resources for best practices during crises (e.g., compliance with health measures, effective communication strategies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>.
*   Developing platforms for experts and practitioners to answer questions rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.
*   Continuing to develop and share standards, such as [[ethics_in_behavioral_insights | ethical standards]] and quality indicators for recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.
*   Encouraging pre-registration of trials within the BI community to assess the accuracy of intuitions and predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

### Personal Commitments to Collaboration

Research conducted in the Slovak public administration investigated how to empower public sector employees to detect and report corruption risks, specifically examining the impact of age on this willingness to communicate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>.

## Key Findings

The study found a significant correlation between age and the likelihood of reporting corruption risks:
*   Younger respondents were more likely to communicate a corruption risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>.
*   The older the respondent, the less likely they were to communicate a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.
*   An increase in age by one year was associated with a decrease of approximately 0.23 percentage points in the likelihood to communicate an integrity risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:27">[01:21:27]</a>.
*   Career length in public administration, however, did not correlate with the likelihood to communicate a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>.
*   Senior respondents were also less likely to feel safe when considering communicating a risk, especially after being prompted to specify whom they would report to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12">[01:22:12]</a>.

## Hypothesized Reasons for Age Effect

Several potential reasons were discussed to explain why younger civil servants might be more willing to report corruption risks compared to their older, more senior counterparts:

*   **Fear of Retaliation and Reputational Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>
    *   More senior individuals may experience a greater fear of retaliation due to their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>.
    *   Their reputational risk is also greater, potentially leading to hesitation in speaking out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:42">[01:22:42]</a>.
    *   The opportunity cost of reporting may be higher for senior civil servants, as they might fear being perceived as a "rat" in their department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:46">[01:23:46]</a>.

*   **Status Quo Bias** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:46">[01:22:46]</a>
    *   Individuals who have been in the administration for a longer period might exhibit a status quo bias, meaning they have less incentive to initiate change or speak up about issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>.
    *   They may have observed similar behaviors throughout their careers and become accustomed to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

*   **Differing Beliefs and Exposure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>
    *   Senior civil servants may have been exposed to corrupt practices or unethical behaviors more frequently over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>. This exposure could shape their beliefs about what is right or wrong, and how useful reporting would be, differing from the beliefs held by junior civil servants who have not yet experienced such exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>.

*   **Sociocultural Context and Changing Ethical Norms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>
    *   Younger generations may have greater exposure to broader communication about ethical conduct and integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.
    *   They might feel more entitled to "rightfulness" and [[strategies_for_enhancing_public_sector_integrity | integrity]] due to a different sociocultural context across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>.
    *   The ethical standards themselves are evolving; what was considered ethical 20 or 30 years ago might be deemed unethical today, creating a gap between generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>. This aligns with observations from the Civil Service Council, where the positive view of things tends to decrease the longer one serves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a>.

## Implications for Policy

These findings suggest that [[strategies_for_enhancing_public_sector_integrity | strategies for enhancing public sector integrity]] and addressing [[corruption_risk_management_in_slovakia | corruption risk management in Slovakia]] should consider generational differences. Policies should aim to create an environment where all public officials, regardless of age or seniority, feel safe and encouraged to report potential risks. This includes focusing on leadership examples, clear reporting channels, and fostering a culture of psychological safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>. The importance of education, starting from universities and high schools, was also highlighted to cultivate a better understanding of integrity and risk management from an early age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:23">[01:28:23]</a>.

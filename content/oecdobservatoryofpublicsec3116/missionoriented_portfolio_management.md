[[Innovation portfolio management | Innovation portfolio management]] and stewardship for collective system change is an emerging practice that governments are increasingly focusing on due to the accelerating pace of change and diversifying problems, which necessitate a tailored approach to public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The key to this practice is intentionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## OECD's Innovation Facets Model
The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) has developed an Innovation Facets Model to help clarify, make sense of, and orient future action in [[innovation_portfolio_management | portfolio management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This model differentiates between four types of innovation based on their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>:
*   **[[Mission_oriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]]** is directed towards overall challenges and societal goals, often in a top-down, directed manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation** focuses on improving existing practices to make them more efficient and widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation** addresses new or expressed needs by creating spaces for bottom-up exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation** involves shaping changes based on potential future events, particularly in contexts of extreme uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

This framework is used to frame important conversations and seed action around portfolios, helping to clarify existing practices and their purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Key Research Questions and Challenges
Research into [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolio management]] highlights several challenges organizations face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>:
*   **Influences on Portfolio**: What conditions or requirements led to the current portfolio, such as policy context, organizational environment, or goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>?
*   **Stewardship**: Who is explicitly or implicitly stewarding the portfolio and overseeing the bigger picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>?
*   **Strategies and Policies**: Are there strategies supporting each innovation facet, and which facets tend to be strongest in organizations (e.g., efficiency-led organizations may excel in enhancement-oriented innovation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>?
*   **Balance and Alignment**: Is the current balance of the portfolio indicative of a temporary or long-term trend, and is it supportive of the overall organizational remit or public purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>?
*   **Ecosystem Actors**: What roles do different ecosystem actors play in shaping the portfolio, and how do external influences and partners impact it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>? This leads to the need for roles to steward portfolios both within organizations and wider ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Driving Portfolio Transitions
Various factors can drive portfolio transitions, including scandals, societal changes, and technology shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The key question is whether the organization has the right mix of options and choices for its context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This involves understanding the forces, structures, processes, aptitudes, preferences, and circumstances that push innovative activity in different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. There is always an [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolio]], whether intentional or not, and organizations must decide if they are satisfied with it and what mix they *should* have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. The "should" question is often political, related to which public values are prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

## Stewardship at the System Level
Innovation can pull a system in different directions, potentially threatening its overall coherence and compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>. The need for innovation continuously changes, and while no one can completely control an innovation system, an overall view and some form of stewardship at the collective level are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.

Emerging practices for stewardship include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>:
*   **Legitimacy for Transitioning**: How to gain legitimacy for doing new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.
*   **Analysis and Decision Support**: The type of analysis and decision-making support that exists, indicating capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.
*   **Holistic Support Structures**: Having differentiated support structures for all facets of innovation (e.g., [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented]], enhancement, anticipatory, adaptive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>.
*   **Diverse Capabilities and Integrator Roles**: The need for diverse capabilities and roles that connect different purposes to prevent fragmentation and ensure activities remain linked to the core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>.
*   **Cooperation and Knowledge Sharing**: Establishing structures and systems for ongoing sense-making and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>.

The challenge is amplified in multi-stakeholder environments or ecosystems where no single organization or individual has absolute control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. Advancing this work requires understanding different roles, driving collective action, and building/sustaining momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>.

## Case Studies from Sweden

### Viable Cities
Viable Cities is a program in Sweden with the mission of achieving climate-neutral cities by 2030, aiming for "a good life for all within planetary boundaries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. It operates with a [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented approach]] that focuses on systems transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

#### Purpose of Portfolio Strategy
The main purpose for Viable Cities is to align climate transition and sustainability efforts to contribute more impactfully to their mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. This addresses fragmentation, projectification, and the lack of directionality in current research, innovation, and implementation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

#### Key Approaches and Tools
*   **Mission as Direction**: The mission of climate-neutral cities provides a clear direction, allowing for flexibility in methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:14">[01:24:14]</a>.
*   **Climate City Contract**: This is a core tool, a negotiated document that assigns commitments to both national-level government agencies and cities (initially nine, expanding to twenty) for faster climate transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. It stewards ownership and commitments, revised and signed yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.
*   **Transition Labs**: Mechanisms for accelerating learning, clarifying common direction, leveraging synergies, renewing decision-making processes, and building dynamic capabilities for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Portfolio of Portfolios**: Viable Cities recognizes that achieving its mission requires aligning and connecting efforts across different actors and governance levels, viewing its work as a "portfolio of portfolios" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>. This includes thinking about "open interfaces" between portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
*   **City-level Centrality**: Given the mission of climate-neutral *cities*, city-level portfolios are central, but the principle applies to any mission-driven effort, where a certain level becomes more central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.
*   **Working with Barriers**: Embracing barriers helps focus efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.
*   **Focus on Cities/Needs**: High emphasis is placed on cities and their citizens' needs, with municipalities at the center as facilitators of the wider multi-stakeholder approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.
*   **Open Calls**: Using open calls helps identify committed partners across countries (e.g., Brazil, Uganda, Colombia, UK) for initiatives like the Climate Smart Cities Challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Grants**: Grant funding is used as a lever to trigger innovations in urban governance and learn from dialogues with stakeholders to influence future grant calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>.

### Future by Lund
Future by Lund is an innovation platform within the Municipality of Lund, Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. It connects companies, organizations, city departments, and universities in a multi-stakeholder environment where trust, negotiation, and timing are key, as no one entity has sole decision-making power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. The platform operates on the understanding that organizations will move in and out of initiatives based on their own logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>.

#### Why a Portfolio Approach?
Future by Lund adopted a portfolio approach to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>:
*   Create structure and process for identifying common problems, barriers, and opportunities for collective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.
*   Enable curation and strategic development of activities across multiple organizations, actor groups, and thematic boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>.
*   Communicate collective assets, portfolios of activities, and the strength of the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   Bundle results from contributing actors to trace system-level transformation over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

#### Key Approaches and Tools
*   **Common Vocabulary and Frame of Reference**: Establishing a shared understanding of what a portfolio is and its purpose for the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. This foundational step enables collective management and movement of the portfolio over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.
*   **Visualization Tools**: Using models like the OPSI Innovation Facets Model, often overlaid with their own "zone model" (yellow for uncertain/exploratory, green for concept/project, blue for upscaling/business integration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. These visuals help identify strengths, weaknesses, gaps, and areas for strategic investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. The goal is to move projects from the "exploring side" to the "impacting and using" side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>.
*   **"Playing Field" Discussions**: Using the visualization as a "playing field" to discuss how to move activities in desired directions, identify necessary functions and collaborations, and understand priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:04">[01:30:04]</a>.
*   **Facilitation Role**: The core team acts as facilitators, focusing on understanding individual and organizational needs through constant dialogue ("drinking coffee and having meetings") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. They match ideas with resources, inject pre-studies, and build social capital within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>.
*   **Neutrality and Transparency**: Operating as a neutral entity that doesn't own or earn money from initiatives allows them to work in the gaps between different sectors (business, city, university) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>.
*   **Team with Complementary Skills**: A small team with diverse technical and social capital-building skills is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>.
*   **"Barbecue Model"**: The goal is to bring people who want something into the same room or place, fostering a common value system and feeling of collaboration, knowing that impact will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>.

## Evaluation and Impact in Mission-Oriented Portfolios
Evaluating [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] and transformative change is challenging using standard models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>. It's not just about cutting CO2 emissions, but building the "muscle" for transformative change and enhancing collective learning capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>.

### Approaches to Tracking Progress
*   **Layer Model**: Inspired by Vinnova's Vinnväxt program, this model tracks leverage effects of investments. It consists of layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>:
    1.  Base investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.
    2.  Projects where the main organization or partners are actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>.
    3.  Additional projects initiated by other partners in the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.
    4.  Qualitative storytelling of critical events that represent system change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.
    This approach uses project investments as a proxy for gathering force around a theme and tracking changes in collaborative partners and funders, providing quantitative and qualitative insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **Process Tracking**: Instead of traditional evaluation, the focus is on tracking transformative change processes in a structured way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:42">[01:45:42]</a>. This involves establishing strategic directions, agreeing on indicators of success, and continuously revisiting progress with stakeholders to inform future action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:53">[01:45:53]</a>.
*   **Learning Histories**: An experimental practice involving reflective sessions or workshops where stakeholders come together to analyze what is happening and learn from their practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>. The aim is to institutionalize this reflexivity within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:37">[01:56:37]</a>.

### Political Communication and Legitimacy
For long-term, complex missions with potentially invisible or unusual results, maintaining political legitimacy is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:07">[01:49:07]</a>.
*   **Higher-Level Mandates**: Pointing to overarching national or EU policies provides a stable framework, especially when local political questions fluctuate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:41">[01:49:41]</a>. These higher-level goals help legitimize local initiatives and encourage local politicians to align with broader mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:02">[01:50:02]</a>.
*   **Multiple Purposes/Outcomes**: Framing climate transition as also creating "better daily lives for citizens" helps broaden appeal and legitimacy by encompassing multiple desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Shared Understanding**: Creating a common language and visual tools (like the Innovation Facets Model) to explain why risky, exploratory projects are undertaken, how they fit into the larger portfolio, and how different activities contribute collectively helps maintain legitimacy across different levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:48">[01:53:48]</a>.

## OECD Resources
The OECD OPSI offers several tools for [[innovation_portfolio_management | portfolio management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:43">[01:57:43]</a>:
*   **Innovation Portfolio Exploration Workshop**: A gamified, downloadable resource (printable or online) to make sense of a portfolio from a project perspective, test transitions, and identify leverageable assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:49">[01:57:49]</a>.
*   **Self-Service Portfolio Exploration Tool**: For a quick snapshot of how support structures and activities might influence portfolio direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:24">[01:58:24]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Exploration Tool Guide**: For facilitating discussions around portfolio topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:43">[01:58:43]</a>.

These resources, along with ongoing research and a planned community of practice, aim to advance the practice of [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolio management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:08">[02:00:08]</a>.

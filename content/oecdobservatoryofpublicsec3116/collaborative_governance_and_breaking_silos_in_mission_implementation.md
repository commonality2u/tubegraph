The conference "Government Beyond Recovery: Panel Anticipation to Bold Missions" highlights the critical need for collaborative governance and [[breaking_silos_in_government_for_technology_futures | breaking silos]] to effectively implement bold, future-ready missions [00:00:05]. Emerging from the COVID-19 crisis, there is an opportunity to think about new missions to prevent future global crises [00:00:26].

## The Role of Missions and Governance

Missions are defined as broad, objective statements set with a timeline, providing direction and intentionality for future goals [01:39:00]. The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the Missions Action Lab are actively working on how to implement these missions iteratively and in an agile manner [02:41:00].

A key aspect of successful mission implementation is the establishment of robust [[Governance structures and policy coordination in missions | governance structures and policy coordination in missions | governance systems]] [00:04:38]. The European Commission, for example, has launched five significant missions under the Horizon Europe program, with an approach designed to integrate these missions across the EU's policy agenda [00:04:15]. These missions serve as a signaling mechanism for important investment areas for EU countries [00:07:06].

## Co-creation and Collaborative Approach

A fundamental principle for mission success is their co-creation by different actors [01:41:00]. This co-development is crucial for achieving shared objectives and securing commitment from all stakeholders [01:42:00]. Variations in this co-creation process include:
*   Formal structures of [[Governance structures and policy coordination in missions | governance structures and policy coordination in missions | governance]], such as Japan's "visionary council" that includes diverse stakeholders like science fiction novelists to foster new options and future thinking [01:48:00].
*   Online consultations, workshops, and deep dives, as seen in the UK, Sweden, and other Nordic countries [01:53:00].

In Denmark, the Innovation Fund insists on building partnerships around each mission, where the entire ecosystem—companies, public administration, private investors, and researchers—co-creates the roadmap [03:36:00]. This collaborative approach helps align diverse partners with the overarching targets and ambitions, enabling a shared understanding of how to achieve goals [03:37:00].

### Avoiding "Mission Washing"

A significant danger is "mission washing," where organizations label existing activities as "missions" without genuinely changing how they operate or deliver new inventions [01:16:18]. To counter this, missions must genuinely drive different actions and challenge the status quo [01:16:38].

## Embracing Agility and Foresight

Given the inherent uncertainty of the future, missions must be adaptable and dynamic [01:14:00]. This requires:
*   **Agile and iterative practices**: Missions need to be developed in an agile and iterative way, continuously adapting to changing conditions [01:06:00].
*   **Regular stress testing**: Missions should be periodically stress-tested to prevent lock-in to initial assumptions, especially given continuous change in areas like climate, economic, health, and societal challenges [02:09:00].
*   **Integrated foresight**: Integrating foresight into mission development is crucial. This involves analyzing driving forces for change, potential impacts, reframing future contexts through scenarios, and developing future personas to challenge assumptions and inform present actions [02:17:00]. For instance, Norway is using strategic foresight to future-proof seamless services for citizens [01:17:21].
*   **Learning mindset**: Governance models and investment plans should allow for a learning mindset, acknowledging that the exact path in five years may be unknown [03:06:00]. This means allowing for experimentation and adapting mechanisms for financing, evaluating, and driving initiatives [03:12:00]. Denmark's approach of "building the road while driving on it" exemplifies this iterative development [03:37:00].

### Addressing Incumbent Bias and New Actors

To counteract incumbent bias and ensure new partners and businesses can emerge, collaboration should be fostered through intense dialogue [03:59:00]. It's crucial to challenge existing perspectives by including partners who approach mission-driven innovation differently [03:50:00]. This can involve:
*   **[[International Collaboration on Governance Innovation | International collaboration on governance innovation | International collaboration]]**: Sharing learnings and driving progress across countries [04:02:00].
*   **[[Crossdisciplinary collaboration for mission success | Crossdisciplinary collaboration for mission success | Crossdisciplinary collaboration]]**: Encouraging the integration of social sciences and humanities alongside technological solutions, as consumer behavior is vital for successful implementation [04:19:00].

## Overcoming Silos in Government

Mission implementation often requires breaking down traditional departmental and topical silos within government [01:10:01]. This is particularly true for complex challenges like climate change, which has profound impacts on citizens' well-being [01:09:52].
*   **Beyond technological solutions**: While many missions, particularly in climate, are technologically focused, there's a need to venture into behavioral dimensions, changing social norms, and population habits to ensure well-being is preserved and transitions are smoother [01:10:50].
*   **Long-term thinking**: Missions, by their nature, foster long-term thinking, which can help overcome short-term political cycles [01:15:00]. Establishing institutions for the long term and promoting [[Intergenerational fairness and future-oriented governance | intergenerational fairness]] are critical for sustaining mission impact [01:16:00].
*   **[[Public sector adoption of mission oriented approaches | Leadership and collaboration in public service | Leadership and collaboration in public service | Leadership and political commitment]]**: Strong political and financial leadership is essential to maintain ambition and ensure the public good perspective is integrated into co-creation processes [01:00:27]. This includes engaging with parliament and seeking bipartisan support to champion the agenda [01:56:00].

## Dealing with "Failure" and Learning

The concept of "failure" in missions is complex and not binary [01:16:16]. Instead of viewing it as outright failure, it's about recognizing aspects that succeed or don't prosper within a challenging, disruptive process [01:16:00]. Key approaches include:
*   **Performance measurement and governance**: Systems should be attuned to allow for experimentation, recognizing that not all elements will proceed as planned [01:16:40]. A "culture of cooperation" should be fostered to avoid blame [01:16:57].
*   **Reflectivity and evaluation**: Continuous evaluation is essential for learning from experiences, especially given the short track record of many mission-oriented policies [01:20:14].
*   **Exit strategies**: Having an "exit strategy" can help manage missions that need to be re-evaluated or discontinued, ensuring that efforts are repurposed rather than completely abandoned. An example is Norway's CCS mission, which was scaled down but later revived as "Northern Light" [01:20:29].
*   **Unintended benefits**: Missions can yield unexpected benefits and new technologies even if initial goals are not fully met (e.g., the internet and mobile phones from Cold War-era missions) [01:17:51].
*   **Inclusive design**: Ensuring that all stakeholders, including those representing potential second and third-order impacts, are "in the room" during mission design can prevent unforeseen challenges and ensure broader societal benefits [01:19:19].

Ultimately, the future of effective governance lies in continuously learning, adapting, and fostering widespread [[Crossdisciplinary collaboration for mission success | collaboration across sectors]] and generations [01:25:00].

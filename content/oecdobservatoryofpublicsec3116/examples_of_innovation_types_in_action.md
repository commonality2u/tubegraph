[[Types and purposes of innovation in the public sector | Public sector innovation]] is defined as something novel in its context, implemented, and bringing about a shift in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This type of innovation can vary greatly in size and certainty, emerging from either a top-down directed approach or a bottom-up undirected method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

To make sense of the many facets of [[types of innovation within public sector organizations | public sector innovation]], the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation developed a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This model is based on two core features: how directed the innovation is and how uncertain its process is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. From these features, four distinct facets or types of [[types_of_public_sector_innovation | innovation]] emerge:

*   Enhancement-Oriented Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Mission-Oriented Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   Anticipatory Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   [[Adaptive innovation | Adaptive Innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

## Types of Innovation and Examples

### Enhancement-Oriented Innovation
This type of innovation aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing products, services, and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Example**: Using behavioural insights to encourage people to pay their taxes on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Mission-Oriented Innovation
Mission-oriented innovation is focused on solving specific problems and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Historical Example**: The past efforts that enabled humans to reach the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Contemporary Example**: The current transition to sustainable energy sources to counteract climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Anticipatory Innovation
Anticipatory innovation seeks to influence future developments before they become fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Example**: Exploring the ethical and technological boundaries that artificial intelligence projects should adhere to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### [[Understanding adaptive innovation | Adaptive Innovation]]
[[Adaptive innovation | Adaptive innovation]] involves the exploration of what is possible, functioning as a process of discovery for what could be or might be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Example**: The emergence of social media, which introduced new ways for government and citizens to interact, thereby reshaping citizen expectations and creating new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This is an example of [[adaptive_innovation_examples_in_regulatory_systems | adaptive innovation within regulatory systems]].

Given the multifaceted nature of innovation, there is no single, universally applicable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Focusing on only one or two facets can lead to uneven [[innovation_strategies | innovation efforts]] and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Therefore, governments need a balanced [[innovation_strategies | innovation portfolio]] that covers all innovation facets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

The "Digitally Enabled State of the Government Aftershock Conference" by the OECD brought together over 4,000 people across more than 60 events in 17 countries to discuss the role of data in strengthening government resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Key themes that emerged include the necessity to foster learning, experimentation, and creativity within public sectors, alongside an urgent need for transformational change to strengthen government resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The aim is to make governments more agile, people-oriented, and collaborative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. A central question explored was how data and its improved use can address these persistent challenges and foster conditions for governments to respond more effectively to societal and economic needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Unprecedented Acceleration of Digital Transformation

Despite long-standing challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]] within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Governments worldwide rapidly harnessed data to identify health hotspots, locate medical supplies, deploy first responders, and facilitate vaccine distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This period saw more transformation in two months than in the previous 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Case Studies in Data-Driven Response

### Singapore's Contact Tracing Success
Singapore's experience during the pandemic highlighted the importance of data for rapid response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Faced with the highly infectious nature of the virus, manual contact tracing proved too slow, taking five to six days to gather credible data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. In response, the Government Technology Agency developed the "TraceTogether" app in just four weeks, demonstrating that governments can act in weeks, not months or years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

The app, along with a physical token for those without smartphones, achieved approximately 60% population coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This widespread adoption reduced the contact tracing cycle from five-six days to approximately 1.2 days, effectively cutting transmission chains and enabling rapid quarantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Crucially, data privacy was respected, as data is only downloaded when a person tests positive for COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Singapore's success, with zero community transmissions for weeks, demonstrates the potential of effective data use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

This success was built on several foundational elements of data governance:
*   **Government Data Architecture:** Focusing on single sources of truth for data, such as addresses, to avoid duplication and ensure accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>.
*   **Trusted Data Centers:** Establishing secure centers for data preservation, maintenance, and timely access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   **Data Exchange Gateway (APEX):** Building an API gateway four years prior, which now hosts nearly 3,000 datasets and handles 600 million calls monthly, allowing for rapid data sharing between agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.
*   **Skills Development:** Training approximately 20,000 civil servants over four years to use data effectively and ask the right questions to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.
*   **Political Support:** Strong support from top leadership, including the Prime Minister, for investing in critical digital infrastructure for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.

### UK's Shielding Support
The UK government quickly mobilized to support 2.2 million clinically extremely vulnerable individuals requiring shielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This involved providing state-wide support like food parcels, priority supermarket slots, and local authority assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Data sharing agreements, which typically take months, were completed in hundreds within weeks, driven by the urgency of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This rapid action, while adhering to data protection legislation and ethics frameworks, highlights the ability to work at pace when there is a clear shared purpose, shared objectives, and understanding of the legislative, security, and ethical landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

## Challenges and Areas for Improvement

### Cultural and Administrative Barriers
In France, the crisis revealed cultural and administrative barriers to data use and collaboration with civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The administration was slow to release open health data, while civil society quickly crowdsourced and shared information on store openings, mask availability, and testing sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. The government's initial reluctance to validate civil society-developed digital travel waivers eventually yielded to public adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. This suggests governments were often "one step behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

### Trust and Transparency
Lack of transparent data from the French government contributed to public mistrust, with only 35% of French people trusting the government's handling of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Contradictory information fostered confusion and provided fertile ground for conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. This underscores the need for clear, timely information to protect democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>.

### The "Fun" Element in Public Policy
Inspired by Taiwan's "fast, fair, and fun" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, the idea of incorporating humor and gamification into public policy was discussed. For example, a German government video humorously encouraged young people to be "heroes" by staying home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. In contrast, the French contact tracing app, "StopCovid," faced low adoption (only 1% of cases traced) partly due to a lack of trust and an overly serious, guilt-inducing communication approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. Gamification, such as showing users how many people they crossed paths with and encouraging minimization, could increase engagement and data collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

### Formulating Clear Data Questions
Governments need to become more sophisticated in formulating specific questions for which data can provide answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. During the pandemic, there was a massive willingness to help, but often no clear signal from governments about their data needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. Sourcing these questions internally and externally, and building collaborations around them, would lead to faster and more sophisticated insights, addressing a wider range of issues beyond epidemiology, such as school openings or misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

### Privacy and Ethical Concerns
The choice of a centralized infrastructure for France's contact tracing app raised concerns about vulnerability to attacks and leaks of sensitive health data, impacting public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. The shift to remote work also exposed vulnerabilities, with judicial system files being mailed via Gmail due to VPN saturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. The rapid deployment of new technologies like facial recognition in subways to detect mask-wearing or drones to control lockdown compliance raised significant ethical and regulatory questions regarding privacy, surveillance, and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.

## Pillars for Future Data-Driven Public Sector

The public poll results emphasized key priorities for achieving a data-driven public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:5:02">[00:5:02]</a>:
1.  **Clear Strategic Vision:** Formulate a clear strategic vision to leverage data as a key strategic asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
2.  **Legal and Regulatory Frameworks:** Update current legal and regulatory frameworks for data access and sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.
3.  **Sound Data Infrastructures:** Build sound, scalable public sector data infrastructures (e.g., cloud storage, APIs, metadata sharing platforms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.

These align with core elements of data governance, which must encompass vision, strategy, legal frameworks, and infrastructure.

### Enhancing Public-Private Data Collaborations
The pandemic spurred many [[public_sector_and_technology_integration | public-private data collaboratives]], but these efforts remain largely ad hoc and challenging to establish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>. Barriers include lengthy data sharing agreements and lack of clear points of contact within the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. To make data collaboration systematic, sustainable, and responsible, a "human infrastructure" is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. The concept of "Chief Data Stewards" was proposed – a dedicated function within organizations (distinct from Chief Data Officers) responsible for building external relationships, figuring out appropriate conditions for data access, coordinating internal sign-offs, and ensuring data is used for public interest and social good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.

### The Role of International Cooperation
Despite national successes, significant work remains to enable the trusted, free flow of data at a global level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>. International cooperation is crucial for addressing global challenges like vaccine distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. Technology companies are embedding privacy protection into their solutions to allow for trusted extraction of insights from data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. There is a call for stronger global public-private-civil society relationships and working methods to tackle cross-agency and cross-industry challenges that impact all human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>.

## Looking Ahead: Sustaining the Momentum
While the crisis exposed challenges like bureaucracy, silos, and limited infrastructure, it also demonstrated the art of the possible, as seen with remote work rollouts happening in days instead of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>. This "wave" of [[public_sector_transformation_postcrisis | transformation postcrisis]] might not be enough to completely eradicate entrenched issues, but it represents an important first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>. The pandemic proved data's value as a critical asset for addressing uncertainty and solving critical problems, reinforcing the need to invest in foundational data infrastructure, policy, and human capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>.

The future of [[public_sector_digital_transformation_strategies | public sector digital transformation strategies]] hinges on:
*   **Continued Investment:** Doubling down on building data infrastructure and fostering partnerships with civil society and the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>.
*   **Building Trust:** Governments must trust civil society's ideas and demonstrate transparent, ethical handling of data, ensuring data protection while new technologies develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.
*   **Focus on Equity:** Ensuring that data-driven services address injustices and inequalities in society, making data work for all people, not just a few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.
*   **Human-Centric Approach:** Never forgetting the importance of the human touch; technology is a tool to bring people together, not to replace human elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
*   **Responsible Innovation:** Building participation into the design of data-driven public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>.

This period of rapid change, while challenging, has highlighted the potential for governments to accelerate [[public_sector_innovation_and_government_transformation | public sector innovation and government transformation]] and strengthen [[public_sector_resilience_and_transformation | public sector resilience and transformation]] by strategically leveraging data.

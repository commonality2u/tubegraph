The [[opsi_toolkit_navigator_development_and_design | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] is a resource created by the [[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | Observatory of Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) to help public servants navigate the vast landscape of innovation tools and methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. It aims to connect specific challenges or situations faced by public servants to the most relevant [[methods_and_tools_in_innovation_toolkits | innovation tools and methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## The Challenge for Public Servants

Public servants encounter diverse challenges, problems, and situations, none of which are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While [[methods_and_tools_in_innovation_toolkits | innovation tools or methods]] offer new approaches to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, the abundance of available resources poses a significant hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Hundreds of excellent innovation tools, toolkits, guides, and playbooks already exist, leading to difficulty in knowing where or how to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. What is truly needed is a better filter or a compass to guide users to the appropriate resources for their innovation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Purpose and Functionality

The [[opsi_toolkit_navigator_development_and_design | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] was developed to address this challenge by serving as a compass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It connects a user's specific situation, problem, or challenge to toolkits that can provide assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The navigator filters out unnecessary information, providing a clearer path for public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Development Process

The [[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] developed this resource in collaboration with hundreds of public servants and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The creation process involved several key steps:

1.  **Analysis and Organization**: Hundreds of existing toolkits were analyzed and organized based on the actions they inform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  **Situation Exploration**: The common situations, problems, and challenges faced by public servants were explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  **User Language Understanding**: Research was conducted to understand how public servants typically discuss and conceptualize their desired actions or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
4.  **Navigational Path Design**: Navigational path options were designed to connect these two aspects, allowing the [[opsi_toolkit_navigator_development_and_design | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] to suggest tools according to desired actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Beyond Tool Finding

Recognizing that innovation involves more than just finding the right tool at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, the [[opsi_toolkit_navigator_development_and_design | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] also connects users to additional valuable resources:

*   **Skills and Capacity Building**: Access to resources that help build relevant skills and capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Case Studies**: Real-life examples of innovation in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Community and Expertise**: Connections to fellow public servants and experts who have experience with similar challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

"Government Aftershock" was an event put on with the support of the European Commission through its Horizon 2020 program and technical sponsor Microsoft, to make sense of the complicated context presented by the Covid-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The event aimed to contribute to three core questions:
*   What needs to be left behind from this crisis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
*   What do we want to keep? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   What should we do differently? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

## The Emphasized Role of Government

The crisis has clearly emphasized the vital role of the state, with many seeing it as a "return of the state," similar to the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. It highlighted the need for strong public sector capabilities and capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The crisis has also shown that [[public_sector_adaptation_during_covid19 | government can work in different and more flexible ways]] with the private sector, other stakeholders, and the broader community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. While governments didn't have much choice in the matter, the crisis proved that things can be done very differently when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The question remains whether lessons can be learned to build a more flexible, anticipatory, and resilient state for future crises like climate change or unforeseen pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Speed and Societal Cooperation

Latvia's Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš highlighted speed of reaction as crucial during the first wave of Covid-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Latvia reacted very quickly, implementing restrictions before its first Covid-19 death, which helped to "get the curve down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
A second key lesson was getting society to work *with* government, not against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. During the first wave, explaining the danger and inviting cooperation led to extensive societal cooperation and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### Lessons from Latvia's Experience

The success of the first wave, however, led to difficulties in the second wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The economic impact of restrictions, including job and wage losses, caused stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. When the second wave approached, there was significant societal discussion about how quickly to react and how many restrictions to impose, leading to a slower reaction time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. While the first wave's decisions were made in about 10 days, the second wave took closer to three and a half weeks for government and society to align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This delay resulted in considerably more cases and climbing deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
Kariņš noted that in societies valuing freedom and democracy, there is a challenge in convincing people to adhere to restrictions that require giving up some openness to protect health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. The dialogue between government and society is crucial, as "no government can go faster than society is willing to follow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. For the "long haul" of the pandemic, preparing for a potential third wave requires continually informing society on self-protection and implementing safety measures during low epidemic periods to minimize future restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Key to cooperation is for heads of government to "inform, inform, inform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Economic and Fiscal Challenges

The crisis exacerbated underlying issues such as inequalities, economic insecurity, and uneven healthcare access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. The OECD projects a 4.5% fall in world GDP in 2020, which is "unbelievable" and will take years to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. Governments have taken extraordinary swift measures, spending trillions of dollars on income support, expanded sick leaves, and aid programs to support households and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
These "extraordinarily budgetary expenses" mean governments will suffer enormous budgetary deficits, but maintaining some economic activity is necessary to fund these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. The goal is to keep deficits moderate enough for recovery within two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

## [[Government innovation during COVID19 | Government Innovation]] and Digital Transformation

[[Innovative responses to Covid19 by governments | Governments' responses]] to Covid-19 were not only bold but also [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Examples include experimenting with better communication approaches, coordinating with communities during lockdowns, and massively shifting to remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Serbia's Digitalization Efforts

Serbia's Prime Minister Ana Brnabić stated that investing in digitization, e-government, digital education, and an innovation-driven economy paid off during the 2020 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. These reforms, initially aimed at making government more efficient and transparent and the economy more efficient, enabled Serbia to:
*   Continue providing services fully electronically to citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.
*   Not lose a single day of schooling in 2020 by quickly shifting to online education when physical schools closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.
*   Become more resilient economically, with the ICT sector reaching 6% of GDP and showing resilience during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   Keep the GDP decline to minus one percent (or even 0.7%) and reduce unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

Brnabić stressed that a key strength for governments is to "go digital" to innovate and move away from bureaucracy, providing services 24/7/365 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. She highlighted the potential of artificial intelligence to automate repetitive civil servant tasks, increasing productivity and efficiency, enabling 24-hour service delivery, and eliminating physical contact between government and citizens/businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>. This digital approach also helps fight corruption by increasing transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. As an example, Serbia's fully electronic construction permitting process made it one of the top 10 countries globally for speed and efficiency, leading to a visible increase in infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.
Additionally, going digital significantly contributes to environmental sustainability; Serbia's e-government efforts since June 2017 saved 15,000 trees, 65 million liters of water, and 5,700 megawatts of electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.

### Fighting Youth Unemployment

Serbia launched the "My First Salary" program to address youth unemployment, which was hovering around 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. Recognizing the challenge youth face in gaining initial work experience, the government decided to pay at least 50% of salaries for companies that provide first jobs to young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. The program is fully digital, end-to-end, with online applications and matchmaking utilizing artificial intelligence for transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>.

## Strengths and Weaknesses Revealed

The crisis highlighted the decisive role of governments and public institutions, underlining how a trusting relationship between people and their administration is pivotal for addressing societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. High trust leads to better compliance and better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Studies in 233 regions across 19 European countries showed that mobility for non-essential activities was significantly lower in high-trust regions than in low-trust regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. People's perception of government competence, integrity, openness, and fairness is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. OECD surveys in Finland and Korea indicated that reliability and responsiveness of service delivery significantly influence public trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Only 37% of people in OECD countries feel their voice is important in government decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

### Addressing Underlying Issues

The pandemic exacerbated existing issues such as inequalities, economic insecurity, and uneven access to healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. It also aggravated a crisis of trust and inserted fear into the social fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. There is a worry that the gap between rich and poor countries and societies will increase, as labor-intensive, investment-driven economies will suffer more compared to innovation-driven, knowledge-based ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>. The crisis also highlighted the importance of digital governance, the need for proper regulation for platform companies, and the fragility of communicating scientific evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Disinformation threatens policy efficacy, undermines trust, and amplifies fears, requiring governments to fight it by being more open and directly engaging with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Preparing for Future Crises

To prepare governments for the next crisis, the recovery from Covid-19 must be green, sustainable, and inclusive, prioritizing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. Going back to "normal" is not an option because the pre-crisis normal "was not good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. Decisions made today regarding technology and policy will affect the environment and inclusion for the next 30-40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. There is a need to focus on digital education and skills for the low-skilled to integrate into a more digital future economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>.

### The Global Nature of Challenges

The pandemic is the most global phenomenon faced, affecting every country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. Dealing with such global issues requires global, multilateral approaches, international cooperation, and collaboration, similar to trade, investment, climate change, and biodiversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. The challenges of vaccine production, distribution logistics, and public willingness to be vaccinated highlight the need for vaccines to be treated as a "public good" and made available based on needs worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>.

### Balancing Freedom and Public Health

The pandemic has enormously changed the perception and understanding of individual freedoms and civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. Measures like forced identification of social circles, mandatory mask-wearing, social distancing rules, and tracking applications raise complex questions about where personal freedom starts and stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. Governments must carefully navigate how to protect health while simultaneously safeguarding civil liberties and individual freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. Serbia initiated a large public debate involving humanities and social sciences experts to discuss how governments should behave in such circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>. This will likely emerge as a worldwide problem even post-pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.

The Government Aftershock high-level Forum convened a global dialogue on modern-day challenges, revealing insights into the evolving role and expectations of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The forum focused on [[global_trends_in_public_sector_innovation | global trends]] and case studies in [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This involved over 60 local conversations with 4,500 participants and 21 global sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Collaborative Efforts in [[Public sector innovation]]

Since 2016, the OECD Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation have partnered to surface key [[public_sector_innovation_trends | trends]] and case studies in [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This collaboration aims to inspire others to replicate successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated an adjustment in the approach to the innovation trend exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. A solid knowledge base was fortunate to be in place, compiled from 683 cases received from 91 countries through their 2020 call for innovation and research, plus 450 cases from their COVID-19 Innovative Response Tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Based on this data, five key [[public_sector_innovation_trends | trends]] in government innovation were identified and developed into reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. These reports are available at trends.oecd-opsi.org <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Featured Case Studies

#### The [[Public sector innovation | Ministry of Possibilities]] (UAE)
The [[Public sector innovation | Ministry of Possibilities]], a virtual ministry in the UAE, was launched in response to the UAE Centennial Plan Vision 2071, which aims to make the UAE the best nation globally by 2071 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. It addresses "wicked and impossibles" hindering progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This virtual ministry incubates solutions for systemic challenges, operating as time-bound departments focused on priority national portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. It utilizes design thinking and experimentation, bringing together federal, local, and private sector teams, along with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

The ministry's four mission pillars are:
*   Identify Impossibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>
*   Incubate virtual time-bound departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
*   Educate and train individuals in design and experimentation mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
*   Inspire other governments with the UAE methodology of possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>

Challenges encountered included initiating projects with unknown solutions, as government employees typically work towards clear goals in an environment of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Adapting to agile working methods with continuous iterations based on user feedback was also difficult for some team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Lessons learned include the importance of a common understanding of the "impossible," having a dedicated team with specific competencies, and patience in the face of resistance to new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The hope is for the [[Public sector innovation | Ministry of Possibilities]] to be a replicable model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. To create synergies and empower teams, it's crucial to bring stakeholders on board early, make them part of decision-making, and ensure the value and impact are clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>.

#### Hack the Crisis (Estonia)
Accelerate Estonia's "Hack the Crisis" initiative showcased rapid [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] during COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Estonia operates an extremely digital society with strong public-private cooperation, a model in place for over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. On March 12th, 2020, following an emergency declaration, an online hackathon was conceived and launched within hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.## [[Public sector innovation and global trends]]

#### Hack the Crisis (Estonia)

Accelerate Estonia's "Hack the Crisis" initiative showcased rapid [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] during COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Estonia operates an extremely digital society with strong public-private cooperation, a model in place for over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. On March 12th, 2020, following an emergency declaration, an online hackathon was conceived and launched within hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. The event gathered 1,000 participants and 30 teams, some of whose solutions, like a government chatbot and breathing ventilators, are still actively used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

A key learning was the need for government to have the capacity to absorb incoming innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. The Estonian event inspired nearly 70 similar events worldwide, including "EU vs. Virus Hack" and "The Global Hack," involving around 100,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. This led to new companies, improved public-private dialogue, and some company exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. A challenge was the high toll on mental health due to intense work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. The success highlighted the importance of "free radicals" within government who adopt innovations and strong existing connections with the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. It proved that government can be a facilitator of important projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

#### Barefoot College (India)

Barefoot College International, based in India, works with the world's poorest and most remote communities, founded on Gandhian principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. With programs in 93 countries across Latin America, Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and Pacific Island states, it addresses 14 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

Its flagship program trains illiterate and semi-literate women as solar engineers, known as Solar Mamas, to bring solar electricity to their villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. A co-curriculum called "ENRICH" focuses on soft skills like aspirations, confidence, financial/digital inclusion, Women's Health, microenterprise, civil society, human rights, and environmental sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. Trained women return to their communities to build, install, and maintain solar systems, with households paying into a village fund for salaries and parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

Benefits include:
*   Light for extended hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>
*   Ability to pump water, saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>
*   Improved education and health outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>
*   Empowerment of women and girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>
*   Environmental sustainability and livelihood development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>

The program recognizes that self-sufficiency and agency are key to developing rural communities, especially where grids won't reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. Women are viewed as catalysts due to their often untapped potential and marginalized status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. McKinsey's 2015 report indicated that achieving gender parity could increase world GDP by 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. Examples of government partnerships include Zanzibar incorporating Solar Mamas into energy policy, Madagascar partnering on a training center, and Fiji building a regional training center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. During COVID-19, Barefoot College pivoted microenterprise training to help communities meet new needs, reassessed supply chains, and ensured communities had food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.

#### Elements of AI (Finland/EU)

The "Elements of AI" initiative, an online course developed by the University of Helsinki and private company Reactor, aims to improve AI literacy among the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. The goal is to demystify AI, allowing the public to participate in discourse necessary for regulating digital technologies and directing AI use for societal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. It addresses the societal cost of AI mystification, where complex issues like political polarization involve more than just technological challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.

Launched over two years ago, the free online course has over half a million participants worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. It requires no coding or complex math, focusing on AI literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>. The initiative launched local campaigns in various European languages, with a goal to be available in every EU country and language by summer 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. The course boasts diverse participation, with 38% female users globally and a majority in Nordic countries, and users ranging from working professionals to those 80-90 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. A follow-up course, "Building AI," was launched to upskill people in AI and digital technologies, transforming them from consumers to contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. The initiative emphasizes that AI is for everyone and that understanding it leads to more educated opinions on its application and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.

## Leveraging Innovative Momentum Post-2020

The challenging year of 2020 underlined the importance of government, especially in partnership with others, and served as a catalyst for [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

Key areas to leverage this momentum include:
*   **Partnerships:** Continuing public-private-NGO social enterprise partnerships is absolutely key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Sustaining Drive:** The rapid pace of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] seen in 2020 (advancements that might have taken 5-10 years) must be continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.
*   **Focus on Urgent Needs:** Prioritizing areas hit by crisis, such as mental health issues, accessibility to physical and digital services, and education, which have been disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.
*   **Long-term Commitments:** Balancing urgent crisis response with long-term goals like turning economies greener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>.
*   **Trust in Science:** The crisis has fostered greater trust in science, which can be leveraged for other challenges like the climate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>.
*   **Embracing Change:** People have learned that change is possible and can be enacted quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>.
*   **Agile Government:** The pandemic accelerated existing strategies and demonstrated that "impossibles" could be made possible quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>. Some governments, like the UAE, proactively announced more agile and nimble government structures, including new ministries and roles focused on digital economy, AI, entrepreneurship, and government innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>.

Areas at risk of "dropping the ball" involve equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. Many positive innovations may not be evenly distributed, leading to an expansion of knowledge or skills gaps rather than shrinking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. Further innovations are needed to ensure equal benefits for all citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. There is also a risk that new "innovation labs" or "mission-based approaches" may still adhere to usual procedures, dissatisfying people; a true dedication to doing things differently is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

## Personal Reflections on Change

In light of the past year, individuals reflected on personal changes:
*   **Do more:** Continue and amplify current efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   **Be bold:** Have the courage to pursue unexpected or non-traditional paths, even at the risk of neglecting standard metrics, to achieve significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>.
*   **Stay nimble:** Continue being adaptive while remembering that not everything can be digitized; the human-centric aspect remains vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.
*   **Self-care:** Prioritize personal well-being and reflection to avoid burnout, as an "acceleration mode" cannot be sustained indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>.

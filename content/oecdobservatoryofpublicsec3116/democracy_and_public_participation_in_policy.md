Governments face an acute need to respond to emerging challenges such as climate change, migration, and other rapidly developing issues [00:00:45]. Complex systems and their inherent problems are becoming the norm, rather than the exception [00:01:07]. While governments have been adept at reacting quickly [00:01:42], a purely reactive approach to policymaking is increasingly proving inadequate [00:01:50]. The goal is to be proactive, anticipating and responding innovatively before issues fully emerge [00:02:02].

To achieve this, governments require the ability to test innovations on the ground and ensure that [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | citizens have a voice]] [00:02:39]. Partnering with [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | civil society]], businesses, and other stakeholders throughout policy cycles is crucial [00:02:42]. This approach is vital for strengthening trust and democracy within societies and governments [00:02:51], contributing to the [[public_participation_and_trust_in_urban_governance | strengthening of citizens' trust towards government]] [00:03:11]. Conversely, anticipatory innovation governance can also strengthen the trust of government towards its citizens [00:03:22].

## Finnish and Irish Approaches

Both Finland and Ireland are actively working on building anticipatory innovation governance models [00:04:23]. Finland, recognized as a global leader in this area, has implemented significant changes in its strategic planning system, including a move to a strategic government program system first seen in 2015 [00:17:03]. Other experiences, such as fostering an experimentation culture, leveraging digitalization, and adopting ecosystemic approaches, provide a foundation for this work [00:17:42].

Despite progress, Finland notes a lack of an inbuilt connection between intensive foresight work and actual political decision-making [01:18:48]. The country aims to build an anticipatory innovation system as a next step in strengthening its strategic policymaking [00:18:29]. A particular concern is how to motivate and engage political decision-makers in these discussions, especially when dealing with issues that have wide social contexts and consequences [02:02:28]. The goal is to move towards [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | co-creation]] and [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | co-design approaches]] in policymaking [02:22:55], ensuring the public administration fulfills its responsibility as the guardian of the democratic base [02:21:23].

Ireland is also at the early stages of systematically introducing strategic foresight into its policymaking processes [02:49:49]. Driven by recent crises (financial, COVID-19, climate), the Irish public service is considering how to be "fit for purpose" by 2030 and beyond, taking into account megatrends like climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth, and migration [02:53:50]. The aim is to interpret signals and adopt a longer-term perspective in policy decisions [02:57:27]. This involves developing strategic foresight systems and capacity, linking them into existing government structures, and building capacity across the public service through initiatives like strategic foresight literacy training, particularly at senior levels [03:11:03]. The overall objective is to ensure that foresight insights are picked up and acted upon through policy [03:11:30].

## Radical Experimentation and Cultural Change

Government experimentation involves trying out new things in a rigorous way and measuring their effectiveness [00:46:47]. Key barriers to this include:
*   **Access to expertise**: Departments need methodological and process expertise to run rigorous experiments and navigate government processes [00:49:45].
*   **Data**: The ability to measure success or failure relies on good, organized data [00:50:15].
*   **Openness to failure**: Governments must accept the possibility of failure, understanding that experimenting can actually reduce long-term risk by identifying what works and what doesn't [00:50:39].
*   **Timelines**: Experiments are most useful when results are available in advance, requiring an anticipatory approach rather than reactive responses to urgent ministerial demands [00:51:24].
*   **Breaking precedent**: It is harder to do new things in government where precedent is powerful, necessitating the creation of case studies and examples of success [00:51:54].

### Swedish Initiatives
In Sweden, the Comet Committee (for Technology Innovation and Ethics) continuously delivers policy proposals to the government, aiming to increase speed towards sustainability goals and ensure responsible innovation and technology development [00:54:58]. Their model for anticipatory governance has three parts:
1.  **Understanding**: Continuously understanding technological developments (e.g., algorithms in finance) and their policy implications. This requires knowledge building, training employees, and creating mechanisms for interaction between regulators and companies [00:57:30].
2.  **Testing**: Creating "regulatory greenhouses" where different actors (agencies, companies, civil servants, civil society) can jointly test new technologies, solutions, and regulations under real conditions [01:00:11]. This requires a government strategy for testing, developing methodologies, and creating incentives [01:01:17].
3.  **Changing**: Adopting a more agile and step-wise approach to regulation and policy change, moving from understanding to setting standards, agreements, and finally legislation [01:02:28].

This process emphasizes collaboration and capability building in the public sector [01:03:21] and is viewed as a long-term cultural journey spanning several decades [01:04:04].

### Basque Country and Norway: Linking Anticipation to Missions
The Basque Social Innovation Lab is connecting anticipatory governance frameworks to specific missions, such as accelerating a transition towards a more sustainable economy [01:06:03]. This involves combining traditional foresight with a portfolio approach that incorporates strong social and cultural initiatives, alongside expert analysis and data [01:07:36]. The goal is to build sense-making capabilities at different levels of action â€“ for public sector initiatives, community-driven actions, regulation, and small-scale startups [01:08:38]. This approach aims to generate infrastructure (social, political, public sector, private) that can produce more innovative responses to emerging problems, rather than merely predicting future events [01:09:52].

Norway is working on developing seamless public services around seven prioritized "life events" (e.g., starting a voluntary organization) [01:15:37]. This project involves both systemic innovation and [[digital_participation_and_inclusiveness | digital transformation]] [01:16:50]. The Norwegian Digitalization Agency supports these life events by providing foresight and anticipatory innovation methodologies [01:18:10]. They offer tools, methods, and run workshops to test and learn with the various life events [01:18:44]. Utilizing future scenarios helps align different stakeholders and makes it easier to agree upon common missions [01:21:34]. This cross-sectoral collaboration aims to build a common platform for understanding future user needs and prioritizing new service development, even when working across existing government silos [01:22:10]. The government has created an "innovation space" for experimentation, where new ways of working, cooperating, and steering are being tried out [01:24:50].

## Deep Reflections on the Future of Governance

Experts highlight the need for a fundamental shift in humanity's relationship with the world, moving away from a "preemptive, colonizing, superior position" [01:54:10]. This requires ending hierarchical, command-and-control governance systems that perpetuate historical patterns of oppression [01:55:57]. The challenge lies in encouraging a transition out of the current world system, which is seen as "living dead" but can become "good compost" for a new future [02:14:31].

The concept of "futures literacy" emphasizes that anticipation is fundamental to life and that humanity can become much better at its diverse forms [01:58:02]. A key challenge is the tendency of policymaking institutions to operate within a "comfort zone" and embrace a "risk mentality" that stifles innovation [02:16:52]. This often leads to simplifying complex challenges into calculable risks, despite human inability to effectively deal with probabilities [02:17:31].

For managing paradigm shifts, it's argued that while some aspects can be approached incrementally, there's also a need to empower individuals who naturally think "well beyond the normal confines of what is considered to be advanced thinking" [02:08:15]. These individuals should be protected from existing organizational resistance to allow their inspirations to surface [02:08:37]. Looking to sources like science fiction can also provide insights into distant future possibilities and discontinuous effects [02:09:28].

A critical consideration is the ethical responsibility of governance during transitions. While accepting the "end of things" is important, the proper function of governance is to manage these transitions to protect and care for future generations, especially given the existence of destructive capabilities like nuclear arsenals [02:24:37].

Key levers to jumpstart a community around strategic foresight and anticipatory innovation include:
*   **Permission and empowerment**: Give permission to and empower those directly dealing with problems to envision their own futures and define their own solutions [02:21:01].
*   [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | Collaboration]], [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | co-creation]], and [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | co-design]] [02:22:00].
*   **Humility**: Leaders must admit they don't have all the answers and be willing to explore solutions collaboratively with an open mind [02:22:13].

The future is not a report, and its inherent uncertainty requires humility [02:26:55]. However, governments must still act today, embracing anticipatory innovation governance to chart new courses and fulfill ambitious missions in complex and uncertain futures [02:29:05].

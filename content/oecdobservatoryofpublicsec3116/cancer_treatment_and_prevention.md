Cancer has become the leading cause of death in Western Europe, a problem expected to worsen as societies age [00:04:47]. The inherent complexity of cancer, involving numerous parties, necessitates a structured approach for collaboration [00:04:58]. A mission-oriented approach offers a way to address this challenge by providing directionality, fostering new ways of collaborating, overcoming silos, and allowing for bottom-up experimentation and strategic thinking [00:00:56].

## Why a Mission for Cancer?

The adoption of a more mission-oriented approach is crucial for addressing long-term challenges like cancer [00:00:56]. It allows diverse actors to set a common direction, create shared understanding, and foster commitment [00:06:08]. Without it, individual organizations might move in different directions, leading to sub-optimal outcomes, such as expensive [[personalized_medicine | precision cancer therapies]] without sustainable reimbursement models, or less accurate molecular diagnostics due to data sharing restrictions [00:05:34].

A mission approach is particularly effective in health areas like [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | cancer]] because the field already possesses technological maturity, promise for new scientific advancements, and sufficient governance structures for health innovation, social systems, and regulatory frameworks [00:06:59]. It provides the necessary push to unite these elements and make progress [00:07:29].

## Opportunities in [[personalized_medicine | Personalized Medicine]] and [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | Cancer Prevention]]

Significant opportunities for [[personalized_medicine | personalized medicine]] and [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | cancer prevention]] lie in areas where multi-sectoral knowledge, experience, and decision-making power can be combined [00:08:41]. A shared mission facilitates collaboration and co-ownership of actions, requiring all collaborators to take responsibility in their areas of expertise [00:08:56].

Key opportunities include:
*   **Prevention and Early Detection** Focusing on more [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | prevention]] and earlier detection, particularly for high-risk groups and never-smokers, could save numerous lives [00:09:34]. This requires collaboration beyond medical specialists and industry, involving fields like behavioral sociology and communication expertise [00:09:56].
*   **Overcoming Fragmentation** A primary aim of the mission is to circumvent fragmentation in research, healthcare, and education [00:10:21]. This shifts research focus towards improving outcomes for at-risk individuals and patients [00:10:44].
*   **Comprehensive Continuum of Care** The mission emphasizes covering the complete continuum of [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | prevention]] and therapy [00:11:00]. It recognizes the need for robust infrastructure, such as comprehensive cancer centers and their networks, to ensure equitable access for all patients and address inequalities [00:11:12].
*   **Implementation Research** [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | Prevention]] is currently underfunded, receiving about 7% of typical [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | cancer research]] budgets, despite research indicating its potential to reduce the [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | cancer]] problem by 40% [00:11:35]. This highlights the great importance of [[implementation_of_health_policies | implementation research]] in this area [00:11:53].
*   **Targeting Biology** The mission seeks to delve deeper into biological questions, expanding collaboration to analyze histogenetic groups and subgroups, which often differ significantly in their biological backgrounds [00:12:30]. Factors like tumor microenvironment and genomic instability are stressed for understanding primary and acquired resistance [00:13:05].
*   **Advanced Clinical Trials** The next generation of clinical trials will be more complex, requiring better ways to describe evidence-based medicine and bridge the gap between innovation and [[implementation_of_health_policies | implementation]] in healthcare systems [00:13:27].
*   **Patient Involvement** Patients should be actively involved in clinical trials, as well as in the shared governance of comprehensive cancer centers [00:14:47]. However, current gaps exist in areas like health-related quality of life, outcomes research, and health economics [00:14:09].

## Implementing Mission-Oriented Innovation: Key Ingredients

Achieving mission goals requires effective stakeholder engagement, robust public-private partnerships, and addressing critical challenges.

### Stakeholder Engagement
Success hinges on having the right, engaged people on board, fostering collaboration, trust, and a common vision [00:17:09]. This involves a broad mix of expertise from various levels and disciplines, including healthcare sector collaboration [00:17:25]. Crucially, [[role_of_patient_involvement_in_cancer_research | patient and relative involvement]] in all steps is vital, alongside consistent communication [00:17:48].

The engagement model can be seen as a "penta helix," involving academia, healthcare, patients, authorities, and industry [00:18:33]. While stakeholders are committed, changes in how they work together are necessary, as they are not always accustomed to inter-sectoral collaboration [00:19:09]. For instance, national precision medicine initiatives across Europe (over 34 exist) need to collaborate closely, especially for rare diseases or cancers, to ensure patients have access to technologies and therapies [00:19:51].

### Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)
Building large PPPs requires substantial hands-on experience [00:21:37]. Initiatives like the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) serve as examples, with significant budgets contributed by both the European Commission and industry in the form of in-kind contributions (people, not just money) [00:22:13]. These partnerships catalyze state-of-the-art oncology research and development, aiming to understand [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | cancer]] biology, advance [[personalized_medicine | personalized medicine]], improve disease management, and involve patients in therapeutic development [00:22:50].

Bringing hundreds of partners from various countries and sectors together requires:
*   Full agreement and buy-in on objectives [00:23:37].
*   A clear legal and intellectual property (IP) framework to prevent disputes and foster trust [00:23:47].
*   A clear work plan to define roles and track progress [00:24:45].
*   Professional alliance management, as the scale of these initiatives means researchers alone cannot manage them effectively [00:24:55].

Building trust is a crucial and challenging aspect [00:24:18]. For example, industry partners, though accustomed to working with academia, may not be used to collaborating with each other and sharing knowledge that borders on competitive product development [00:45:00]. Overcoming initial skepticism and fostering trust takes hard work and long-term engagement, ultimately proving that the payoff outweighs the risks [00:45:36].

### Addressing Challenges
Several challenges need to be addressed on the "to-do list":
*   **Unusual Partners** Collaboration may extend to seemingly unusual partners outside traditional healthcare, such as ministries of transport or education [00:25:52]. For instance, addressing patient access gaps due to lack of transport may require partnerships with transport authorities [00:26:11]. For [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | prevention]], cooperation with schools and efforts to raise health literacy are crucial [00:27:12].
*   **Data Management** Data quality, standards, access, and robust data protection and cyber security are extremely important [00:33:13]. Data should serve as a support tool, not a limitation [00:33:31].
*   **Patient-Reported Data** Utilizing patient-reported experience, outcomes, and incidents (PREs/PROs/PRIs) through platforms for online monitoring, information exchange, and remote monitoring between visits is essential [00:33:41].
*   **Integrating Genetics** Integrating genetic information into routine healthcare is a significant challenge, requiring new ways of working for doctors and increased awareness [00:34:38].
*   **Prioritization and Follow-up** When identifying risks (e.g., through genetic testing like BRCA), it's vital to have agreed-upon services and funding mechanisms in place to mitigate those risks and provide care for individuals identified [00:35:09].
*   **Administrative Systems** Respecting and adapting to existing administrative routines, annual budget cycles, and leadership within healthcare systems is necessary for effective implementation [00:38:35].
*   **Transparency and Learning** Transparency within the mission ensures all parties are aware of each other's activities, avoiding repetition and effectively using resources [00:42:36]. Lessons learned from the [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | cancer]] mission, such as addressing transport barriers, can also be valuable for other areas of healthcare, like chronic diseases [00:43:09].
*   **Professional Management** The complexity of multi-stakeholder initiatives requires professional management expertise, not just single experts [00:49:01].

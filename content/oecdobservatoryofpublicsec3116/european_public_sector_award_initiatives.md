The European Public Sector Award (EPSA) serves as a platform for discussing [[Public Sector Innovation]] and sharing good practices within public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Panel discussions, such as the one referenced, often rely on real-world case studies and projects submitted for the award to illustrate key aspects of innovation in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Role of EPSA in Sharing Innovation

The EPSA awards are highlighted as a very good means to share lessons learned, innovative solutions, and examples across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>. Projects presented in connection with the award often demonstrate efforts to overcome common challenges in public administration, such as bureaucracy and hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Featured Initiatives and Their Contributions

Several projects, some of which have been part of the European Public Sector Award process, exemplify key facets of [[Public Sector Innovation]]:

### LabX (Portugal)
LabX is an experimental project initiated in 2017 by the Portuguese government to foster [[Public Sector Innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. It aims to create an open and safe space for experimenting and promoting innovative solutions in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. LabX focuses on transforming the public sector by rooting strategic thinking, improving public services through experimentation, and fostering capacity building among public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Key objectives and achievements of LabX include:
*   **Creating a network of innovators** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Designing new public services** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Engaging citizens** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   Conducting 25 experimental projects, engaging over 10,000 citizens and 2,000 public servants across 160+ public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   Helping to integrate new projects into Simplex, Portugal's flagship program for administrative simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
*   Operating with strong political support and financing from the European Social Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:28">[01:26:28]</a>.

A notable policy measure supported by LabX is the "right to challenge," which allows public sector teams to ask the government to temporarily remove regulatory barriers to test new ways of doing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>. This fosters a culture of experimentation and encourages personal engagement in innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.

### Gov Buys Innovation (Belgium)
This Belgian federal government initiative, shortlisted for the EPSA awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>, addresses challenges in public procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. It aims to create an interactive marketplace for modern public procurement, allowing governments to test new solutions before full implementation and use limited budgets for experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

Key aspects of Gov Buys Innovation:
*   **Marketplace concept**: Connects public sector organizations with innovative companies to dialogue about challenges and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.
*   **Focus on real problems**: Starts with real problems or needs rather than just ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Support for companies**: Guides innovative companies through the tendering process and provides expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Encourages the public sector to reveal its challenges and companies to showcase their solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>.
*   **Learning from experiments**: Promotes testing solutions with limited budgets and learning from both successes and failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

The initiative highlights the importance of open dialogue and framing procurement as a problem to be solved rather than a solution to be delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.

### Partnership for Change (Slovenia)
This program from the Ministry of Public Administration in Slovenia focuses on employee exchange and transfer of good practices between the public and private sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. Started in 2015, it began with a challenge to open doors and understand how things are done in both sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>.

Key features of Partnership for Change:
*   **Voluntary five-day exchange program**: Allows employees to learn about project management, strategy preparation, or e-services implementation in different environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.
*   **Breaking stereotypes**: Aims to dismantle misconceptions about how work is done in public versus private sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.
*   **Fostering collaboration and trust**: By understanding each other's processes, networks grow, and collaboration becomes easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.
*   **Addressing real challenges**: Competitions gather challenges from NGOs, academia, and various sectors, leading to solutions like promoting e-invoices or designing e-taxes applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.

The program is seen as a "safe way of experimenting" due to its voluntary nature and interest-driven participation, naturally revealing paths for future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>. It has facilitated exchanges for over 300 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges in [[Public Sector Innovation]]

All three initiatives demonstrate strategies for overcoming common challenges in [[Public Sector Innovation]]:

*   **Mindset Shift**: Making people realize that innovation is everyone's responsibility is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. This involves stimulating spontaneous innovation through openness and interaction with external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.
*   **Organizational Culture**: Fostering a culture where experimentation, even with potential failure, is accepted and encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Providing support, training, and tools, and encouraging dialogue are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy and Hierarchy**: Implementing measures like Portugal's "right to challenge" allows for temporary suspension of regulations to test innovative approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.
*   **Silos**: Cooperation is highlighted as the "only vaccine known to mankind against silos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:47">[01:30:47]</a>. Initiatives like Partnership for Change actively build cross-sectoral networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Sustainability**: Ensuring the longevity of innovative initiatives requires political sponsorship, continuous investment in people (training, autonomy), and developing management models that embed innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:48">[01:25:48]</a>. Focusing innovation labs on real, sponsored challenges also helps avoid them becoming "self-serving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>.

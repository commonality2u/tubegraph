Personalized medicine for cancer aims to optimize prevention, diagnosis, and treatment by tailoring approaches to individual patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This requires a collaborative effort and a shift towards [[missionoriented_innovation_in_cancer_prevention_and_care | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Why Personalized Medicine?
In 2020, 2.7 million people in Europe were diagnosed with cancer, and 1.3 million lost their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Worldwide, the problem is even larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. A paradigm shift in healthcare is needed, moving towards [[precision_medicine_for_cancer | personalized medicine]] for more impactful and equitable access to diagnosis and treatment across Europe and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Healthcare is an adaptive complex system, where changes in one area can cause unpredictable ripples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Missions provide an approach to move such complex adaptive systems to a more desirable state without destroying existing functional parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Mission-Oriented Innovation Explained
A mission is a coordinated package of initiatives, including policy and regulatory actions, and collective efforts like platforms and networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. These are tailored to mobilize science, technology, and innovation to address societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>.

Key requirements for missions:
*   Ambitious and concrete goals within a defined timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.
*   Spanning multiple stages of the innovation cycle, from research to market launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   Crossing disciplines, sectors, and policy silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   Utilizing diverse support instruments, both supply and demand-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

## International Initiatives in Personalized Cancer Care

### 1. Vision Zero Cancer (Sweden)
Vision Zero Cancer is a vision-driven [[public_sector_adoption_of_mission_oriented_approaches | innovation milieu]] in Sweden, aiming for a global impact, where actors across society engage in strategic collaborations to combat cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.

*   **Challenges:** Maintaining stakeholder and public attention over 10 years, accommodating diverse interests, and ensuring common ownership of the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:58">[01:47:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:38">[01:48:38]</a>.

### 4. Dutch Health and Care Mission (Health Holland)
The Netherlands has a central mission for health and care, supported by four other missions covering elderly care, chronic diseases, and extramuralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:26">[01:56:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:33">[01:56:33]</a>. Health Holland acts as a coordinator, working with 97 partners who invest 1.1 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:52">[01:56:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:33">[01:57:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:36">[01:57:36]</a>.

**Co-creation and Field Labs:**
*   **New Paradigm:** The mission fosters a new paradigm of co-creation, involving citizens at local, regional, and national scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:20">[01:57:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:25">[01:57:25]</a>.
*   **Sharing Risks & Benefits:** Co-creation extends to sharing costs, risks, new governance structures, and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:34">[01:59:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:41">[01:59:41]</a>.
*   **Field Labs:** Implementation occurs through "field labs" which are primarily physical initiatives working at the local level where problems occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:46">[01:58:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:51">[02:07:51]</a>. These serve as incubation rooms for radical innovation and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:44">[02:01:44]</a>.
*   **Multi-Level Perspective:** The approach emphasizes connecting local initiatives (niche) with regional and national levels (regime) and global trends (landscape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>. This is done by people flying between layers to build trust and co-create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:38">[02:02:38]</a>.
*   **Example: Dementia Village:** An initiative like Don t Louise, a healthcare organization for people with dementia, shared its vision with the entire village, involving bakers, municipalities, tech entrepreneurs, and neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:33">[02:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:57">[02:03:57]</a>. This led to an open village where residents can freely walk around, enabled by community and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:37">[02:04:37]</a>.

**Challenges:**
*   **Building Trust:** Connecting national policymakers with local initiatives to bridge differences in language and tempo is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:37">[02:10:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Engagement:** Encouraging regional actors to continuously share their stories, even when frustrating, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:52">[02:14:52]</a>.

### 5. Camden Council's Food Mission (UK)
Camden Council, a local authority in London with over a quarter-million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:41">[02:16:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:50">[02:16:50]</a>, embarked on missions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted existing structural inequalities and disproportionate impacts, particularly in health and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:43">[02:17:43]</a>.

**Mission and Approach:**
*   **Mission Statement:** "Fighting effectively everyone is wealthy with nutritious affordable sustainable food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:34">[02:19:34]</a>. This addresses climate emergency, food poverty, and inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:46">[02:19:46]</a>.
*   **Growing a Movement:** Missions are seen as a vehicle to grow a community-driven movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:57">[02:19:57]</a>.
*   **Mission on a Page Framework:** Used to capture mission components, including layers, issues, problem systems, opportunity areas, tools/levers, and success metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:23">[02:21:23]</a>.

**Learnings & Challenges:**
*   **Operating in Uncertainty:** Missions require working in conditions of amplitude and uncertainty, where outcomes are not fully known, making communication difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>.
*   **Balancing Short-term and Long-term:** The need for immediate results (e.g., addressing food poverty now) conflicts with the long-term, systemic change approach of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>. Storytelling helps bridge this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>.
*   **Defining Roles:** Continuously defining the role of missions internally and externally, and how they relate to existing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability and Inclusivity:** The process demands listening, deliberation, openness to criticism, and allowing residents' voices to be heard for inclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:45">[02:23:45]</a>.
*   **Organizational Change:** Moving established organizations away from traditional, fragmented approaches requires convincing internal [[stakeholders_in_healthcare_innovation | stakeholders]] that missions are an enabler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:50">[02:23:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:03">[02:24:03]</a>.
*   **Enabling Infrastructure:** Creating infrastructure to empower and connect diverse actors, such as bottom-up funding for resident initiatives and new decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:21">[02:24:21]</a>.
*   **Language Matters:** Using inclusive and encouraging language is vital, as many people are unfamiliar with the concept of "missions" and may perceive it as another bureaucratic strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:20">[02:25:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:31">[02:25:31]</a>.
*   **Political Changes:** Political changes can impact the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:54">[02:13:54]</a>.

## Common Opportunities and Challenges in Mission-Oriented Innovation

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) in technology and innovation are collaborative efforts between government entities and private sector or academic organizations to foster advancements and deliver improved public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. These partnerships aim to leverage external expertise, accelerate the adoption of new technologies, and drive economic development.

## The Role of Public-Private Partnerships
PPPs are crucial for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] by enabling governments to keep pace with rapid technological change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. They facilitate the quick application of contemporary science, technology, digital opportunities, and data to achieve front-line results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The core idea behind these collaborations is that the expertise and solutions needed to solve complex public challenges often reside outside government organizations, dispersed globally across various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

Key objectives of these partnerships include:
* **Stimulating creativity and entrepreneurial behavior** to translate ideas into impactful tools, technology, and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
* **[[building_trust_in_publicprivate_partnerships | Building new trust]]** between diverse organizations and across sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
* **Bringing organizations together** to solve common problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
* **Accelerating the pace** of adoption of innovations from the private sector, academia, and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
* **Focusing on mission results** rather than bureaucratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

## Examples of Partnerships in Action

### Accelerated Capability Environment (ACE) - UK Home Office
The UK Home Office established the Accelerated Capability Environment (ACE) in 2017 to transform how the public sector engages with modern science, technology, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. ACE operates as a platform that fluidly connects hundreds of organizations, including Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and academic institutions (comprising 80% of partners), alongside public sector bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

ACE's operational model includes:
* **Agile way of working** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
* **Mission-led approach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
* **Enabling technologies** like secure cloud infrastructure for data and IP sharing, which helps build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
* **Business-like funding model** that relies on delivering value to public sector customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

This model has led to significant growth, with ACE delivering over 80 commissions for dozens of public sector organizations annually, generating substantial co-investments and cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Examples of ACE's impact include:
* Improving the UK government's pandemic response through enhanced data sensing and understanding of virus progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
* Bringing sectors together to develop online age assurance standards to protect children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
* Introducing new technologies to support victims of modern slavery and violence against women and girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

### National AI Supercomputing Platform - Serbia
The government of Serbia has established a National AI Supercomputing Platform to accelerate the development of artificial intelligence (AI) products, which typically require expensive and inaccessible computational infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. This platform, installed in December 2021 at the state data center, provides computational resources for free to all stakeholders in Serbia's AI ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

Key aspects and benefits of this initiative include:
* **Supporting startups:** The platform significantly reduces costs (potentially saving startups €10,000-€20,000 per project) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.
* **Collaboration:** It serves 24 institutions, including faculties, science and technology institutes, and 19 startup companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>.
* **Ecosystem development:** The government focuses on fostering the AI and GovTech ecosystem through initiatives like joining EuroHPC, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI), and the Digital Euro program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.
* **Training and support:** A dedicated team manages user accounts, installs necessary environments, and provides daily technical support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.

This platform exemplifies how government can act as a platform to create [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovations]] and catalyze economic development in the private sector by consolidating computing power, which could also help reduce carbon footprints from decentralized data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.

## Broader Context and Outlook
The OECD's Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) and the UAE's Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation have collaborated since 2016 to surface [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Their work highlights the rapid scaling of innovation from small pockets to more systemic and technologically advanced levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The findings are based on a global call for innovations, which gathered nearly 1,100 cases from 94 countries in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. These reports, including the 2023 Trends report, are launched at events like the World Government Summit, bringing together decision-makers and innovators from around the world to share and inspire the replication of successful innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

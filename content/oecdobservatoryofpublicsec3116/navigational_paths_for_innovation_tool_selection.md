Public servants frequently encounter diverse challenges and situations that require new approaches and ways of doing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While there is no shortage of innovation tools, toolkits, guides, and playbooks available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, the abundance can make it difficult to know where or how to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A "better filter" or "compass" is needed to guide individuals to the right resources for their [[innovation portfolio management | innovation journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## OPSI Toolkit Navigator

The OPSI Toolkit Navigator was created to address this challenge by connecting specific situations, problems, or challenges to relevant toolkits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It functions by filtering out clutter to provide a clearer path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Development Process

The development of the OPSI Toolkit Navigator involved hundreds of public servants and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The process focused on creating effective navigational paths:

1.  **Toolkit Analysis and Organization**: Hundreds of existing toolkits were analyzed and organized based on the specific actions they are designed to inform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  **Situation and Challenge Exploration**: Common situations, problems, and challenges faced by public servants were explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
3.  **Conceptualization of Problems**: Research was conducted into how public servants typically articulate their desired actions and conceptualize their situations or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Based on these insights, navigational path options were designed to connect user situations with appropriate tools, allowing the OPSI Toolkit Navigator to suggest resources according to desired actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Beyond Tool Selection

While finding the right tool is important, the OPSI Toolkit Navigator acknowledges that [[innovation portfolio management | innovation]] extends beyond this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Therefore, it also connects users to:

*   Skills and capacity-building resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Real-life case studies of [[innovation portfolio management | innovation]] in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Fellow public servants and experts who have experience with similar challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

These additional resources aim to further support the global [[innovation portfolio management | innovation]] community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

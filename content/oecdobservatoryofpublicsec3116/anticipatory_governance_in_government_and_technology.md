Anticipatory governance involves breaking down mental and physical silos within governments to address complex challenges that extend beyond traditional departmental boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The goal is to foster a more integrated [[Anticipatory innovation|anticipatory process]] throughout the government, enabling technology policy to interact effectively with other governance institutions, policy areas, missions, and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Pirat Tennerist, a Senior Project Manager at the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, leads work on [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance|anticipatory innovation governance]], focusing on practical implementation within governments to utilize the future in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Key Aspects and Practices

### Foresight and Anticipation
A robust [[Anticipatory innovation and foresight|foresight]] system is crucial for analyzing technology, as it is a major source of critical uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Foresight involves understanding systemic interconnections and interdependencies among different trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

**Singapore's Approach**:
Singapore has a well-established [[Anticipatory innovation governance framework|anticipatory governance framework]], with scenario planning since the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Its toolkit was diversified around 2008-2010 with the establishment of the Center for Strategic Futures, moving beyond scenarios to include methodologies like emerging strategic issues and causal layered analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This system incorporates science, technology, and innovation (STI) elements, analyzing how they interact with politics, society, and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This process occurs across the entire government, including central agencies, individual ministries, think tanks, and institutes of higher learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

Despite this, formal [[Anticipatory innovation and foresight|foresight]] is less common within the science, technology, and innovation (STI) ecosystem itself, often due to a focus on hindsight, experimentation, commercialization, or immediate policy incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. However, the National Research Foundation is increasingly integrating foresight by scanning and sense-making global trends to bridge research, commercialization, and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

### Citizen Participation
Engaging citizens in [[Anticipatory Innovation in the Public Sector|anticipatory innovation]] is crucial for breaking silos, as citizens think about the future and their problems rather than ministerial boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. It complements government policymaking by providing diverse perspectives and challenging government biases and assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

**Methods**:
*   **Citizen Juries**: These formats involve dedicating significant time (e.g., 3-4 days) to learning from experts across various fields (policy, science, social science) to equip citizens with necessary data and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:35">[01:20:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.
*   **Oblique Questions**: Instead of direct technical questions, asking about fears or hopes for the future can yield rich, implicit qualitative data on emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:32">[01:22:32]</a>.
*   **Inclusive Space**: Creating a facilitated space ensures diverse opinions are recorded, including minority stances, as they can highlight future directions, fears, or hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>. It's not about averaging out opinions but fostering a debate of underlying values for the future of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:17">[01:24:17]</a>.
*   **Singapore's "Emerging Stronger" Process**: A citizen engagement process initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic to discuss various issues and societal transformation, emphasizing digital dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>.

### Experimentation and Living Labs
[[Technology foresight and governance|Technology foresight and governance]] increasingly leverage experimental settings such as living labs, test beds, real-world laboratories, and sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. These are designated experimental spaces to test and advance transformative technologies under real-world conditions, ideally with public participation and often with reduced regulatory burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

The focus is shifting from merely testing technologies *in* societies to testing societies *around* new technologies, inviting reflection on the desired kind of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>. This includes critically assessing who designs these labs, on whose behalf, and the implications of temporary regulatory loopholes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. Living labs should serve as true tests where undesired outcomes can also be identified and reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.

### Co-creation
Co-creation involves bringing different innovation actors together for joint activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. While varied in form (e.g., public procurement of innovation, co-creation facilities, living labs), its efficacy lies in tailoring innovation to local needs and sensibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.

**Challenges and Considerations**:
*   **Diverse Interpretations**: Co-creation means different things to different actors, leading to varied roles and responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.
*   **Power Dynamics**: It can reconfigure power, raising questions about who gets to shape discussions about the future and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.
*   **Scalability**: Scaling co-creation efforts can lead to the loss of local specificity, which is often its core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.
*   **Sustainability**: Maintaining continuous co-creation conversations and communities is challenging due to reliance on project-based funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:34">[01:29:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:25">[01:30:25]</a>.

### Formal Processes and Institutional Structures
Governments can establish formal mechanisms for [[Anticipatory innovation and strategic foresight in public policy|anticipatory innovation and strategic foresight in public policy]]. The Netherlands, for instance, has the Rathenau Institute, founded 35 years ago after the example of the US Office of Technology Assessment, to provide a long-term view on the impact of science, technology, and innovation on society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. Their role includes identifying political questions arising from new developments and determining needed societal deliberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

A breakthrough in the Netherlands is the standing committee for the future of digital society in parliament, which can look further ahead (e.g., to 6G instead of 5G) and address issues like virtual reality or digital twins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. This committee supports other parliamentary committees by setting a longer-term agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. Finland also has over 20 years of experience with future committees in parliament handling [[technology_foresight_and_governance|technology assessment]] issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

Standards are increasingly recognized as a mechanism for upstream and [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance|anticipatory governance]]. Voluntary design standards are gaining prominence as a mode of global governance, acting as market-friendly tools with global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>. They embody values and, as "expert knowledge stored in the form of rules," should be subject to democratic inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. Concepts like "safe by design" and "ethics by design" are examples of how communities can build values into technology development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.

## Challenges for [[Anticipatory Innovation for Governments|Anticipatory innovation for governments]]

*   **Coleridge Dilemma**: Regulating emerging technology is challenging due to uncertainty. Early regulation risks being misguided or stifling innovation, while late regulation (after widespread adoption) makes changing course expensive and difficult, as technology becomes embedded in infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Government's Aversion to Qualitative Evidence**: Governments often prefer quantitative evidence for decision-making, making it difficult to explore topics based on qualitative exercises, which are common in early anticipation phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>.
*   **Innovation vs. Anticipation**: It can be easier to implement an innovation than to initiate a deliberative process of anticipation and foresight, as foresight often uncovers debatable and hard questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:52">[01:41:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:08">[01:42:08]</a>. This leads to solutions being adopted before comprehensive discussions about their implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:37">[01:42:37]</a>.
*   **Representing Future Generations**: It's difficult to rely on current citizens to fully defend the interests of future generations, especially given the unpredictable nature of how people will interact with future technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:05">[01:26:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:12">[01:26:12]</a>.
*   **"Blitz Scaling" and Solutionism**: The private sector's rapid "blitz scaling" of technologies can drown out other considerations, leading to "solutionism" where solutions are taken for granted without asking critical questions about desired societal outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.

## Public-Private Interface

While the public sector often leads in basic research, the private sector is a forerunner in implementing and scaling technology designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52">[01:31:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>. A key challenge for [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance|anticipatory governance]] is to ensure that the private sector incorporates ethical and societal considerations. Currently, there are often fewer regulatory requirements for private sector data usage compared to the public sector, leading to different ethical concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:23">[01:32:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:45">[01:32:45]</a>.

**Strategies for Engagement**:
*   **Defining Clear Challenges**: Governments can define clear public policy challenges to invite creative solutions from the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>. This provides boundaries for creativity while ensuring public policy significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:53">[01:37:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:05">[01:38:05]</a>.
*   **Inviting Private Sector Involvement**: Engage private sector actors in discussions about desired futures alongside government officials and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:10">[01:34:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:23">[01:34:23]</a>. This is challenging, especially for startups focused on survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:15">[01:35:15]</a>.
*   **Promoting Public Value**: Encourage private sector and startups to demonstrate how they contribute to public value as part of their business model and technology design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:18">[01:41:18]</a>. This includes promoting radical transdisciplinarity to integrate societal values into technology development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:57">[01:35:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:28">[01:36:28]</a>.
*   **Systematic Integration**: A significant goal is to find systematic ways for tech startups to consider social dimensions of scalability and [[Anticipatory innovation|anticipation]] from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:46">[01:39:46]</a>.

## OECD's Perspective

The OECD advocates for stronger connections between communities focused on governmental foresight and innovation and those focused on [[technology_foresight_and_governance|technology assessment]] in the STI community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>. Technology and governance co-evolve, with digital transformation deeply implicating politics, ethics, and social organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.

**Design Principles for Upstream Governance**:
The OECD, in collaboration with experts like Sebastian, has articulated design principles for upstream governance within the innovation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>:
1.  **Anticipation**: To address deep uncertainties from emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. This means anticipating plural possible futures to shape engagement with innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
2.  **Inclusion**: Ensuring diverse actors are involved in technology production and deliberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
3.  **Directionality**: Setting clear goals, akin to mission orientation, to guide innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.

These principles apply across all stages of technological development—upstream (basic research), midstream (applied), and downstream phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:18">[01:12:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>.

The OECD will host "Technology in and for Society: Innovating Well for Inclusive Transitions" in December to discuss people-centered technology, foresight, inclusive development, global cooperation, and engaging the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.

Anticipatory governance, particularly at the intersection of government and technology, is a dynamic and evolving field that requires continuous discussion, reflection, and cross-sector collaboration to navigate the complexities of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>.

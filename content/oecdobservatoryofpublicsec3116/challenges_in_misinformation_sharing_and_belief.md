The global challenge of misinformation is a critical issue that fundamentally reshapes how information is consumed and shared, impacting public life including health, education, financial markets, and political affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Addressing this complex challenge requires a deep understanding of human behavior and collaborative [[international_collaboration_on_misinformation | international collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## The Human Factor in Misinformation
The spread of misinformation heavily depends on individual behaviors and choices in consuming and sharing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. A failure to employ a [[behavioral_science_and_misinformation | behavioral lens]] poses a significant risk to the success of any solutions tackling misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Research suggests that people may share misinformation not only due to intentional malice but also partly because of **inattention to accuracy** when engaging with news online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. There is often a disconnect between sharing intentions and the knowledge of what is true or false, meaning some individuals might share fake news even if they don't believe it to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## Individual Differences in Misinformation Susceptibility
Individual differences in trust and information consumption significantly shape beliefs and the sharing of misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Exploratory data analysis, leveraging data from the Cosmo Canada survey, identified three main clusters of participants based on their trust in information sources, information consumption habits, and cognitive factors like conspiracy mentality and openness to evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>:

1.  **Non-trusting:** These individuals have low trust in all information sources, low openness to evidence, high conspiratorial thinking, and high psychological reactance. They constituted approximately 20% of the sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
2.  **High-trusting:** These people show high trust in all information sources, especially social media. They also exhibit low openness to evidence, medium-high conspiratorial thinking, and high psychological reactance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
3.  **Institution-trusting:** This group has high trust in institutional sources of information but low trust in social media. They also demonstrate high openness to evidence, low conspiratorial thinking, and low psychological reactance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

The study found that the "non-trusting" and "social media trusting" clusters exhibited significantly greater belief in and sharing of fake news compared to the "institution-trusting" cluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Interventions and Policy Implications
To address the [[challenges_in_addressing_misinformation_in_different_contexts | challenges in addressing misinformation]], a collaborative partnership between governments and international organizations, including the OECD, Canadian, and French governments, was formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This first-of-its-kind cross-border collaboration aimed to:
*   Better understand the complexities of why people share misinformation on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   Evaluate the impact of [[interventions_and_strategies_to_reduce_misinformation | behavioral interventions]] on choices to share fake news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   Co-develop best practices to inform [[policy_implications_for_tackling_misinformation | policy responses]] to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Tested Interventions:
Two scalable interventions were tested to boost attention before people engage with news online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>:

1.  **Accuracy Evaluation:** Respondents were shown a random news headline and asked to rate its accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
2.  **[[digital_media_literacy_tips | Digital Media Literacy Tips]]:** Respondents saw a brief list of media literacy tips (e.g., investigate the source, look at other reports, watch for unusual formatting) before seeing news headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

The experiment, conducted with almost 2,000 Canadians, found that both interventions were effective in reducing intentions to share fake news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The [[digital_media_literacy_tips | digital media literacy tips]] had the greatest impact, reducing intentions to share fake news by 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This effect was found to be similar across all identified clusters of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

### Key Policy Messages:
1.  **Don't ignore the human factor:** A comprehensive policy response to misinformation must include an expanded understanding of human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
2.  **Empower people:** Empowering users through effective and scalable solutions, such as [[digital_media_literacy_tips | digital media literacy tips]], can complement holistic policy strategies and mitigate the threat of fake news without regulating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
3.  **Find what works across borders:** Governments should conduct rigorous policy experiments in [[international_collaboration_on_misinformation | collaboration with other countries]] to generate sustainable responses to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

The findings highlight that while misinformation is a significant challenge, it is also a symptom of a larger problem: the erosion of trust in Western democracies, governments, and government institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>. A comprehensive approach involves not just addressing misinformation directly but also working collectively to rebuild this core component of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

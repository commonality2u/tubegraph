The session "Accounting for Innovation with CAF," held within a global conference on better regulation, innovation, and quality in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, explores the crucial connection between quality and [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The overarching objective is to design policies, regulations, and services that are inclusive, co-creative, transparent, accountable, and trustworthy, constantly adjusting to the needs of citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Quality and Innovation: An Interconnected Relationship

The relationship between quality and [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | innovation]] is often debated, with questions arising about which precedes the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. However, research indicates that both processes are essential and interconnected, and should not be treated separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. [[Public Sector Innovation in Response to COVID19 | Innovation]] can create a platform for organizations to improve and be ready to innovate, fostering a mindset that embraces change and utilizes collective knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) has proven to be a significant aid for organizations, preparing them for uncertainties through continuous learning and performance analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This holistic approach helps change the mindset of both the organization and its staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Turning Crisis into Opportunity

The [[Lessons learned from the COVID19 pandemic for future governance strategies | COVID-19 crisis]] presents an opportunity to convert threats into opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This requires organizations to become anticipatory, investing in agile systems and collaborative instruments to provide rapid responses to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. An ongoing analysis by the OECD, with support from the European Commission, is examining how CAF-using organizations performed during the pandemic to draw valuable [[lessons_learned_from_the_covid19_pandemic_for_future_governance_strategies | lessons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

CAF is more than a quality tool; it cultivates attributes that position [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | public sector]] organizations to overcome disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The 2021 Global Resilience Report by Deloitte identifies five characteristics of resilient and innovative organizations, all embedded within the CAF model and its principles of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>:
*   **Be prepared**: Organizations with clear short and long-term priorities, strategies, and planning outperform others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Be adaptable**: Utilizing an adaptable workforce with flexible teams is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Be collaborative**: Increasing collaboration both internally and externally is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Be trustworthy**: Building trust between leaders and employees, and fostering transparency internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Be responsible**: Responsibility that extends beyond the bottom line and can adapt in response to crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

CAF has emerged stronger after the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Organizations must interpret CAF criteria in context, as true [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | resilience]] is tested by adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Organizations that have pursued excellence with CAF or other quality tools have outperformed others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | Innovation]] and [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | resilience]] involve both thinking ahead and being well-prepared in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Case Study: Vienna City Administration

Vienna, a city of 1.9 million citizens, has a long history of using CAF, implemented by mutual agreement between political and administrative levels for almost 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. The city employs a range of management methods and models, including ISO 9001 and the EFQM excellence model, but CAF blends perfectly with these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

CAF acts as a coach for organizational and cultural development, particularly for a [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | public administration]] that works closely with citizens' needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | Innovation]] requires space and a basic perfection of organizational development to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. It needs a solid foundation and a connection to benefiting all players, not just the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

CAF fosters a new organizational culture where every individual makes a difference, combining abilities and motivation towards continuous improvement and [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This systematic improvement leads to a new mindset, increased awareness of strengths, and preparedness for looking for improvement options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This "fitness" goes hand in hand with agility and [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | resilience]], leading to a continuous cycle of development and [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

Working on small improvements can lead to major gains, as [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | innovation]] needs preparedness, planning, and consideration of impact and outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Citizens should be partners in the innovation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. The international CAF network facilitates mutual exchange of experience and learning, which in turn leads to [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

## Case Study: Krakow City Administration

Krakow City Office has used CAF since 2011, conducting four self-assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. The 2017 self-assessment specifically focused on improving communication with clients and internal communication, which became particularly important during the [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_sector_management | COVID-19 crisis]] when traditional channels were limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.

Key improvements in Krakow:
*   **Taxpayer Portal (2018)**: An electronic tool with an information platform on local taxes and fees, and a personalized channel for citizens to communicate with the office, check tax liabilities, submit declarations, and pay taxes online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. This significantly reduced phone inquiries and became a success, with thousands of new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Official Language (2019)**: Guidelines and training workshops were developed to help officials write and speak in a more understandable and inclusive language, balancing administrative rules with citizen comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>. This has led to improved customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.
*   **Parcel Lockers for City Services (2020)**: Inspired by the [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_sector_management | COVID-19 crisis]] and the rise of parcel locker use, this service allows citizens to receive physical documents (e.g., license plates) without direct contact or waiting in queues, offering 24/7 accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. This solution is expected to remain useful post-crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>.
*   **Integrated City Contact Center (2021/2022)**: Planned to launch in 2022, this center aims to consolidate information and answer questions about various city and municipal services in one place, addressing long telephone queues experienced during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

CAF acted as a "trigger" for these [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | innovations]], inspiring new ideas and projects by focusing the attention of both management and employees on client communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. Krakow's initial motivation for CAF implementation was financial, tied to European Union funding for new management and development tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. The positive results encouraged continued use, leading to four self-assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>.

## Leveraging Cooperation for Employee Satisfaction

The Ministry of Education, Science, and Sports in Slovenia identified through its first CAF self-assessment the need for an employee survey to understand satisfaction, organizational climate, and mission comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. This led to a voluntary collaboration with seven other public bodies to create a uniform methodology for an employee survey called "Employee Eyes," allowing for comparisons between organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.

The objectives of the survey were to:
*   Gain insight into organizational function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.
*   Obtain information for strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.
*   Develop a uniform methodology for comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   Prepare a customizable questionnaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.
*   Identify benefits and opportunities for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

The questionnaire incorporates modules on organizational climate, employee satisfaction, perception of change (Energy Vitality Survey), and total motivation (Total Motivation Survey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. These modules can operate as standalone units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. The group focused on including actionable items that could be implemented in an action plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. Sharing good and bad practices was crucial for risk identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>.

The most important phase is the survey result dissemination, which must be tailored for the management team and every employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. Following this, the implementation phase requires acting upon results, building a realistic action plan, and introducing changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. Reapplying the questionnaire helps assess the success of implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>.

Analysis of survey results using latent class analysis helps differentiate between satisfied and unsatisfied employees and identify key differentiating factors, such as participation in training and efficient work planning by heads of departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. Such insights are a strong management tool for strategic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. This project demonstrates the importance of the national network of CAF users for further model development and better results in [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | public organizations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.

## [[Lessons learned from the COVID19 pandemic for future governance strategies | Early Lessons from the COVID-19 Crisis]] for [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | Public Sector Resilience]]

The [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_sector_management | COVID-19 crisis]] forced public administrations to respond swiftly to its effects on economies, societies, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>:
*   **New Institutional Structures**: 77% of centers of government reported increased cross-ministerial coordination instances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
*   **Increased Spending**: Government expenditures rose as a share of GDP in 26 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.
*   **Emergency Regulations**: Regulatory impact assessment exceptions rose sharply to fast-track new regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   **New Health Protocols**: Measures were put in place to protect users and civil servants while maintaining productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.
*   **Digitalization and Teleworking**: Many organizations shifted to hybrid delivery and digitalized services rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>; over 60% of civil servants worked remotely in most OECD countries in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>.
*   **New Communication Channels**: Protocols were used to combat misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

[[Postpandemic institutional changes and future preparedness | Post-pandemic]], [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | public sector]] organizations must focus on multi-dimensional and complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>. Government priorities for recovery include restoring growth, protecting the vulnerable, building a green economy, debt sustainability, and employment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.

Four key priorities require different thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>:
1.  **Spending better for the future** given increased deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>.
2.  **Addressing global challenges and risks**, such as climate change, noting that 83% of recovery funds don't consider environmental dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.
3.  **Inclusiveness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>.
4.  **Trust**, with only slightly more than half of citizens trusting their governments in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>.

## Strengthening [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | Public Sector Resilience]] for the Future

To be fit for the future, public administrations need to strengthen their [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | resilience]] to future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. Initial [[lessons_learned_from_the_covid19_pandemic_for_future_governance_strategies | lessons]] highlight the importance of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>:
*   **Preparedness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
*   **Agility** (e.g., rapid shift to digital, large-scale remote working) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.
*   **Cultivating skills and capabilities** among public sector employees to solve complex problems and innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
*   **Developing foresight capacities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.
*   **Strengthening coordination, consultation, and communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.
*   **Embedding cross-cutting challenges** (environment, inclusiveness, digitalization, integrity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.

The CAF model can help organizations become more [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | resilient]] and fit for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>. It can assess preparedness and help organizations become more [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | resilient]] across various dimensions, identifying which innovations (e.g., parcel lockers) might persist [[Sustaining public sector transformation beyond crisis | post-crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

CAF's role in future [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | resilience]] includes assessing:
*   **Leadership**: Adaptability of managerial structures, coordination for complex challenges, and leadership skills for crisis situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>.
*   **Strategy and Planning**: Contingency plans, foresight capacities, teleworking policies, and skills for digital environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>.
*   **HR Policies**: Adapted human resources policies and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.
*   **Partnerships and Resources**: Strong partnerships supporting delivery and reaching users, and tools to combat disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>.
*   **Processes**: Improvements in procurement procedures, especially for essential goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

A project led by Belgium, involving 10 other countries (including Slovenia, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Finland, and Spain), aims to build on [[lessons_learned_from_the_covid19_pandemic_for_future_governance_strategies | lessons from the crisis]] to strengthen [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | public sector resilience]] in EU member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>. Its objectives are to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>:
1.  **Look back**: Take stock of how [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | public sector]] organizations managed the [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_sector_management | COVID-19 crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>.
2.  **Look forward**: Highlight and promote [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | innovations]] for more resilient [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | public sector]] organizations in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>.
3.  **Support the CAF network**: Strengthen the model's use and support new developments in the [[Postpandemic institutional changes and future preparedness | post-COVID-19 period]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

This project, which includes surveying CAF users, seeks to identify main challenges and draw [[lessons_learned_from_the_covid19_pandemic_for_future_governance_strategies | lessons]] to produce a synthesis report by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

### CAF and Strategic Foresight

The CAF model, revised in 2020, significantly emphasizes [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>. The word "innovation" is mentioned 50 times in the 2020 model, indicating a reinforcement from the previous 2013 version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. It is explicitly included in the principles of excellence, particularly Principle 6: "Continued Learning, [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | Innovation]] and Improvement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>. It is also mentioned in Criteria 2 on strategy and planning, especially Sub-criteria 2.4: "Manage Change and [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | Innovation]] in an Agile Way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. This demonstrates how CAF helps organizations become innovative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.

A recent study in Slovenia, supported by audience poll results, confirms a significant impact of CAF implementation on human resource management (the "people" criteria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. The [[lessons_learned_from_the_covid19_pandemic_for_future_governance_strategies | COVID-19 crisis]] highlighted weaknesses and areas for improvement in human resource management, emphasizing the need for a step-by-step approach to adapting to new working methods, such as hybrid and remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. For example, managing organizational knowledge has become different due to remote working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.

[[crossborder_government_innovation | Cross-border government innovation]] is a critical area in a continuously changing world, where complex issues necessitate governments looking beyond their national borders for solutions to global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While there are many existing [[examples_and_case_studies_of_innovation_across_borders | examples]] of this, from ending pandemics to managing migration and reducing carbon dependency, the best way to achieve cross-border collaboration is not yet clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. A key question is how governments can improve their ability to [[innovation_in_government | innovate]] together for the public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Drivers and Challenges

The COVID-19 crisis highlighted a lack of preparedness among governments to tackle global challenges, accelerating digital transformation and the pace of [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] while exposing pre-existing vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Issues like climate change, pandemics, and disruptions in global value chains necessitate global approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Although [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] has become a crucial tool for addressing these challenges, government [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] efforts often remain confined to national and local borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

A poll asking about the most important challenge or barrier to [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border government innovation]] revealed "undeveloped ecosystems" as the highest challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Other challenges include cultural norms, lack of feedback mechanisms and learning loops, and difficulties in scaling experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

Key success factors for [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border government innovation]] often mirror these challenges, including:
*   A culture of openness and [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.
*   Agility and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.
*   Understanding and engaging ecosystem players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.
*   Clearly defining roles and responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
*   Honing the role of cross-border facilitators or orchestrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

## Collaborative Initiatives and Research

The OECD Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed Bin Rashid Center for Government [[innovation_in_government | Innovation]] have partnered to study how governments can best support [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Their research includes a global call for [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] and global workshops on cross-border innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

A report titled "Achieving [[crossborder_government_innovation | Cross-Border Government Innovation]]" highlighted that complex and trans-boundary issues require existing [[governance_structures_for_crossborder_cooperation | governance mechanisms for international cooperation]] to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Governments are leveraging new [[governance_structures_for_crossborder_cooperation | governance structures]], such as innovative governance bodies, horizontal networks, and coordinated systems approaches, to tackle cross-border issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

The second report, "Surfacing Insights and Experimenting Across Borders," focuses on ground-up approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. It covers:
*   **Ground-up surfacing of insights and collective intelligence:** Applying existing approaches in new cross-border and global ways, such as challenge initiatives, crowdsourcing, and democratic citizens' assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
*   **Experimenting and testing across borders:** Developing new ideas and scaling them in a cross-border manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

## Ecosystems and Collaboration

Building robust ecosystems is vital for [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border government innovation]]. This involves understanding different types of ecosystemsâ€”horizontal (e.g., communities of practice around prize competitions or citizen science) and vertical (e.g., mission-focused coalitions like climate change entities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>.

Key elements for creating and scaling sustainable [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] ecosystems include:
*   **Legal and Policy Frameworks:** Actively working to change or adapt laws to enable [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.
*   **Shared Infrastructure and Common Platforms:** Providing platforms for easy access and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.
*   **Communities of Practice:** Supporting and connecting individuals who want to learn and share expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.
*   **Strategic Budgeting:** Budgeting for the success and scaling of pilots, not just for the pilot phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.
*   **Addressing Agency Processes:** Streamlining internal processes that can act as barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.
*   **Reporting Requirements and External Assessments:** Maintaining an evaluation mindset to learn from results, even when they are not positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

The London Office of Technology and [[innovation_in_government | Innovation]] (LOTI) exemplifies how a small, focused team can significantly impact collaboration within an ecosystem, such as London's 32 boroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. They focus on common methodologies and ethical foundations for responsible [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. This approach highlights that the future of [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] will be driven more by collaboration and effective methodology than by specific technologies like AI or 5G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.

## The Role of Culture

Culture plays an extremely important role in the development of [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] ecosystems and [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>. A conscious decision to work with authorities that subscribe to a certain set of principles, like agile methodology, can create momentum and a "fear of missing out" for others to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This fosters a cultural "bar" that, once met, allows groups to work together and gain mutual benefits, including motivational ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>.

## Future Outlook

[[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | Cross-border collaboration]] is expected to increase because many of the largest global challenges, such as net-zero emissions, education, health, poverty, and inequality, are inherently cross-border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>. These problems cannot be solved within national boundaries alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:32">[01:25:32]</a>.

The future will likely see:
*   **Increased institutionalization:** Moving beyond one-off projects to establish stable roles, structures, and funding streams for [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.
*   **Mini-lateralism:** A growing number of collaborations among groups of countries around specific tasks, which are more agile than large multilateral bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
*   **Systematic use of collective intelligence:** Leveraging the internet, web, and data to organize and harness knowledge from diverse sources, making it a common practice in government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.
*   **Focus on foundational discussions:** Continued emphasis on shared standards, data usage, and methodologies for designing and convening innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>.

Organizations like the OECD aim to reduce the frictions and transaction costs associated with [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] to facilitate its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

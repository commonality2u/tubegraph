In a continuously changing world, governments are increasingly looking beyond their borders to develop solutions to complex global challenges, ranging from ending pandemics to managing migration and reducing carbon dependency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While many examples exist, it is not yet clear how [[government collaboration across borders | cross-border collaboration]] can be best achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The key question is how governments can improve at [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | innovating together]] for the public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Need for Crossborder Innovation

The COVID-19 crisis accelerated digital transformation and the pace of [[Public sector innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It also exposed pre-existing vulnerabilities at the national level, highlighting a lack of preparedness among governments to tackle global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and disruptions in global value chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Public sector innovation has become a key tool to collectively address today's most pressing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. However, government innovation efforts are largely confined to national and local borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Research and Collaboration Efforts

The OECD Observatory of [[innovation in the public sector | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed Bin Rashid Centre for Government Innovation have partnered to determine how innovative practices can best support [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_sector_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Their joint work includes extensive research, a global call for innovation to collect insights, and open global workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The first report in their series, "Achieving Cross-Border Government Innovation," highlighted that issues facing governments are increasingly complex and transnational, requiring existing international cooperation mechanisms to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Governments are leveraging new governance structures, including innovative governance bodies, horizontal networks, and coordinated systems approaches, to tackle cross-border issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

The second report, "Surfacing Insights and Experimenting Across Borders," focuses on experimentation as a key mode of innovation in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This report details how governments are applying similar approaches in [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | cross-border]] and global contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Key Challenges and Success Factors

A survey posed the question: "What is the most important challenge or barrier to [[Crossborder government innovation | cross-border government innovation]]?" The top answer was "undeveloped ecosystems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

### Challenges:
*   **Cultural norms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>
*   **Lack of feedback mechanisms and learning loops** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>
*   **Undeveloped ecosystems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>
*   **Scalability of experiments** (especially in the design process) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>
*   **Understanding the cost and benefits** of different partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>

*   **Clearly defining roles and responsibilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>
*   **Honing the role of cross-border facilitators or orchestrators** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>

## Approaches and Case Studies

### Surfacing Insights and Collective Intelligence
This involves taking existing approaches and applying them in new cross-border and global ways, such as challenge initiatives, crowdsourcing, and democratic citizens' assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

*   **Deep Space Food Challenge**: An international collaboration between the Canadian Space Agency and NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. It incentivizes innovation in food production technologies to meet the needs of space exploration and address terrestrial issues like food insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   NASA's approach involves running parallel prize competitions with distinct rules and eligibility due to legal and policy restrictions on financial awards, but synchronizing marketing and outreach efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.
    *   The International Space Apps Challenge, celebrating its 10-year anniversary, is a horizontally focused ecosystem-building activity where NASA shares data and software for innovators globally to solve challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. In one year, 28,000 people from 162 countries participated in a 48-hour hackathon, generating nearly 3,000 projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>.
*   **Global Innovation Collaborative**: A network and platform for collaborations where city governments (e.g., Paris, London, New York, Berlin) launch open innovation competitions and invite innovators to deploy solutions in local testbeds, leading to more resilient and sustainable cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   London's approach involves "fixing the plumbing" by creating a strong foundation for engagement, like the London Office of Technology and Innovation (LOTI), which brings together London's 32 boroughs to work on projects using design thinking and data expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>. This has created a "fear of missing out" (FOMO) dynamic, encouraging more participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.

### Experimenting and Testing Across Borders
This involves testing new ideas and finding different ways to scale them in a cross-border manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

*   **5G Corridors (5G MOBIX) Case Studies**: Spanning the EU, China, and Turkey, this project comes up with experimental ways to test automated vehicles in different environments and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **Government Accelerators (UAE)**: A methodology that takes innovative ideas from experimentation to accelerated implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. Projects typically run for 100 days or less, empowering frontline employees from relevant entities and focusing on stakeholder building and collaborative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. The end of the 100-day journey focuses on setting a sustainability team to scale the proven solutions to different areas or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.
    *   The UAE's Government Exchange Program is a continuation of the country's principle of international collaboration and assistance, sharing knowledge and testing their tools like the government accelerator methodology in different types of governments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.
    *   The Moonshot Apprenticeship Program was launched in June 2021 by the UAE government to unite young minds, talents, and governments to tackle pressing global challenges, pairing UAE nationals with international counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>.
    *   The Moonshot Pilot Grant is a call for the international community to test groundbreaking ideas in partnership with the UAE, with funding potentially reaching up to $100,000 per project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.

## Recommendations for Governments
The report suggests five high-level recommendations for advancing [[Innovation Strategies for Governments | innovation strategies for governments]]:
1.  **Encourage and develop capacities for facilitator/orchestrator roles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.
2.  **Map and engage ecosystem players** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.
3.  **Implement iteration and learning** by building in learning groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.
4.  **Adopt scalable design** from the early stages of a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
5.  **Develop formal mechanisms** like sandboxes and testbeds to facilitate innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

### Practical Implementation
A playbook will be developed in early 2022 to provide more practical and hands-on guidance for governments to implement these recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

Jen Gusto of NASA highlights eight key elements to address for sustainable innovation ecosystems:
1.  Legal and policy frameworks (which can be changed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>
2.  Shared infrastructure and common platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>
3.  Emergence and sustainability of communities of practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>
4.  Budgeting for success, not just piloting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>
5.  Addressing agency processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>
6.  Reporting requirements for accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>
7.  External assessments and impact studies with an evaluation mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>

## Future Outlook for Crossborder Collaboration
There is a growing need for [[challenges_and_success_factors_in_crossborder_governance | cross-border collaboration]] as many of today's largest challenges are inherently cross-border, and cannot be achieved within existing national boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:13">[01:15:13]</a>. This will require developing strong partnerships, trust, and open collaborative relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:49">[01:25:49]</a>.

Jeff Mulgan suggests that the next step is to institutionalize innovation efforts, making them larger and more linked to policymakers and procurement priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. This means creating new ways of institutionalizing collaborative science so that efforts don't have to be reinvented from scratch each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>.

Abdullah Al-Jarwan sees cross-border collaboration strengthening over time, especially due to growing regional challenges like scarcity of resources, carbon neutrality, food security, water security, and unemployment rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a>.

Theo Blackwell emphasizes that future collaboration will focus on two main areas:
1.  **Climate change**, particularly [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaboration between public and private sectors]], driven by a unity of leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:22">[01:28:22]</a>.
2.  **Foundational discussions** around standards, data usage, and shared methodologies for designing and convening innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>. Sharing these foundations, supported by new institutions, will have a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>.

The concept of "mini-lateralism" is emerging, where groups of countries collaborate around specific tasks, differing from traditional multilateral organizations which often struggle with legitimacy or capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:39">[01:35:39]</a>. This field of innovation is bound to be an important space for mini-lateralism, and efforts to reduce friction and transaction costs will be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>.

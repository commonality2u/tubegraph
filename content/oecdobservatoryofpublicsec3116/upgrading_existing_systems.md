## Understanding Enhancement-Oriented Innovation

Enhancement-oriented innovation is a common practice in [[public_sector_and_technology_integration | government]] when undertaking innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It focuses on upgrading what already exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> by enhancing current practices and systems that the [[public_sector_and_technology_integration | government]] currently has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Practical Applications

Typical examples of enhancement-oriented innovation include:
*   Making [[improving_taxation_systems | taxation systems]] work better, faster, or quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Using behavioural insights to encourage citizens to pay taxes faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   Getting citizens to respond to queries in a more informed manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Characteristics and Risk

Enhancement-oriented innovation is characterized by relatively low risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These innovations do not necessitate a [[system_thinking_and_transformative_change | transformation of systems]] themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Instead, they are [[implementing_innovative_ideas | implemented]] within existing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, and the risks associated with their [[implementing_innovative_ideas | implementation]] can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

The goal is either to direct innovation towards making a specific type of system better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, or to exploit existing ideas to enhance current processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

[[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] is a crucial facet of public sector innovation, yet it tends to be systematically under-invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) is actively working to build this capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## What is [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]]?
[[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] is part of a multi-faceted innovation model used by OPSI to guide the purpose of different types of innovation in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It involves not just anticipating and innovating, but also establishing mechanisms and structures within governments to ensure this work can happen sustainably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This concept is closely tied to [[anticipatory_innovation_governance_framework | anticipatory innovation governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

The OPSI conducts its work through cases and action research, partnering with governments to build up [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] capabilities and learn what it takes to implement this work effectively in practice, moving beyond mere theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. A key part of this involves discussing the practical steps required to get started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Key [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation | Challenges in Implementing Innovation]]
Implementing [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] and [[anticipatory_innovation_and_foresight | strategic foresight]] in government faces several barriers, which OPSI categorizes into five broad areas that contribute to an "impact gap," where excellent foresight work fails to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>:

*   **Competency Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>: [[anticipatory_innovation_and_foresight | Strategic foresight]] practice is not universally seen across governments; it often exists in pockets of excellence but isn't systematically embedded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Cultural Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>: These include unreasonable expectations that foresight will reveal the future like an oracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Experts provide the best available knowledge, but it's imperfect as the future is always under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>: Humans are good at pattern recognition and forecasts, but many struggle with complexity, uncertainty, and exponentiality, leading to avoidance of uncertainty, groupthink, recency/availability bias, and a lack of imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
*   **Corporate Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>: Organizations often hold implicit "zombie futures"â€”official versions of the future that linger too long and become out of step with changing realities, hindering adaptation to disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.
*   **Communication Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>: Different perceptions of the future within an organization, if left implicit, can lead to surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. While diversity of thought is valuable, constructive disagreement and shared narratives are crucial for effective implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

From the user perspective, key challenges include:
*   **Uneasiness with Future Uncertainty** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>: People are uncomfortable dealing with uncertainty, often avoiding thinking about it or trying to repress it through prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Sense of Urgency (Day-to-Day Focus)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>: Public managers are constantly dealing with immediate issues, making it difficult to grasp the future horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Past Routines** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>: This perpetuates solutions that may no longer be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Helplessness and Isolation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>: Managers may have heard of foresight or tried to encompass new trends but feel alone in putting it into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Feeble Interest and Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>: There's a need to raise awareness and make foresight accessible to generate demand among practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Additionally, a significant challenge is the connection between civil servants and politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. Politicians need to be engaged in future discussions because they represent desires for a future society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. Political cycles are short (3-5 years), while the problems faced often have much longer time scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

## Strategies for Getting Started and Addressing Challenges

### Building Capacity and Practicality
Governments like Chile and Slovenia are actively working to build [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] capacity:
*   **Chile's New Ministry of Science** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>: Established to articulate actors and find local answers to global challenges related to the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. The national policy in science, technology, and innovation has a central area focused on [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   **Slovenia's Age and Talent Management Study** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>: Addresses demographic changes and the need for an efficient talent management system, using an [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory approach]] to look into the future and explore different options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. This is a bottom-up approach focusing on concrete cases to prove new methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.

### The [[toolkit_for_anticipatory_innovation | Toolkit for Anticipatory Innovation]] Approach
The OECD and partners are developing an [[toolkit_for_anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This [[toolkit_for_anticipatory_innovation | toolkit]] aims to provide a practical approach to [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]], translating concepts into actions that address real needs in public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

Key design principles for the [[toolkit_for_anticipatory_innovation | toolkit]] include:
*   **Problem-solving Focus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>: Based on solving real problems, translating them into challenges, and providing tools to tackle them without creating new dependencies, instead building internal capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **User-Friendly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>: Designed for public managers and civil servants who are beginners in foresight, supporting a "do-it-yourself" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.
*   **Actionable and Adaptable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>: It should not be a prescriptive solution but a modular one that can be recontextualized and adapted to different needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. It must produce real change and bring value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Problem-Challenge-Tool Structure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>: Users identify problems, translate them into challenges (e.g., imagining alternative futures, envisioning a new vision, setting strategy, understanding drivers of change), and then use corresponding tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>.

The [[toolkit_for_anticipatory_innovation | toolkit]] is intended to be immediately accessible and to socialize somatic skills like imagination, boldness, and prospection, which are critical for the future of public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.

### Limitations of a Toolkit
While valuable, an [[toolkit_for_anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation starter kit]] is not a panacea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. Its benefits depend on its construction and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>. Limitations include:
*   **Not a Solution Provider** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>: The [[toolkit_for_anticipatory_innovation | toolkit]] is a platform for asking questions, not for providing immediate answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>.
*   **Starts a Process, Doesn't End It** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>: It aims to start a learning-by-doing process and build capacity, which requires sustained effort over long periods to bear fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>. Breakthrough moments are unlikely in a single exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.
*   **Incomplete Picture** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>: While it enlarges understanding, it cannot complete the picture of potentially relevant considerations for decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
*   **Need for Action** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>: [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipation]] and [[anticipatory_innovation_and_foresight | strategic foresight]] do not solve problems on their own; they must lead to action and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. Excessive pondering without purpose-driven sense-making or concrete innovation is unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.

### [[incorporating_values_in_anticipatory_innovation | Incorporating Values in Anticipatory Innovation]]
Innovation inherently affects public values, and with [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipation]], this involves high uncertainty in shaping the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. A key question is how to explicitly incorporate values into the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>.
*   **Agreeing on Spectrum of Scenarios** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>: Public servants need to agree on a spectrum of possible future scenarios, acknowledging what is considered an opportunity versus a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>.
*   **Political Role in Values** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>: Politicians are crucial for agreeing as a society on how to respond to these scenarios, as this involves very personal questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.
*   **Open Access to Scenarios** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>: One strategy is to offer future scenarios as a public good, similar to open-source code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This allows politicians, the productive sector, and academia to interpret and respond based on their own values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
*   **Challenging Linear Thinking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>: There's a challenge to introduce less linear thinking to counter the dominant linear, economically-driven approaches to the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>.
*   **Stubbornness and Demonstrating Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>: Civil servants must be motivated and persistent in implementing solutions to prove the value of new approaches and gain leadership buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>. Communicating results and being stubborn in showing what works is key to spreading belief in this new culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

Ultimately, [[anticipatory_innovation_and_engaging_with_the_future | engaging with the future]] requires generating excitement around anticipation, securing senior buy-in and funding, and continuously asking questions, which relates to establishing an [[anticipatory_innovation_governance_framework | authorizing environment and agency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>.

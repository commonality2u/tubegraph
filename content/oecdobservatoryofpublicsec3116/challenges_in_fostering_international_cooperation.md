In a world undergoing continuous change, complex issues have become the norm, compelling governments to look beyond their national borders to develop solutions to global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Examples range from ending pandemics and managing migration to reducing economic carbon dependency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Despite the clear need for such collaboration, the optimal methods for achieving cross-border innovation are not yet clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The [[impact_of_covid19_on_international_cooperation | COVID-19 crisis]], while accelerating digital transformation and innovation, also exposed pre-existing vulnerabilities and a lack of preparedness among governments to tackle global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Issues governments face are increasingly complex and transnational, demanding that existing governance mechanisms for [[challenges_and_solutions_in_global_governance | international cooperation]] adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Despite this, government innovation efforts largely remain confined to national and local borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The question remains: how can governments improve their collaborative innovation for the public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>?

## Key Barriers to Cross-Border Innovation

A poll highlighted several significant barriers to [[challenges_and_success_factors_in_crossborder_governance | cross-border government innovation]]:

*   **Undeveloped Ecosystems** The most important challenge identified was undeveloped ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. Innovation can often feel like a "handmade in combat" process, where project managers must negotiate with various internal departments (e.g., attorneys, public affairs, IT) without adequate support structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
*   **Cultural Norms** Cultural differences present a key challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>, creating friction when not everyone shares the same perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>.
*   **Lack of Feedback Mechanisms and Learning Loops** The absence of effective feedback mechanisms and learning loops impedes progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
*   **Understanding Costs and Benefits** Clearly understanding the costs and benefits associated with different prosperous partners is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.
*   **Scalability** Considering the scalability of projects, particularly during the design phase, is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

### Underlying Issues

*   **Lack of Institutionalization** Unlike scientific fields where global collaboration, shared data, experimental results, and multi-country teams are normal practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>, government innovation often lacks established disciplines, journals, and funding norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. This means that each cross-border project is often undertaken as a one-off, facing high barriers and transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Absence of Stable Roles and Funding** Few governments have stable roles, structures, or funding streams for innovation, even within their own countries, let alone for [[building_skills_for_government_collaboration_beyond_national_borders | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
*   **Passive Engagement with Ecosystems** Merely championing open data or publishing information without actively engaging with users and stakeholders can lead to a disconnect, where the "ecosystem" of users is lost or unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>. Active curation and investment in teams are needed to fully leverage these ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:44]</a>.
*   **"Handmade in Combat" Approach** Without established support structures and ecosystems, each new innovative project requires project managers to repeatedly negotiate with various internal departments (e.g., legal, public affairs, IT), making innovation feel like a continuous battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

## Strategies to Overcome Challenges

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation have partnered to identify innovative practices that support [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Their research highlights that overcoming these challenges involves:

*   **Establishing Governance Structures:** Leveraging new governance structures like innovative governance bodies, horizontal networks, and coordinated systems approaches to tackle trans-border issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Embracing Experimentation:** Experimentation is emerging as a key mode of government innovation, gradually transforming ideas into realistic solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:05:08]</a>. The success of domestic experimentation encourages applying similar approaches in cross-border and global contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Budgeting for Success:** When piloting, budgeting should assume success, ensuring resources are available for scaling up without delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:41:04]</a>.
*   **Developing Parallel Competitions:** For [[international_collaboration_in_crisis_management | international collaboration]] with legal or policy restrictions, running parallel competitions with synchronized marketing and outreach can foster collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:23]</a>.

### Successful Approaches and Examples

*   **[[privatepublic_partnerships_in_addressing_global_challenges | Deep Space Food Challenge]]**: An international collaboration between the Canadian Space Agency and NASA to incentivize food production technologies for space exploration with terrestrial benefits like reducing food insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Global Innovation Collaborative**: A network and platform for city governments worldwide to launch open innovation competitions and deploy solutions in local testbeds, leading to more resilient and sustainable cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Government Accelerators (UAE)**: A methodology that supports strategic agendas, resolving challenges through pilot phases within 100 days by empowering frontline employees and fostering collaborative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:13:57]</a>. The focus is on sustaining and scaling these solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:36]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Possibilities (UAE)**: A virtual ministry designed to disrupt, ask difficult questions, and incubate solutions to systemic impossibilities, fostering collaboration across federal, local, private, academic, and individual stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:18:17]</a>.
*   **Moonshot Apprenticeship Program (UAE)**: Launched in June 2021, uniting young minds, talents, and governments to tackle pressing challenges under priority sectors like data economy and global talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:19:14]</a>.
*   **Moonshot Pilot Grant (UAE)**: A call for the international community to test groundbreaking ideas in partnership with the UAE, offering funding up to $100,000 per project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:47]</a>.
*   **Agile Nations Network**: The UAE joined six other nations to foster global cooperation on rulemaking in response to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48">[01:20:58]</a>.

Moving forward, the field of [[challenges_in_coordinating_stakeholders_in_mission_oriented_policies | cross-border collaboration]] is expected to increase, driven by the inherently cross-border nature of many global challenges that cannot be addressed within national boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:40]</a>. This requires developing strong partnerships, trust, and open collaborative relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:47">[01:25:52]</a>.

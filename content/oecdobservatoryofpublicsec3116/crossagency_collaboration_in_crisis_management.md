The recent global crisis has highlighted the critical role of [[intergovernmental_and_crosssectoral_collaboration | collaboration]] and coordination across public services, revealing significant lessons for the future of public employment and [[crisis_management_and_future_preparedness | future preparedness]].

## Lessons Learned from Crisis Response

Public administrations have demonstrated remarkable agility and responsiveness during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:01">[05:25:01]</a>. In Slovenia, the civil service's reputation significantly increased due to its ability to quickly provide anti-corona law packages and ensure the functioning of critical infrastructure and economic support measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. This period also shattered stereotypes of public service being rigid and slow to adapt, with roughly 70% of Slovenian civil servants shifting to remote work almost overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

In Australia, dealing with both extensive bushfires and the pandemic in 2020 put the critical role of the public service in sharp focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. A key lesson was that the public service works better when operating as "one APS" (Australian Public Service), rallying and coming together effectively in a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

Ireland experienced a significant increase in [[crosssectoral_and_interdisciplinary_collaboration_for_climate_policy | cross-collaboration]] among agencies, government departments, and voluntary groups to support vulnerable communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. This highlighted the flexible, adaptive, and innovative nature of public sector workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:26]</a>.

A general consensus emerged that public employees are essential to communities and societies, proving to be flexible and skilled in adapting their work methods, often without adequate prior training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. The crisis has reinforced the importance of [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | cross-agency]] and cross-team [[international_collaboration_in_crisis_management | collaboration]], even though this is often challenging for large organizations with their own priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

## Developing Resilience and Future Skills

To further develop resilience in public workforces, emphasis must be placed on:
*   **Digital Skills:** Efficient use of digital technologies in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. The crisis has accelerated the need for strong foundational skills in digital and [[the_role_of_data_in_crisis_management_and_resilience_building | data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>.
*   **Learning Organizations:** Public service should become a learning organization, continuously investing in people, their skills, and their workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. The most important skill for the future is the ability to continuously learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>.
*   **Intergenerational Cooperation:** Promoting cooperation between older, experienced civil servants and younger, more digitally savvy employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>.
*   **[[leadership_and_teamwork_in_crisis_management | Leadership]] and Soft Skills:** Managers and leaders need learning agility and emotional intelligence to guide people through change and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. There is a growing realization that skills like influencing, communicating, and bringing people together are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.
*   **Specialists and Generalists:** Maintaining a balance between specialists (e.g., HR, project management, cyber security, [[the_role_of_data_in_crisis_management_and_resilience_building | data]]) and generalists in the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>.
*   **Communities of Practice:** Fostering knowledge sharing and learning across different groups and agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>.
*   **Political Will:** The foundation for resilience is political will to invest in public services, reversing decades of cuts and understaffing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>.

## Opportunities for Rethinking Public Employment

The crisis presents a significant opportunity to rethink public employment models:
*   **Work-Life Balance and Remote Work:** Designing a job policy that maximizes the benefits of both remote and in-office work, defining which tasks are best performed where <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>. This includes supporting [[effective_communication_and_citizen_trust_in_crisis | employee well-being]] and preventing burnout, especially for those juggling work with family care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:39:00">[34:39:00]</a>.
*   **Distributed Leadership:** Building middle management teams to support distributed leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>.
*   **Public Service Hubs:** Creating multi-agency public service hubs closer to where people live, reducing commute times and fostering inter-agency connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:44:00">[39:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:19:00">[44:19:00]</a>.
*   **Public Service Mobility and Surge Reserves:** Developing a "surge reserve" workforce that can be rapidly mobilized across agencies and even to state agencies during future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:20:00">[41:20:00]</a>. This ensures the right people are in the right places when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:36:00">[41:36:00]</a>.
*   **Changing Management Culture:** Building trust in employees, motivating them, and prioritizing [[leadership_and_teamwork_in_crisis_management | crisis management skills]] for leaders, especially in communication with remote teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:00">[35:11:00]</a>. Leaders must be visible and adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:25:00">[46:25:00]</a>.
*   **Flexibility of Skills, Not Contracts:** Focusing on "flexibilities" in terms of skills and adaptability to community needs, rather than relying on precarious employment contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:52:00">[47:52:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Vision:** Preparing for future multi-faceted threats, such as the climate crisis and social instabilities, requiring a strong public administration structure and the right competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:59:00">[48:59:00]</a>.
*   **Narrative Change:** Shifting the narrative about public administration from being a cost to being a crucial investment that strengthens democratic institutions and provides social recognition for public service workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:11:00">[50:11:00]</a>.

## Risks and Pitfalls to Avoid

Despite the opportunities, several risks and pitfalls need to be managed:
*   **Work-Life Balance Challenges:** The risks associated with remote work, such as blurred lines between work and home, potential burnout, and the social component of office work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:38:00">[33:38:00]</a>.
*   **Political Competition:** Allowing emergencies to become political tools for competition between political parties or different levels of government, which can hinder the effectiveness of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide and Equity:** Ensuring that remote work is fair and proportionate, addressing challenges for those without adequate physical space or equipment at home, and mitigating the disproportionate impact on women due to care burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:00">[28:42:00]</a>.
*   **Unintended Consequences of Remote Work:** Concerns about remote workers being "out of sight, out of mind" in terms of visibility for promotion, and the challenge of supporting informal networks and "coffee table conversations" that spark ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:36:00">[44:36:00]</a>.
*   **Unconscious Bias:** Preventing a "re-traditionalization" of roles that could arise from remote working practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:59:00">[45:59:00]</a>.
*   **Loss of Credibility:** Addressing the loss of credibility of governments to strengthen democratic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:04:00">[51:04:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Unionization and Collective Bargaining:** Ensuring that workers have the right to organize and form unions, and that collective bargaining is a tool to address problems and improve working conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:14:00">[52:14:00]</a>.

## Commitment to the Future

The general sentiment from public service leaders is that there is no going back to how things were before the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:02:00">[55:02:00]</a>. The shift to a more flexible and resilient public sector model is the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:10:00">[56:10:00]</a>. Key commitments for the future include:
*   **Embracing "One Public Service" Principles:** Continuing to embed [[intergovernmental_and_crosssectoral_collaboration | collaborative]] ways of working into governance arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:38:00">[38:38:00]</a>.
*   **Investing in People:** Prioritizing people in the civil service, ensuring the right individuals are in the right positions, and continuously supporting their adaptation and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
*   **Promoting Positive Stories:** Actively telling the positive stories of public service contributions during the crisis to build recognition and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.
*   **Fostering Diversity of Thought and [[leadership_and_teamwork_in_crisis_management | Leadership]]:** Identifying and nurturing new ideas and leadership from unexpected places within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_systems_thinking_in_crisis_management | Systemic]] Preparedness:** Equipping civil servants with the skills and capacity to respond to future instabilities, including natural disasters and social crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.
*   **Supporting [[leadership_and_teamwork_in_crisis_management | Leader Well-being]]:** Recognizing that leaders also need to manage their own physical and mental well-being to lead by example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Continued Learning:** Providing ongoing training and development opportunities for the workforce to adapt to evolving job roles and digital environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

The key to success lies in embedding the collaborative spirit observed during the crisis into a long-term strategic vision for public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>.

Sludge audits are a methodological approach to identify, quantify, and address "sludge" in government services and processes. Sludge refers to unnecessary frictions that impede access to public services, impose psychological costs, and erode trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. This concept, popularized by Professor Cass Sunstein, aims to apply a behavioral lens to simplify administrative burdens and improve user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

## Understanding Sludge

While "nudge" makes accessing public services easier, "sludge" represents the unjustified frictions that make it harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. Sludge in government is often unintentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

Common examples include:
*   Information that is difficult to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>
*   Processes that are hard to understand or complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>
*   Long waiting times without updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>
*   Complex decision points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>

A key contribution of the sludge concept is its emphasis on **psychological costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. These can be categorized as:
*   **Search costs**: Incurred when people struggle to find information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
*   **Decision costs**: Psychological burden from evaluating difficult options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.
*   **Cognitive costs**: Mental resources expended to fulfill requirements or understand complex information (referred to as "brain capital") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional costs**: Including stigma, loss of autonomy, stress, disempowerment, anxiety, or frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

Sludge disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, who are most reliant on public services and susceptible to psychological burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. Sludge reduction is not solely about administrative efficiency, but about reshaping public services to be more equitable, accessible, and trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

Behavioral science highlights how human tendencies like unrealistic optimism, procrastination, and present bias can make navigating sludge particularly challenging, especially for those experiencing cognitive scarcity due to illness, poverty, or other struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:09:00">[52:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:34:00">[53:34:00]</a>.

## The New South Wales Sludge Audit Method

Developed by the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Customer Service, the NSW sludge audit method has been used for four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. It integrates behavioral science evidence, quantifies sludge, and provides a data-driven way to prioritize and measure the impact of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.

The method consists of seven steps and focuses on four key metrics:
*   Time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>
*   Cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>
*   Effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>
*   Inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>

A "Sludge Finder" web tool and other resources form the sludge audit toolkit, which supports the application of this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>.

## The First [[international_collaboration_on_sludge_reduction | International Sludge Academy]]

The OECD and the NSW government partnered to pilot the NSW sludge audit methodology outside Australia through the first [[international_collaboration_on_sludge_reduction | International Sludge Academy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>.
*   **Participants**: 16 teams from 14 countries were selected from 22 interested countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>.
*   **Process**: Countries attended masterclasses, received one-on-one mentorship, reviewed results, and developed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>. They also shared learnings throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">[21:29:00]</a>.
*   **Scope**: A diverse range of citizen-facing public services and internal government processes (e.g., HR services) were audited, pushing the boundaries of the method's application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>.

### Key Learnings and Principles

From the first [[international_collaboration_on_sludge_reduction | International Sludge Academy]], nine good practice principles were identified to support governments in assessing and preventing sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>.

These principles include:
*   **Controllability**: Selecting processes where there is sufficient control to implement changes and ensure solutions arise from the audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>.
*   **Methodology**: Using a predefined, common, tested, and rigorous methodology allows for replicability and comparisons across different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>.
*   **Tailoring**: Adapting the audit to specific contexts, including complicated, non-linear behavioral journeys and different customer segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a>.
*   **Equity Lens**: Crucially, deploying an equity lens throughout the process to address how sludge disproportionately affects underserved communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>.
*   **Evaluating Progress**: Translating audits into tangible changes on the ground, using behavioral frameworks, and re-auditing to measure impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:37:00">[26:37:00]</a>.
*   **System Enablers**: Identifying necessary conditions for successful sludge prevention programs, such as government commitment to improving user services, close connection to service owners, and systematic customer survey data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>.

### Case Studies

### France
The French behavioral insights team applied the sludge audit method to the "Assistance for Independent Living" (APA) application process, which helps elderly people receive aid to stay at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>. The administration sought help with high breakout rates and inconsistent letter versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>.

The audit involved:
*   Interviewing 20 people across 9 departments, including caregivers, applicants, and professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>.
*   Reviewing existing forms and going step-by-step through the application process with applicants to identify time, effort, and emotional costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>.

Key takeaways included:
*   The process was user-centric, helping the administration understand the user's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>.
*   It provided an objective and multi-dimensional analysis of complexities, including psychological costs and inclusion issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:13:00">[34:13:00]</a>.
*   It enabled autonomous diagnosis and replication for the administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>.
Challenges identified included a lack of objective data and the need for process familiarity to gain efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:00">[34:58:00]</a>.

### Brazil
Brazil's Ministry of Management and Innovation Public Services audited the recovery process for the "gov.br" account, which is the main entry point for over 4,000 digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>. The audit focused on the online form recovery process for vulnerable users who cannot use automated digital or facial recognition methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>. This process affects millions of people, with over 100 million recovery requests annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>.

Brazil is developing its own sludge audit tool, emphasizing a systematic approach and adapting it to Portuguese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a>. The tool recognizes different user journeys for diverse citizen groups and incorporates an equity check to identify where more guidance is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:29:00">[39:29:00]</a>. Their goal is to create a self-applied tool for federal, state, and municipal governments across Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:00">[40:28:00]</a>.

Key insights from Brazil:
*   Sludge audits are a good entry point for behavioral insights in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:56:00">[40:56:00]</a>.
*   Sludge audit tools themselves should be designed to avoid sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:09:00">[41:09:00]</a>.
*   The term "sludge" can be difficult to communicate; positive framing is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:46:00">[41:46:00]</a>.
*   Sludge reduction is crucial for promoting inclusiveness, equity, and public perception of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:59:00">[41:59:00]</a>.

## Future Directions and Global Impact

There is a significant surge in the adoption of sludge audits globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>. This work extends beyond behavioral science teams, aiming to benefit program, policy, and service delivery teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:19:00">[43:19:00]</a>.

The OECD and NSW plan to launch a second [[international_collaboration_on_sludge_reduction | International Sludge Academy]] to further mainstream these efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:39:00">[42:39:00]</a>. Future plans include:
*   Emphasizing peer learning among the growing community of teams conducting sludge audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:47:00">[43:47:00]</a>.
*   Developing the methodology further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:08:00">[43:08:00]</a>.
*   Involving experts from various fields like customer experience and data science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:22:00">[44:22:00]</a>.
*   Benchmarking common processes (e.g., passport renewal) across countries to identify opportunities for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:40:00">[44:40:00]</a>.
*   Leveraging [[international_collaboration_on_sludge_reduction | international collaboration]] to compare findings and build an evidence base of global best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>.

This commitment to sludge reduction aligns with the OECD's broader objective of building trust in public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Improving the quality of public services directly influences how citizens perceive their governments and drives trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. The OECD is also developing an international standard on human-centered public administrative services, which is open for public consultation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

Ultimately, sludge reduction is about giving people more time and enhancing their dignity by making government services more accessible and easier to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:35:00">[55:35:00]</a>.

The [[oecd_declaration_on_public_sector_innovation | OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation]] is a draft document currently managed by Rebecca Santos, an advisor with the secretary of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] at the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The declaration's purpose is to spur innovation action and provide a common reference and guidelines for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. It represents an attempt to achieve common agreement at the international level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

## National Experiences with Declarations

### Canada's Declaration on Public Sector Innovation

Canada's Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] has been in place for a couple of years, with the OECD's global efforts building on this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The initiative began in 2015 when heads of public services across Canada, including federal, provincial, and territorial governments, discussed public service renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. These non-political discussions focused on ensuring the public service kept pace with changes outside the public sector, transformed, and remained relevant to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Common challenges identified included leveraging data and digital technologies more impactfully, and engaging citizens in co-creating solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Annual gatherings on [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] led to the idea of a declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The Canadian declaration is non-binding but sends a signal across all systems that public service leaders are committed to trying new things, taking risks, testing ideas, and acknowledging that not everything will work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Its ultimate goal is to deliver better policies and programs to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Drafted in early 2017, the document includes aspirational statements on new partnerships, data, technology, and funding models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The declaration aims to resonate across all layers of the public service, empowering employees to pursue new and transformative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Signed in November 2017, it marked the first time all heads of public services in Canada signed a joint document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. It functions as a signpost for decision-makers, indicating that senior leaders encourage innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. It also helps engage provincial and territorial colleagues in co-creating solutions, fostering a sense of shared risk-taking and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### France's Manifesto for Public Sector Innovation

The French Manifesto for [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] was released in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. It arose from a growing interest in innovation within French administration in 2016, evidenced by the creation of a new generation of public labs across regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. There was a demand to define [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] within the French context and provide guidelines, as many public servants were new to concepts like labs, design, and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The manifesto aimed to explain and argue that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] can yield serious results if approached correctly, not merely as a passing trend or isolated event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. It clarifies that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is a new approach to public policymaking that can significantly impact policy and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

One of its most immediate results was providing a common reference text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. It serves as an official national guideline to define and promote [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The manifesto spread virally among French [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovators]], providing a basis and legitimacy for their projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. It helps innovators assure others that their work is serious and can have an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The manifesto has been a key tool in developing a community of public innovators, now numbering 600-700 people, by establishing a shared vision and mindset to change the culture of French public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Challenges and Reactions

Both the Canadian and French declarations faced initial difficulties or ongoing challenges.
In France, there were initial difficulties getting the manifesto endorsed by leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Hostility or a lack of seriousness from many in top administration persists, as they may not understand or wish to work differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. The manifesto alone is not enough to transform governments, and high-level political figures haven't used it as a magical solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

In Canada, the declaration was received well in some circles and acknowledged in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. While gains are being made in moving innovation from a "side of desk" activity to a "center of desk" one, full mainstreaming has not yet been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Perceptions of innovation and experimentation within government still present issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. The concept of innovation and experimentation is still in its infancy or adolescent phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. The declaration itself faced no direct negative reactions; any challenges reflect the ongoing work to advance innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

Despite challenges, both experiences indicate that declarations are a way to cohere language around [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and establish key drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

## OECD's Approach to the Declaration

The OECD's draft declaration aims to bring countries together, recognizing that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is context-dependent and often leads to segmented patterns of behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. It seeks to signal that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] matters and is an integral part of how things are done, rather than just an add-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

The declaration is based heavily on the OECD's work with and learning from countries, including a detailed study with the public service of Canada on their [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. While [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is crucial for addressing modern challenges, it is not always the most appropriate choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. The goal is to embed [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] as a more systemic activity across government, as the current rate of innovation may not match current needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

A key challenge is the multifaceted nature of the word "innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. The OECD seeks to build a more accessible language around it by unpacking its meaning and recognizing its different forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. This led to the concept of **innovation facets**, which are incorporated into the declaration's underlying thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>:
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation**: Improving existing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented innovation**: Achieving ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation**: Responding to a changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation**: Engaging with weak signals early to shape change rather than just react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

Governments must maintain a portfolio approach to [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], hedging their bets across these facets to be ready for unpredictable challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. The declaration attempts to codify this language to tell a richer story about why [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] matters, how governments support it, and how all public servants can play a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

The declaration emphasizes the need to embrace and enhance existing [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], equip public servants, foster new partnerships, and involve diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. It acknowledges that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is a continually evolving practice that requires continuous learning and sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.

## Public Consultation Process

The public consultation process for the draft declaration opened in November 2018 and concludes on February 22, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. Feedback can be submitted by individuals, organizations, groups, or on behalf of a country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

The OECD seeks specific types of contributions to iterate the document:
*   Tell us what makes sense or doesn't make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.
*   Suggest rephrasing directives or finessing possible actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.
*   Point out terminology that doesn't make sense (e.g., "weak signals") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a> or requires further explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.
*   Provide language suggestions, especially if words have different meanings in different cultural contexts (e.g., "civil servant" vs. "public servant") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
*   Inform if proposed actions or activities are useful or impossible in a specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.
*   Share possible implications of certain activities or directives in a country's context (e.g., how "failure" in experimentation aligns with auditing purposes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

Feedback from anyone working in or alongside government, from the community, and from academia is welcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. The current purpose is to iterate the draft to make it as strong as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

### Different Levels of Government

While the OECD primarily works with national governments, it is interested in the perspectives of local governments and local innovation ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. [[Public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] must be considered from an ecosystem perspective, as no single level or body of government can successfully address all issues or innovate alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. Different governments have varying degrees of decentralization, affecting the role of local and state governments in the innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. Even without official standing, local bodies can affirm their commitment to the declaration as a signal to stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.

### Nature and Purpose of the OECD Declaration

The declaration is intended to be an official OECD instrument but is **not legally binding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. Member countries can affirm their commitment to its ideals without being formally measured on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. Signing on signals the importance of innovation in a government's operations and provides a source of good ideas, possible actions, and directives to inform their [[public_sector_innovation_strategies | innovation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. It is intended to help governments take a portfolio approach to innovation, covering all possible kinds of innovation for various challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. The ultimate aim is for countries to use it to inspire the management of diverse innovation strategies and reflect on how their system supports [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

### Key Themes and Enablers

*   **Citizen Participation**: Citizen participation is considered a crucial part of an effective [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] process, as innovation relies on understanding different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. Governments are encouraged to seek and listen to diverse voices, and the OECD is collaborating on calls for innovations demonstrating citizen engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Skills**: The OECD is conducting ongoing work on leadership and skills for [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], examining the mindsets and skills required to develop innovation competency within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. Different forms of leadership are needed at various stages of the innovation process, from problem understanding and ecosystem engagement to implementation and making innovation "stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>. This requires an ecosystem of diverse players, as one person may not possess all necessary skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. This area is still a work in progress, with more learning needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

The public consultation is a key step towards making the declaration a useful document that reflects genuine feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. After the public consultation closes, the draft will be proposed within the OECD to the Public Governance Committee for further consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

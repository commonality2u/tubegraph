Governments face a crucial imperative to innovate and adapt, not only to address existing issues but also to prepare for a rapidly changing and uncertain future. This necessity stems from three primary drivers: the persistence of unsolved problems, the dynamic evolution of the global environment, and the need to anticipate future [[challenges faced by governments | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Reasons for Government Innovation

### 1. Unsolved Problems and Impactful Solutions

Governments have not yet resolved all the problems their citizens face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. To become more impactful, governments must innovate and change their approaches to deliver new or better value for their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This requires developing more impactful solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### 2. Adapting to a Changing World

The world is constantly changing around governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Many existing governmental [[systems thinking in government during crises | systems]], such as healthcare, welfare, and taxation, were designed in eras like the 1950s and do not align with today's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Key aspects of this changing environment include:
*   **Digitalization:** People now conduct many activities and use services online, expecting the same ease of experience when interacting with government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Evolving Societal Needs:** As individuals, our needs are changing, meaning governments must respond to the new demands that accompany evolving societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Governments must both respond to these changes in the world around them, adapting to emerging new [[systems thinking in government during crises | systems]] like digital technologies, and address the new needs arising from changing societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The environment itself around governments is changing, necessitating adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### 3. Anticipating Future Challenges

Beyond current adaptations, governments must also look forward and prepare for fundamental changes and [[challenges faced by governments that require innovation | challenges]] that lie ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The future is characterized by complex [[challenges faced by governments | challenges]] and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Examples of such future [[challenges faced by governments | challenges]] include:
*   Climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Aging populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Emergence of new types of societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

Governments must prepare for and [[Future of Government Anticipation and Systems Thinking | anticipate the future]] to be [[Leadership and organizational readiness for future challenges | ready for tomorrow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This requires innovation and a different kind of thinking today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This anticipation is crucial for fundamental changes that will impact how government functions and, more importantly, how people function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The [[role of governments in innovation and future planning | role of governments]] is to embrace innovation across these three dimensions to effectively serve their citizens and navigate the complexities of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

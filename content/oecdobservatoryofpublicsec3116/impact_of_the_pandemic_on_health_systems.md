This session explores what the COVID-19 crisis has revealed about health systems and identifies future directions for reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It is part of the OECD's "Government After Shock" series, an experiment to gather mutual learnings from various localities and national studies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The series aims to identify what should be left behind, what should be kept from pre-crisis practices, and what needs to be done differently in light of system vulnerabilities to shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The insights from this session will contribute to an OECD "call to action" for governments and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Readiness and Initial Response

The crisis prompted incredibly rapid changes in health systems, particularly in the use of technology, rapid staff re-qualification and redeployment, and behavioral change communication with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Latvia's "Miracle" Response
Despite having one of the worst-funded health systems in the EU, Latvia described its response as a "miracle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The shock and stress led to effective regrouping and reorganization, leveraging strong health workers and a somewhat "old school" epidemiological service for testing and tracing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Cooperation with private service providers dramatically increased testing capacities in a very short period, marking a success story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This showcased that "people are more innovative than institutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Ireland's Challenges and Adaptations
Ireland's public health system was "absolutely not" ready for the level of change, facing shortages of critical care beds and grappling with a new health reform program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. A key challenge was building surge capacity for critical and acute beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. However, the willingness of staff, especially nursing staff, to undertake training and support surge preparations was fortunate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Most routine elective scheduled care had to be deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Recruitment for dedicated testing staff was also difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Many primary and community services were scaled back to redeploy resources to the COVID-19 response, causing backlogs in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Korea's Preparedness and Unique Factors
Korea's success in managing the crisis is attributed to three main factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>:
1.  **Diagnosis Capacity:** Early enhancement of PCR testing capacity allowed for over 25,000 tests per day, enabling all exposed and suspected patients to be tested within a day or even hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
2.  **Data Infrastructure:** Leveraging an existing national health insurance system covering 100% of the population, Korea developed a robust information infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Examples include a drug utilization system for real-time safety tracking and a mask distribution system that tracked purchasing history to cope with panic buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Clinicians could also check patients' risky travel history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
3.  **Governance:** All relevant organizations, including local governments, were linked under the central disaster management headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
These capabilities were possible due to a single unified health insurance system, nationally advanced information infrastructure, and lessons learned from the MERS crisis in 2015, which led to the building of a crisis management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The resilience and preparedness of the health system are linked to pre-existing healthcare delivery and universally operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
Korea's low case levels are also partly attributed to the public's common use of facial masks due to prior experiences with smog and pollution, and the strengthened infection control systems in hospitals since MERS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The use of credit card and CCTV information for epidemiological investigations also played a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. This highlights that readiness for health challenges involves not just health systems but also health literacy and behavioral change in the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

### Sweden's Preparedness and Digital Leap
Sweden was well-prepared for scaling up capacity, doubling ICU beds and maintaining availability from the start of the pandemic, ensuring good care for COVID patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. The country also made a "frog leap" in creating a digitalized health system, delivering services digitally for follow-up visits, chronic condition monitoring, prescriptions, and consultations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. National digital platforms were key for information and contacting health services, building high public trust in the health and public health response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
The pandemic also fostered tighter collaboration within Sweden's often fragmented health system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. While tools existed previously, the crisis brought an awareness of the importance of bridging gaps between national, regional, and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. The singular goal of tackling the pandemic simplified collaboration, a stark contrast to the usual wide-ranging health agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

### Israel's Agility and Cautionary Tale
Israel, with its tight health spending and thinly stretched healthcare system (nearly 100% bed occupancy in winter and low OECD health spending), faced an unfavorable starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. However, it was familiar with emergencies and had a long-standing, drilled pandemic contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
Four helpful aspects in the first wave included:
1.  **Proactive Elderly Protection:** Intensive efforts to inform and protect the elderly and high-risk groups, encouraging them to stay home, significantly reduced their proportion among infected cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
2.  **Early Mass Testing:** Large-scale, free PCR testing was implemented early, reaching one of the highest rates globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.
3.  **Timely Care Adaptation:** Hospitals quickly adapted care, including refraining from early ventilation and using supportive care like proning, contributing to Israel's low case fatality rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
4.  **Rapid Online Care Transition:** Leveraging existing digital health infrastructure, the focus quickly shifted to proactive online management of chronic diseases and preventive medicine, which had been impacted by lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.

## Managing the "Double Burden"

The first lockdown led to hospitals largely focusing on COVID-19, cancelling non-emergency services, which resulted in increased deaths from heart attacks, strokes, and other diseases beyond COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. Countries in the second wave have tried to maintain non-emergency services.

### Latvia's Reorganization
In spring, Latvia closed all planned services to keep hospital beds vacant for COVID-19, despite low patient numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. This heavily affected accessibility for planned services, exacerbating already long waiting lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. For the second wave, the goal is to keep healthcare open as long as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. They are reorganizing bed capacities for COVID patients by shrinking ambulatory care, not planned care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. Tailor-made solutions are being developed for small regional hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
A major challenge is the shortage of healthcare workers, many of whom work in multiple places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Restricting workers to one location would shut down almost half the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. Latvia is balancing safety, accessibility, and effective COVID patient care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Efforts are also underway to develop home healthcare, providing patients with portable oxygen monitoring systems and leveraging family doctors as a fundamental pillar for home services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. The constraint is not beds, but rather the number of health workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.

### Ireland's Digital and Community Approach
Ireland also faced a backlog, with key workers self-isolating and widespread weariness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>. They utilized e-health by rolling out telehealth in GP practices and OPD clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. The implementation of electronic transfer of prescriptions, previously resisted, was fast-forwarded and represents a huge change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. A COVID-19 tracker tracing app was also used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
A significant focus has been on community support in health and well-being, including trying to prevent illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>. The health budget for well-being increased from 6 million to 20 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. Local authorities launched "community call" initiatives, with public and sporting organizations like the GAA helping elderly people, demonstrating strong public buy-in and goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

### Sweden's Public Health Approach
Sweden explicitly avoided a full lockdown in the first wave to preserve the rest of the health system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. Schools remained open to avoid negative health impacts on pupils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>. This public health approach to measures has worked, with no significant increase in suicidal rates or mental health illness observed in statistics yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
In the first wave, resource reallocation led to the suspension of screening programs, elective surgery, and other planned care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>. Many patients also avoided scheduled appointments, leading to some primary healthcare clinics having a lack of patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. In the second wave, the health system bounced back quickly, and elective surgery is largely back on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
However, the health workforce is very tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. Positively, applications to doctor and nurse programs have increased by 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. There is an increased need to invest in preventive measures and public health to tackle increasing waiting times, as performing more surgical interventions alone is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

### Israel's Proactive Second Wave Management
In the first wave, Israel shared the common problem of focusing primarily on COVID-19, with insufficient attention paid to the "double burden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. However, in the serious second wave, management was "completely differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. Hospitals did not stop elective procedures, and community-focused care, including primary health care, preventive medicine, and proactive care by GPs, continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.
Emphasis was placed on maintaining all services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>. Kalalit, a healthcare provider, created predictive, proactive approaches to identify specific domains where intervention was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. This included proactively calling patients who missed prescriptions or appointments for cancer or other non-communicable diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. Predictive analytics were used to find patients at high risk of deterioration, prompting physicians to proactively approach them and follow specific steps to prevent worsening conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.

### Korea's Segregated Care Approach
While not experiencing a total lockdown, a high prevalence period in Daegu necessitated dividing care facilities into three levels:
1.  **General Hospitals:** To treat severe COVID-19 patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.
2.  **Living Care Centers:** Low-level care centers with health personnel to manage patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.
3.  **Home Isolation:** With regular checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.
Despite concerns, there was no increase in 30-day mortality for other diseases like myocardial infarction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. Hospitals were designated for specific types of care: COVID-19, non-COVID respiratory diseases, and other diseases, effectively separating patient movement tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>.

## Future Directions and Lessons Learned

### Integrating Public Health with Wider Policy
Public health is a complex public policy issue, inextricably linked to the economy, jobs, education, and public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
In Ireland, public health funding increased by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. The "Sláintecare" reform aims to deliver health in the right place at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. Alternative approaches like e-medicine and online consultations are being explored, along with campaigns to tackle obesity and promote physical activity and mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. Community buy-in to wellness campaigns has been crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>. Policies are primarily guided by public health experts, with political leaders generally following their advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. The pandemic has provided opportunities to accelerate wellness initiatives and foster a genuine appreciation for the health service, which was previously a "political football" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

In Latvia, the pandemic has provided an opportunity to end the "false dilemma" of health versus economy, a struggle for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. Experts emphasize that an adequate response to pandemics involves a universal health care approach and health promotion, which are strongly tied to socioeconomic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. While governments try to follow expert advice, tough political decisions can sometimes lead to deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.

### Accelerated Trends and New Learnings
The health crisis largely accelerated existing trends, such as digitalization, patient-centeredness, collaboration in health systems, and focus on public health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>. However, it also forced a rethinking of societal organization, particularly the over-reliance on timely delivery and lack of strategic reserves for medical equipment and PPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.
A key new learning for Sweden is the need to be more adaptive and react faster to crises, moving away from slow, old systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. The crisis also highlights the importance of working much better with civil society and industry, building new pathways for collaboration that should have existed before the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>.

In Korea, the pandemic has led people to necessitate a redesign of the health system towards a more public sector-dominant model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>. It's an opportunity to rethink what constitutes a good health system and its resilience and preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. A major realization is the increased importance of "safety," not just in patient safety but as a form of human security at the national level, deeply linked with other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. A good health system protects patients from many crises, requiring a strong healthcare delivery system and universal health care coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

For Israel, the pandemic was the "best accelerator of digital health" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. Long-standing resistance pockets (bureaucracy, red tape, union worries) were eliminated in days, allowing for rapid adoption of digital solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. Once digital, there is no going back to "analog medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. This shift will continue, leading to a new equilibrium where the proportion of online care will change with illness waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. The true [[impact of Covid19 on digital transformation in the public sector | digital transformation]] involves redesigning care processes augmented by technology, not just digitizing broken systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.
A hopeful wish is that governments realize the [[the_economic_impact_of_the_pandemic_and_recovery_strategies | economic impact of the pandemic]] on maintaining a barely sustainable, fully stretched healthcare system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>. Maintaining safety margins for healthcare systems is crucial for this and future pandemics, as pandemics are here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.

### Changes in Public Behavior and Future Commitments
While data on lifestyle changes in chronic disease patients is limited, Korea observed that the use of medical services by chronic disease patients increased slightly, while elective surgery decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>. This suggests that the crisis did not fundamentally alter patient utility behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>.
In Ireland, opportunities exist with more people working from home and reflecting on life's priorities, leading to increased savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>.

Key personal commitments for the future, in light of the crisis:
*   **Ran Balicer (Israel):** Remember that it's not over until it's over; maintaining vigilance in a public health crisis is crucial to avoid history repeating itself as a tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.
*   **Ilze Viņķele (Latvia):** Focus more on tackling inequalities in society, as the lack of savings can force people to work with mild symptoms, undermining restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>.
*   **Sun Min Kim (Korea):** Stress building a sound healthcare delivery system and universal health coverage to prepare for new crises, as these are critically important for a resilient and prepared healthcare system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.
*   **Olivia Wigzell (Sweden):** Speed up agency processes for developing knowledge support and data-driven analysis to maintain relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>. Increase the use of pooled health data registers for research and statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>. Provide clearer messages on priorities, reduce the number of priorities that confuse providers, and foster closer collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.
*   **Frank Feighan (Ireland):** Continue to delegate the importance of technology in delivering care (teleconsultations, e-prescribing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. Build on [[impact of COVID19 on global cooperation | global cooperation]] structures with organizations like the EU and WHO, as national responses alone are insufficient for global problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

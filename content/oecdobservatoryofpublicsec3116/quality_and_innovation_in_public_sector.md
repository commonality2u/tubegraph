The overarching objective in the [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]] is to design better policies, regulations, and services in an inclusive, co-creative, transparent, accountable, and trustworthy manner, adjusting them to the needs of customers, citizens, and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This requires exploring the deep connection between quality and [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) and Innovation
The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) is a tool that helps organizations assess their performance and readiness for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. There is an ongoing debate about whether [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] creates a platform for quality or if quality practices foster an environment for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Research indicates that both processes are essential and interconnected, and they should not be treated separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. CAF assists organizations in preparing for uncertainties by promoting constant learning and understanding their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

CAF is more than just a quality tool; it cultivates attributes that position [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]] organizations to overcome disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. It changes the mindset of the organization and its staff through a holistic approach to performance analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The 2020 CAF model explicitly includes [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], mentioning it 50 times and reinforcing its presence compared to the 2013 version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. It is included in [[principles_of_public_sector_innovation | Principle 6 of Excellence]], which focuses on continuous learning, [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. Criteria 2, regarding strategy and planning, also mentions managing change and [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] in an agile way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

## Characteristics of Resilient and Innovative Organizations
A 2021 global resilience report by Deloitte identifies five characteristics of resilient and [[public_sector_innovation | innovative]] organizations, all of which are embedded in the CAF model and its [[principles_of_public_sector_innovation | principles of excellence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>:
*   **Be Prepared**: Organizations with clear short- and long-term priorities, strategies, and planning outperform others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Be Adaptable**: Utilize an adaptable workforce with flexible teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Be Collaborative**: Increase collaboration both inside and outside the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Be Trustworthy**: Build trust between leaders and employees, and ensure transparency within and outside the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Be Responsible**: Responsibility extends beyond the bottom line and allows adaptation in response to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

CAF helps organizations become more resilient and fit for the future by assessing their preparedness for crises and supporting new developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>.

## Case Studies of Public Sector Innovation

### Vienna City Administration
Vienna has a long history of using CAF, implementing it for almost 20 years with mutual agreement between political and administrative levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. The city employs a range of quality management methods, including ISO 9001 and the EFQM excellence model, finding that CAF blends perfectly with these models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

CAF acts as a coach for organizational and cultural development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. [[Public Sector Innovation | Innovation]] requires a space and a perfect basic organizational development where it can thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. It needs a solid foundation and connection to benefit citizens and all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. CAF helps foster a new culture where everyone's contribution is valued, promoting continuous improvement and [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. By detecting maturity levels and focusing on closing the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle, CAF assists in organizational development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This systematic improvement leads to increased awareness of strengths, preparedness for improvement options, and identifying potentials, making the organization fitter, more agile, and resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

Vienna emphasizes that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] requires preparedness, planning, and consideration of impact and outcome, guiding citizens as partners through the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. CAF also serves as a doorway to mutual exchange of experience and development among organizations, facilitating learning and inspiring [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

### Krakow City Administration
Krakow City Office has used CAF since 2011, conducting four self-assessments that have led to several improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. The 2017 assessment highlighted communication with clients as a key area for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. This focus became particularly important during the COVID-19 crisis when traditional communication channels were limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

Improvements implemented include:
*   **Taxpayer Portal (2018)**: An electronic tool with an information platform on local taxes and a personalized communication channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. It allows citizens to check tax liabilities, launch declarations, and pay taxes online, significantly reducing telephone inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Official Language (2019)**: Guidelines for writing documents and training workshops were provided to officials to make communication more inclusive and understandable, improving citizen satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.
*   **Parcel Lockers for City Services (2020)**: Inspired by the pandemic, this innovation allows citizens to receive physical documents (e.g., license plates) at parcel lockers at their convenience, reducing the need for in-person office visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. This solution is expected to remain even after the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>.
*   **Integrated City Contact Center (2021)**: This upcoming project aims to centralize information and answer questions about various city and municipal services, reducing telephone queues and clarifying which unit handles specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

Krakow's experience demonstrates that CAF serves as a trigger, inspiring new ideas and projects, rather than providing ready-made solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. The initial motivation for implementing CAF was financial, driven by European Union funding for management tools, but the positive results led to continued commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.

### Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and Sports
The Slovenian Ministry's first CAF self-assessment identified the need for an employee survey to gauge satisfaction, organizational climate, and understanding of the ministry's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. This led to a collaborative initiative with other public bodies to create a uniform methodology for comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>. Seven organizations voluntarily responded, fostering a partnership based on professionalism, a shared desire for improvement, and enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.

The "Employee Eyes" questionnaire was developed in two months, incorporating modules on organizational climate, employee satisfaction, and energy vitality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. The objective was to gain insights for strategic decisions, develop a uniform methodology, allow for customization, and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>. The team focused on including items that could be translated into actionable plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. Key to success is the dissemination of results to all employees and, most importantly, the implementation phase, which requires significant resources and effort to act upon the findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. This cooperation among CAF users at a national level is vital for the model's further development and improved results in [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]] organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.

## Impact of COVID-19 and CAF's Role in Future Resilience
The COVID-19 crisis necessitated swift responses from [[public_sector_innovation | public administrations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. Key changes included:
*   Increased cross-ministerial coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>.
*   Rise in government expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.
*   Approval of emergency regulations, often with exceptions to regulatory impact assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   New health and sanitary protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
*   Rapid digitalization of services and widespread teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>.
*   New communication protocols to combat misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

Post-COVID priorities include restoring growth, protecting vulnerable groups, building a green economy, debt sustainability, and employment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>. These priorities demand new thinking, including spending better, addressing global challenges (like climate change), fostering inclusiveness, and rebuilding trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>.

To be fit for the future, [[public_sector_innovation | public administrations]] need to strengthen their resilience to future shocks by focusing on preparedness, agility (including digital transformation and remote work), cultivating skills for complex problem-solving and [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], developing foresight capacities, strengthening coordination and communication, and embedding cross-cutting challenges like environmental concerns and digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.

CAF can help assess preparedness and resilience across different dimensions, identifying long-term innovations that emerged during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. This includes assessing leadership adaptability, contingency plans, teleworking policies, HR strategies, partnerships, and procurement procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>. A project led by Belgium with 10 other countries, including Slovenia, and supported by the OECD and the European Commission, aims to gather lessons from the crisis, promote emerging [[public_sector_innovation | innovations]], and support the CAF network to strengthen the model's use and development for a more resilient [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.

## Impact of CAF on Human Resource Management
A poll conducted during the session revealed that participants believe Human Resource Management issues are most significantly affected by the use of CAF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. This aligns with a Slovenian study which found a major [[impact_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | significant impact of CAF implementation]] on human resource management and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis highlighted weaknesses and areas for improvement in human resource management, emphasizing the need for a step-by-step approach to reform, as working methods, including remote and hybrid models, have fundamentally changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. This includes challenges in areas such as knowledge management in a remote working environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.

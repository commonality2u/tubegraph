The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed a fundamental shift in the operational landscape for governments, highlighting the urgent need for adaptation in an era defined by continuous flux and complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This imperative for [[understanding_adaptive_innovation | understanding adaptive innovation]] extends beyond crisis response to shaping future outcomes and ensuring long-term societal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Myth of Predictability

Historically, 20th-century governments were designed for predictable environments, where behaviors were expected, routines established, and knowledge bases readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, served as a stark reminder that such stability is often fictional, and the future can be highly uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. In this context, governments cannot afford to stand still or pause, as the cost of late action or inaction can be "terribly high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Embracing a "Never Normal" Reality

A key insight from the pandemic is that the idea of "normal" has been shown to be a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Rather than moving from one stable equilibrium to another, society is entering a "never normal" situation of continuous fluidity, flux, and turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This necessitates constant adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The prevailing metaphor of "war on the virus" is imperfect because there is no clear enemy or finite end point in such complex and [[sensemaking_and_organizational_adaptation | adaptive problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Instead, the virus is part of an ecology, a natural living ecosystem, requiring more natural-based responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### Interdependence: Biological and Moral

The crisis has highlighted two levels of interdependence:
*   **Biological Interdependence** All individuals are interconnected, and challenges are global, complex, and deeply systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This points to serious vulnerabilities in global value chains, resource management, and planetary boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Solutions must be more collective and integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Moral Interdependence** The crisis has revealed that societies are not safe if individuals disregard community well-being or if the most vulnerable are disproportionately affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. A stronger sense of moral connections is crucial for responding to the complexity of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Pillars of Government Adaptation

### From Prediction to Preparation and Learning
Governments need to shift from trying to predict the future to using ideas about the future to make better decisions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This involves learning, unlearning old, flawed assumptions, and finding new ways of operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. The ability to learn, and the speed of learning, are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. This involves "emergent learning," where what is best constantly changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### Anticipatory Governance and Scenario Planning
Rather than relying on fixed worldviews or specific assumptions about how things will shape up, governments should use tools like scenario planning to consider and contemplate different versions of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Finland, for example, has a long tradition of future work in government and parliament, which has helped during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. The next step is to integrate this [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | anticipatory governance]] approach more strongly into mainstream political discussion and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

### Learning and Experimentation
A culture of experimentation and learning is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. Governments should allow for [[managing_risk_and_experimentation_in_government | risk-managed experimentation]] for learning, even from negative results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This includes [[adaptive_innovation_examples_in_regulatory_systems | regulatory explorative work]] such as sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Finland's prime minister publicly stated a commitment to changing decisions as new evidence emerged, demonstrating a humble and decisive approach to trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.

### Cultivating Relationships and Trust
Strong relationships between different actors—across government, between public and private sectors, and with civil society—are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. Trust, comprised of credibility, reliability, and intimacy (understanding each other's viewpoints), is essential for multi-perspective learning processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. Citizens are more likely to trust government experiments and policies when they are involved in their co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. This implies a need for participatory government, where problems are deliberated collectively to find synergistic solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

### Government as Ecosystem Steward and Platform
Governments must move beyond traditional roles of regulator or provider of order to become ecosystem stewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. This means:
*   **Cross-Agency Coordination**: Adopting a "whole of government" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.
*   **Whole-of-Nation Coordination**: Facilitating collaboration among multiple sectors, businesses, community players, and individual citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
*   **Convening and Aggregating Interests**: Acting as platforms to bring different parties together for dialogue and combining diverse ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Place-Based Processes**: Recognizing the important role of cities in transformation through co-created priorities and tangible results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. This requires connecting national, local, and international efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

### Mindset Shifts for Capacity Management
To build the civil service of the future and effectively manage uncertainty, several mindset shifts are required:
*   **From Optimization to Resilience**: Allowing for ramp-up or spillover capacity instead of paring down resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **From Quantitative to Qualitative Indicators**: Incorporating ethnographic stories and qualitative data alongside numerical metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **From Output to Outcomes Focus**: Shifting attention to the broader impact rather than narrow performance metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
*   **From Linear to Exponential Approaches**: Recognizing that systemic capacity can lead to profound, non-linear effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **From Scarcity/Fixed Mindsets to Abundance/Growth Mindsets**: Embracing continuous learning, change, and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
*   **From Stable Equilibrium to Iterative Work**: Accepting that things may not be perfect initially but can be continuously adjusted through experimentation and prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   **From Siloed Thinking to Integration**: Allowing for local sub-optimization if it benefits the global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities

The challenges of the current era, such as [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation | climate change]] and inequality, require people to behave differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. Traditional methods of power, authority, or rational persuasion are often ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. A third model, learning by experience, is crucial for fostering internal motivation and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. This includes paying special attention to the most vulnerable, ensuring their voices are heard and their experiences inform solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.

There is a need to make wise investments in response to crises, using them to transform entire systems like production, mobility, energy, food, education, and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. These transformations cut across policy areas and require strong political leadership to shift culture, behavior, and work practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The pandemic itself serves as an example of the power of shared missions in driving prioritization and behavioral changes globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This crisis can be an opportunity to accelerate transformation, which also represents the biggest opportunity for value creation since the first industrial revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Addressing uncertainty in global collaborations | Addressing uncertainty in global collaborations]] and governing towards future outcomes demands a fundamental rethinking of how governments operate. This involves preparing rather than merely reacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, cultivating an ability to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>, building a sense of urgency for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>, and shaping quality relationships across all sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. Leaders must be able to hold opposing thoughts simultaneously and continue to function, balancing present needs with future considerations, and micro-level impacts with macro-system stewardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>.

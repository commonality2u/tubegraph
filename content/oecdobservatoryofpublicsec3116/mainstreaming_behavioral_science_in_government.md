"Logic: Good Practice Principles for Mainstreaming Behavioral Public Policy" is a report developed by the OECD to provide guidance and build capacity for the [[application_of_behavioral_science | application of behavioral science]] within governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Many governments worldwide seek support to establish behavioral science functions and learn from international experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The report distills lessons on what works and what doesn't in [[challenges_in_embedding_behavioral_science | embedding behavioral science]] into public policies and government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The "Logic" report addresses key questions such as how to set up a behavioral science function in government, identify optimal governance models, and ensure the sustained impact and sustainability of behavioral functions over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It is based on rigorous research, integrating data from governments globally with insights from behavioral science experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. These principles are designed to assist both those new to using behavioral science and those seeking to deepen and expand their existing impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## The Growing Landscape of Behavioral Science in Government

The OECD's work on behavioral science focuses on three main activities: convening a global network of experts, enabling governments to use behavioral science, and advising them on policy challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. "Logic" falls under the "enable" function, aiming to provide guidance and build capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

Globally, over 300 institutions are applying behavioral science to public policies, with accelerated growth in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This expansion is observed in two directions:
*   **Broadening:** A wider range of countries are establishing behavioral science functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Deepening:** Many countries now have multiple teams and functions across various government administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

The growth was likely accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was inherently a behavioral problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Governance arrangements for behavioral science vary significantly across countries, including dedicated units in central government, specific functions in line agencies, or dispersed expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The OECD tracks this growth and diversity through surveys, interviews with practitioners, and interactions with its network of experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Challenges in Embedding Behavioral Science

Despite this growth, practitioners face numerous [[challenges_in_embedding_behavioral_science | challenges in embedding behavioral science]], primarily related to institutional factors and the relationship between behavioral science teams and their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Interestingly, older, more mature teams often report more challenges, possibly because they encounter different situations over time and develop strategies to address them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The "Logic" report leverages collective knowledge from both experienced and new teams to identify effective practices for [[behavioral_public_policy | mainstreaming behavioral public policy]] and overcoming these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## What is Behavioral Public Policy?

[[behavioral_public_policy | Behavioral public policy]] is defined as the use of behavioral science evidence to inform policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. It assists governments and policymakers throughout the entire policy cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>:

*   **Problem Identification:** Helps identify and prioritize societal challenges where people's behavior is counter to their or society's long-term interests (e.g., unhealthy food choices, low program uptake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. It also aids in analyzing problems and understanding behavioral drivers and barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Policy Design:** Growing area where behavioral science evidence informs the design of policies to address identified barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Policy Assessment:** Provides tools like randomized controlled trials (RCTs), pilot testing, and other experimental methods to de-risk policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Policy Implementation:** The most traditional use, where behavioral science helps decide how a policy should be implemented, optimize existing programs, maximize impact, and ensure intended outcomes are realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Monitoring and Evaluation:** Supports monitoring implementation actions and evaluating policies to inform future problem identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## The "Logic" Framework: Five Dimensions, 14 Principles

The "Logic" framework is structured around five key dimensions, encompassing 14 good practice principles for [[behavioral_public_policy | mainstreaming behavioral public policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Leadership
This dimension focuses on the role and relationship of leaders in an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Principle 1: Senior leaders request and advocate for Behavioral Science.** When senior leaders advocate for a people-centered approach and robust evidence, the use of behavioral science increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. For example, the US federal government recently issued an executive order on applying social and behavioral sciences to federal policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Principle 2: Behavioral Science managers maintain senior leader support.** This is achieved through regular briefings and continuous engagement at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Objectives
This dimension is about the strategy and how the goals of a behavioral science function should be identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Principle 3: Strategic objectives are defined to apply Behavioral Science.** Defining these objectives helps governments deliver strategic goals by identifying where behavioral science is most useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Principle 4: Impact is monitored and assessed.** Regular monitoring ensures behavioral science tools are achieving their goals, as seen in the Netherlands, where a report on behavioral science use is submitted to Parliament every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Principle 5: Behavioral Science is used to design and improve internal organizational processes, rules, and incentives.** This is a growing area where countries turn inward to make public administration more effective, leading to better policy and program delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### Governance
This dimension refers to how behavioral science fits within the structure of an organization and the resources available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Principle 6: Senior leaders clearly allocate responsibility and establish lines of accountability for mainstreaming Behavioral Science.** This can involve a single executive or a team responsible for mainstreaming behavioral science across government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Principle 7: Senior leaders and managers mobilize sufficient resources.** Adequate resources ensure that policy advice is informed by relevant and reliable behavioral science evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

### Integration
This dimension focuses on creating an enabling environment for [[behavioral_public_policy | behavioral public policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Principle 8: Managers integrate Behavioral Science into standard guidelines and procedures for policy development, implementation, and evaluation.** This can involve creating templates that include behavioral science as part of the analysis process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Principle 9: Behavioral Science is applied responsibly, openly, and with high integrity standards.** This is crucial for building and maintaining trust with policymakers and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Upholding ethical and research standards is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Principle 10: A data infrastructure supports processes and structures for data collection and analysis.** This makes it easier to diagnose behavioral issues and evaluate policy options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Canada's behavioral science team in the Privy Council Office, for example, conducts ongoing research on climate change behaviors, enabling continuous problem identification and policy assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

### Capability
This dimension refers to the ability of the public administration to produce and use behavioral science expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   **Principle 11: Managers build policymakers' capability to apply Behavioral Science.** Behavioral science literacy should be built broadly across government, not just within dedicated units, so that all can identify and apply it where useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Principle 12: Policymakers can access expertise in Behavioral Science when needed.** Behavioral science units and managers should develop sustainable ways for policymakers to access more advanced techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Principle 13: Knowledge is brokered.** Managers ensure that behavioral science evidence is useful for policymaking through quality brokerage, turning experts into advisors rather than just researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
*   **Principle 14: Knowledge is shared.** Mechanisms for dissemination and knowledge sharing, such as networks of behavioral science experts and supporters, foster sustained buy-in and growth in the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

## Country Experiences and Lessons Learned

### Finland
Finland's journey began in 2013 with government collaborations and an intensive four-year period of experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. The widely reported basic income experiment in 2017 garnered significant interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. A key turning point was during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, when the government benchmarked international practices and launched a six-month pilot for behavioral science, which was well-received, particularly in communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

The Finnish team, based in the Prime Minister's office, grew from two to four people and is set to become five, with expanding projects across central government ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. Successful RCTs, like text messages to encourage voting, were widely reported and helped scale up efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
Factors supporting growth include:
*   A strong, dedicated team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.
*   Robust support from the Prime Minister's Office's Strategic Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.
*   The conviction that governments "can't afford not to use Behavioral Sciences" to achieve impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.
*   An approach that is ambitious yet humble, focusing on collaborative work rather than just advising, especially for complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

A key lesson learned is that building [[role_of_behavioral_science_in_government | behavioral science into government work]] takes significant time and resources, with no shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. Understanding the unique context, systems, and processes from within is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. The role of communications is also surprisingly large, requiring consistent effort to build trust and inform people about the team's work and how they can be involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. Working *with* civil servants, involving them in the process, is transformative beyond just providing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>.

### United Kingdom
The UK government established the first behavioral insights unit in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. An important early success was the "9 out of 10 people in your area paid their tax on time" trial at HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs), which quantified impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. This initial success benefited from strong political support from the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, and heads of the Civil Service and Tax Authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

A key turning point occurs when political support wanes or changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. The HMRC behavioral team found success by seeking "side streams" rather than always fighting for the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. They targeted areas with autonomy, senior champions, and access to data, like debt management, to build consistent programs of trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

Another significant turning point was the COVID-19 pandemic, where the HMRC behavioral team had a "thoroughgoing widespread input" into the Furlow scheme (wage subsidy program) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. This involved influencing the basic framing of the scheme (providing reassurance, not just financial support), designing human-centered guidance, and even anti-fraud measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. Factors enabling this impact included:
*   **Novelty:** A new scheme with no established norms, fostering openness to new ideas and less resistance from the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.
*   **Track Record:** The team's credibility, established through previous trials and relationships, allowed them to sit at the top policy table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.
*   **Senior Buy-in:** Key figures like Rishi Sunak (then Chancellor, now PM) were behaviorally astute and open to broader perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.
*   **Opportunism and Communication:** The team actively sought opportunities, knew the organization well, and had proactive, strong communicators who could simplify and convey value easily, especially during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.

A key lesson is the need for constant advocacy as people don't fully understand behavioral science or its benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. Another significant lesson is the challenge of maintaining subtlety in interventions when scaling them up within government organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. Carefully designed, human-centered interventions can lose their delicate insights when they enter the "machine" of training hundreds of staff and navigating bureaucratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>. Behavioral teams must consider whether their interventions are too "perfected" for systems not designed for such fine-tuning, or be prepared for continuous advocacy throughout multi-year implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.

### Brazil
Brazil's journey with [[behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] began with isolated experiences, followed by initiatives in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. At the federal level, the National School of Public Administration started regularly offering behavioral science courses in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. These initiatives were crucial in raising awareness and building critical mass within the federal administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

The major turning point occurred in 2023 with the establishment of CINCO, the first behavioral science unit in a new ministry focused on management and innovation in public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. This development is significant not only for Brazil but also for Latin America, fostering regional collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. The ministry's transversal mandate across public administration (e.g., procurement, human resources, digital services) aligns perfectly with CINCO's mission to improve public policy and citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. The new government structure initiated by Lula's inauguration in 2023, creating the first innovation ministry for public services in Brazil, provided the opportune moment for CINCO's establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.

Advocacy by experienced individuals who had used behavioral science in previous innovation labs, combined with the new ministry's mandate, enabled CINCO's creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. CINCO received special authority to recruit civil servants from diverse backgrounds (federal universities, regulatory agencies), resulting in a 15-member full-time team with varied expertise, crucial for their research, communication, and partnership projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. CINCO emphasizes working *with* policymakers, developing a sense of co-ownership for projects rather than simply acting as consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.

The strong innovation movement in Brazil and the desire of civil servants to solve public problems drive engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. Behavioral insights offer a new lens to address persistent challenges, such as mosquito-borne diseases like dengue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. Despite traditional campaigns failing, behavioral science provides a new possibility for solving problems that traditional methods cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

A key lesson is the importance of learning from those with more experience, as practical application involves dealing with non-technical and political issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>. Even without a large budget, building bridges and collaborating with diverse experts is essential, as many people are eager to work together to improve society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>.

## OECD's Ongoing Role

The OECD aims to use the "Logic" framework as a diagnostic tool to help governments analyze their capacity for [[application_of_behavioral_science | applied behavioral science]] and provide evidence-based recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>. Similar to its country reviews on public governance, the OECD can now conduct reviews on how countries organize and manage their use of behavioral science to improve policies, services, and internal administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.

These reviews will compare countries against global benchmarks and offer practical advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>, such as:
*   Setting up new behavioral science functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.
*   Transforming existing functions into more effective models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.
*   Refining or innovating established functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.

The "Logic" principles, agreed upon by the global community, will guide these assessments, evaluating maturity across dimensions like leadership, objectives, and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. This diagnostic approach allows for targeted improvements, recognizing that countries may excel in some areas while needing improvement in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>. The goal is to advance the [[international_collaboration_in_behavioral_policy | integration of behavioral science in public policy globally]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.

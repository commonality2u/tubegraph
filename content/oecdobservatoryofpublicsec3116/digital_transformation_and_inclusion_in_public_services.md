## The Human-Centric Approach

A strategic and consistent approach to supporting [[public sector innovation and digital transformation | innovation in public services]] is emerging worldwide, placing the human element and people at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This requires a cultural shift in how bureaucracies operate to ensure citizens are central to services, serving them during important life events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The OECD promotes recommendations on [[adapting_public_administration_for_digital_transformation | human-centric public administrative services]], focusing on best practices for re-shifting efforts to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

Digital transformation, including the rise of artificial intelligence, provides tremendous opportunities for more responsive, personalized, and proactive public services if managed responsibly and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Digital innovation is seen as an important factor in these studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Why Innovation is Essential for Inclusion

Innovation in public services is not merely optional; it is a requirement for nations committed to improving citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Innovation must be human-centered, ensuring services are efficient, inclusive, and transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. It's about being creative and doing things differently to solve real problems for real people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Innovation is crucial to address complex challenges like inequality, climate change, and [[digital transformation in government | digital transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. It is essential for building trust as the state addresses the needs of every citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

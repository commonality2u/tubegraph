[[Innovation in the public sector|Government innovation]] is crucial for delivering better value and adapting to the evolving needs of citizens and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Governments have not yet solved all the problems faced by their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Through changing their approaches, governments can become more impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, ultimately delivering new or better value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> and more impactful solutions to their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Adapting to a Changing World
The world is constantly changing around governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Many existing governmental systems, such as healthcare, welfare, and taxation, were designed in eras like the 1950s and no longer match the contemporary world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Responding to Digitalization
Today, citizens conduct many activities online and expect the same ease of experience when interacting with government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The massive digitalization occurring globally necessitates that governments respond to this change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. [[Impact of technological disruption on government innovation|Technological disruption]] and the rise of digital usage mean governments must [[role_of_adaptive_innovation_in_government_services | adapt to new systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Meeting Evolving Societal Needs
Beyond technology, people's needs are also changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Societies do not live their lives the same way they did in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Therefore, governments must innovate to respond to these new needs that arise from changing societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## [[Anticipatory innovation for governments|Anticipating Future Challenges]]
Governments also need to look forward and prepare for fundamental changes and [[challenges_requiring_government_innovation|challenges]] that lie ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The world faces complex challenges and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, such as:
*   Climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Aging populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   The emergence of new types of societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

To be ready for tomorrow, governments require different kinds of thinking and innovation to anticipate the future itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This ensures that fundamental future changes do not negatively impact how governments function, and more importantly, how people function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

In summary, the [[importance_of_government_involvement_in_innovation|importance of government innovation]] stems from the need to:
1.  Deliver more impactful solutions and greater value to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
2.  Adapt to a rapidly changing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
3.  Anticipate future challenges and changes that will fundamentally alter societal functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

Governments must innovate to address current and future challenges, ensuring they remain impactful and relevant in a rapidly evolving world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This drive for [[Innovation Strategies for Governments | innovation]] stems from three primary reasons:

## 1. Addressing Unsolved Problems and Enhancing Impact

Governments have not yet solved all the problems faced by their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. To become more impactful, governments need to innovate by changing their approaches to deliver new or better value for their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The goal is to achieve more impactful solutions for public benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## 2. Adapting to a Changing World

The world itself is constantly changing around governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Many existing government systems, such as healthcare, welfare, and taxation, were designed in the 1950s and no longer match the realities of today's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Key aspects of this changing environment include:
*   **Digitalization**: Modern society operates predominantly online, and citizens expect the same ease of experience when interacting with government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Evolving Needs**: People's needs are changing as societies evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Governments must respond to the emergence of new systems like digital technology, as well as the new needs that come with changing societal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Therefore, governments must [[role_of_adaptive_innovation_in_government_services | adapt]] to these shifts and change with the environment around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## 3. Anticipating Future Fundamental Challenges

Beyond current problems and evolving environments, governments must also look forward and prepare for fundamental changes and [[challenges_requiring_government_innovation | challenges]] that lie ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The future is marked by complex challenges and inherent uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Examples of these include:
*   Climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Aging populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Emergence of new types of societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

To address these, governments must prepare for the future and [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipate]] what is to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This requires [[Anticipatory Innovation in the Public Sector | innovation]] and a different kind of thinking today to be ready for tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. [[Strategic foresight and innovation in government | Anticipating the future]] is crucial for dealing with changes that will fundamentally alter how governments and people function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

In summary, [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | government innovation]] is essential to deliver more impactful solutions, adapt to ongoing changes in the world, and proactively anticipate future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

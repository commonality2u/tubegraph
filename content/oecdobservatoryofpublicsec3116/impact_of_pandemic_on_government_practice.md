The "Government After Shock Round Table" convened to discuss what the pandemic reveals about the practice of government and its future direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The discussion aimed to reflect on what has worked, what has not, and what might be missing in current governance approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The session explored governments' self-discoveries and ongoing learning processes as the [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | pandemic's impact]] continues to manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Key Revelations and Priority Areas

Panelists from Georgia, Slovenia, South Africa, and Portugal shared their initial insights:

*   **Georgia:** The pandemic served as a significant test for existing government policies, revealing their alignment with national priorities and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Priorities such as [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_transformation_in_the_public_sector | digitalization of e-services]], e-governance development, strengthening local authorities, decentralization, supporting small businesses, promoting local production, and [[impact_of the_pandemic_on_health_systems | Universal Health Care investments]] proved effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Coordinated efforts across government and public administration significantly contributed to managing the first wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Slovenia:** The crisis presented an opportunity to learn about the system, its purpose, actions, and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. A survey of civil servants revealed that 45% found their efficiency higher while teleworking, and 31% maintained the same efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **South Africa:** Developing countries demonstrated rapid [[covid19_responses_and_government_adaptability | responses]] despite limited resources, with Africa reporting relatively low case and death numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The pandemic highlighted the importance of decisive leadership, appropriate responses, research, and evidence-based decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. It also underscored the need for consultation, transparency, and accountability to rebuild trust and legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. However, it also exposed global inequalities, increased unemployment, weakened economies, absence of relevant policies, and fragility of [[impact_of the_pandemic_on_health_systems | health systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Portugal:** Investments in [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]], simplification, [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_transformation_in_the_public_sector | digitalization]], and civic participation allowed for quick reaction and implementation of measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Around 70% of public workers transitioned to remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. The crisis confirmed the responsible nature and strong public duty of public administration professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Government Speed and Agility

The crisis highlighted instances of rapid government action alongside slower responses.
*   **Slovenia:** Rapid, informed, and coordinated decisions were crucial, requiring a different approach than usual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. The spring period served as a stress test for state administration processes and civil servant competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Agility requires internal debureaucratization and greater responsibility for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. The presence of trust among individuals, teams, and authorities is key to enabling self-organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

The workplace was redefined, with frontline and essential service workers going to work while others worked remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. Structures for [[covid19_responses_and_government_adaptability | COVID-19 response]] were formed even before the first case was announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. The lockdown, announced on March 28th, provided time to plan and delay the infection peak, particularly for [[impact_of the_pandemic_on_health_systems | health services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:26:02]</a>. The pandemic accelerated the building of field hospitals and fostered collaboration with the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. Speedy procurement decisions for personal protective equipment (PPE) sometimes led to corruption issues, which were subsequently addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
*   **Portugal:** Acting quickly with limited information proved challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. Collaboration was key to balancing agility and thoroughness, particularly with citizens/civil society, among public sector organizations (sharing knowledge, data, technology), and between countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. Long-standing investments in [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_transformation_in_the_public_sector | digitalization]] through programs like "Simplex" allowed for rapid, large-scale implementation of services like electronic prescriptions, pre-filled tax declarations, and homeschooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. Within the first weeks of the crisis, public administration implemented around 200 simplification projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.

## Trust and Citizen Engagement

The level of [[impact_of_covid19_on_governmentcitizen_relationships | citizen trust]] in government significantly influenced the implementation of policies, especially confinement strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.
*   **South Africa:** Clear and consistent communication from the highest offices, such as the Minister of Health and the President, fostered trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. This trust led to widespread public compliance with measures like mask-wearing and lockdown regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.
*   **Portugal:** Trust is the cornerstone of governance models and democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. A massive communication campaign, including a "we are on" motto, online websites, and apps, provided accessible information to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. The [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_transformation_in_the_public_sector | digital transformation]] of public service is human-centered, involving citizens in choices regarding measures and digital tools, fostering collective decision-making and ensuring fundamental rights in the digital world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.
*   **Georgia:** Trust and consolidation of society were key to Georgia's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. The government's transparent communication, including sharing difficult information and educating the public with specialists, built confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. The willingness to admit mistakes and make corrective actions based on public feedback contributed to a participatory approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
*   **Slovenia:** Trust is extremely important for leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>. Fake news posed a challenge to trust in Slovenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>. Involving experts like doctors and epidemiologists instead of "bureaucrats" is key to gaining trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

## Interconnectedness and Policy Complexity

The crisis clearly showcased the interconnected and complex nature of global issues, linking health with social and economic situations, and highlighting immediate international consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
*   **Georgia:** The country's open economy, relying on trade and tourism, was significantly impacted by border closures and disrupted logistical chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. Efforts were made to promote internal tourism and provide anti-crisis packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>. The crisis revealed new opportunities for development, such as attracting foreign direct investments (FDIs) with special packages for businesses to relocate to Georgia, and promoting long-term visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>. The situation also highlighted opportunities for growth in agriculture and IT sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.
*   **Portugal:** The crisis underlined the need for a comprehensive and holistic "whole of government" approach to policy-making, especially when addressing global agendas like the 2030 SDGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>. A roadmap for [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] and modernization of the state and public administration focuses on four interconnected axes: investing in people and their skills, developing management capacity through simplification and collaborative work models, exploring technology for enhanced operations, and reinforcing proximity to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.
*   **South Africa:** Working together with evidence-based planning and monitoring is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. While decentralization promotes accountability, it can also embed siloed approaches, necessitating inter-governmental collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. The country focused on growing the economy, tourism, and reversing the negative impact on the aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a>.

*   **Sustainability of Improvements:** Many policy changes and actions, such as remote working, are expected to be sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. They have opened new perspectives for development in education, social policies, and various economic sectors, including tourism and real estate, prompting them to become more stress-resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.
*   **Higher Citizen Expectations:** Citizens now expect more explanations, communication, and proactive actions from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. This increases their involvement and participation, setting higher standards for public administration in competence, responsibility, openness, transparency, and participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation:** The [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_transformation_in_the_public_sector | digital transformation]] in the public sector is expected to continue and be further improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. Remote work, initially met with opposition, became preferred by civil servants who now wish to combine it with office work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. This marks a "revolution" in how public services are used and offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.
*   **Changes in Public Governance System:**
    *   **South Africa:** Online conferences and hybrid parliamentary sittings are sustainable changes, improving efficiency for ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. Further legislative amendments might be needed for other changes to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.
    *   **Portugal:** The focus is on a human-centered [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_transformation_in_the_public_sector | digital transformation]] of the public sector, driven by people's choices and ethical use of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>. The goal is to emerge with greater social cohesion and a greener, stronger economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.
    *   **Slovenia:** Key changes include greater empowerment for civil servants to self-organize and be more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. Governments must enable continuous education and attract/retain talent, fostering cooperation between young and experienced civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>.
    *   **Georgia:** The three keywords for change are government and public consolidation, government efficiency, and [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. A major challenge is adapting to the "new normal," inspiring and motivating public administration in a remote mode while maintaining efficiency and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:24">[01:14:24]</a>.

The crisis is viewed as a major opportunity for the renovation of democracy, policymaking, and service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>. Key takeaways include the importance of a human-centered, digital, and ethical public service, greater empowerment of civil servants, investment in technology, research, and [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]], and overall government consolidation and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>.

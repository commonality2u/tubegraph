Inequality has emerged as a significant public policy issue in recent years, with the COVID-19 crisis further highlighting the urgent need to address disparities [00:41:58]. Crises inherently affect people differently, often exacerbating existing inequalities [00:42:49].

## The Impact of Crises on Public Administration and Inequality

Decades of crises, including the financial crisis, sovereign crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic, have significantly eroded public administration capacities in many countries and regions [00:03:45]. This weakening of public administration has limited its ability to be renewed, improved, and trained, leading to a loss of experienced civil servants through retirement [00:03:59]. This situation is particularly critical for weaker regions, hindering their capacity to catch up and achieve a more resilient and sustainable path [00:06:33].

## Addressing Inequality Through Public Policy

Responding to increased inequalities and ensuring better outcomes for all requires a re-evaluation of public governance tools [00:43:02]. Governments are now faced with the dual challenge of a weakened public administration and new imperatives for recovery, focused on digital transformation, greening, and a more cohesive approach [00:05:00].

### Leveraging New Opportunities

New funding and technical support instruments, such as the European Union's Technical Support Instrument and Recovery and Resilience Plans, present a significant opportunity to reshape and reorganize civil services and institutional capacities [00:05:24]. These resources can be used to modernize public administration, but must be carefully managed to avoid creating new divides [00:34:45].

### Avoiding the Digital Divide

While digital transformation is central to future public policy, there is a crucial need to prevent a "digital divide" [00:35:31]. Concentrating public administration into a digital framework without careful planning risks leaving segments of the population—due to geographical location, capacities, or educational capabilities—cut off from basic public services [00:35:36]. To mitigate this, a place-based, bottom-up approach is necessary to ensure digital opportunities do not [[impact_of_inequality_on_access_to_government_services | increase regional and social divides]] [00:36:27].

### Promoting Inclusion and Equality

Efforts to promote [[equity_and_accessibility_in_public_service_delivery | equality and inclusion]] in public service delivery are vital:
*   **Systematic Approaches to Diverse Perspectives**: Countries need to integrate systematic approaches to gather diverse perspectives in decision-making [00:43:55]. An example is the Netherlands' "generation check," which evaluates the impact of policies across generations [00:44:01].
*   **Inclusive Policy Design**: Deliberately integrating [[inclusive_services_and_public_policy_making | inclusive policy design]] can lead to better policies for all and increase [[trust_and_transparency_in_public_policy | trust in government]] [00:25:04].
*   **Addressing Vulnerable Groups**: Public administration must ensure that "minority parts of our society" are sufficiently cared for [00:51:26]. This includes considering gender equality (e.g., gender-sensitive and inclusive recovery, employment gender gap) [00:52:02], age differences (care for elderly and young people) [00:52:36], and ensuring that generational gaps, geographical location, and social belonging do not dictate access to public services [00:53:17].

### Lessons from the Pandemic for Future Governance

The pandemic has accelerated trends and highlighted the need for fundamental shifts in governance:
*   **Whole-of-Government Approach**: Governments must operate in a horizontal, "whole-of-government" manner, overcoming silos between programs, budgets, and organizational structures [00:17:01]. This requires the right skills and capabilities at the center of government for coordination [00:17:31].
*   **Vertical Optimization and Feedback Mechanisms**: Historically, the focus has been on top-down compliance. The future requires listening and creating feedback mechanisms so that front-line issues are available to senior leadership [00:18:00].
*   **Adaptive Policymaking**: Policymaking and implementation routines need to be constantly adapted based on the experiences of the workforce, managers, and the people served [00:19:42]. Annual review cycles are insufficient for the pace of change required [00:20:06].
*   **International Cooperation**: Global challenges necessitate cross-border collaboration and partnerships, as problems no longer respect organizational boundaries [00:20:28].

### Commitment to a Better Future

Despite concerns that governments might not take concrete action post-crisis [00:26:46], there is a strong commitment from the public and within organizations to implement learned lessons [00:25:59]. The COVID-19 recovery provides a unique opportunity to redefine public policy and transform government action, organization, and operations to avoid returning to the "old normal" [00:59:46]. This involves shaping a future with equal opportunities for everyone, leveraging digital transformation, and addressing deep-rooted inequalities for a more sustainable, equitable, and resilient future [01:00:01].

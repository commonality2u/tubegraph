Innovation is inherently difficult to define, as it concerns novelties and things that previously did not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While the private sector provides a clearer framework for understanding innovation, its application in the public sector presents unique complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Defining Innovation in Context

In the private sector, innovation is typically understood as something new that is implemented within a market context to gain a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This can manifest as a new service, process, product, or any novel thinking applied to achieve a direct market proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

However, the concept of [[innovation in the public sector]] is more complicated due to the absence of a market feedback system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. [[Innovation in Public Sector]] should be defined by its novelty, meaning it introduces things that are new to a specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Crucially, these new ideas, services, or processes must be implemented and applied to have an actual impact, rather than just being inventions or theoretical discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Innovation and Public Value

Unlike the private sector where competitive advantage is a key driver, [[innovation in the public sector]] cannot rely on this metric because the government is typically the sole player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Instead, the focus shifts to contributing to a "change in public value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This refers to the new things that the innovation has contributed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Dual Nature of Impact

The impact of innovation on public value is not always uniformly positive or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

For example:
*   **Positive Impact:** Digital advancements can lead to services being delivered more quickly to different people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Negative Impact:** The same digital innovation might exclude a certain segment of the population if they lack access to digital tools or the capability to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

> [!INFO]
> [[Innovation in the public sector]] can therefore be both beneficial and detrimental, but it fundamentally involves new things that are implemented in a new context to bring some form of value to the population that uses them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

[[Behavioral insights]] involve analyzing and observing real behaviors to inform and design more effective public policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:10">[09:09:10]</a>. This approach shifts focus from ad-hoc measures to a context-dependent, risk-based strategy to fighting corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:18">[08:15:18]</a>. The application of [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights]] in public integrity is a growing area of interest among OECD member countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:29">[14:27:29]</a>.

## The OECD's Approach to Public Integrity

The OECD's Recommendation on Public Integrity, launched in 2017, provides policymakers with a strategic approach to combatting corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:06">[08:04:06]</a>. This recommendation emphasizes cultivating a culture of integrity across society, involving not only public servants but also businesses, civil society organizations, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:35">[08:33:35]</a>.

A foundational report, "Behavioral Insights for Public Integrity," was launched by the OECD in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. This report reviews findings from [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] and provides specific lessons for the public integrity field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:40">[09:40:40]</a>.

[[Behavioral insights]] are considered crucial for anti-corruption and integrity measures, influencing two primary policy areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>:
1.  **Supporting ethical choices**: While assumptions often suggest people act corruptly when benefits outweigh costs, experimental research shows most individuals have a moral compass guiding their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. The challenge is that people may still act unethically but find justifications, leading to a need to empower public officials and create an environment that supports ethical choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Ensuring effective [[implementing_behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | implementation of integrity policies]]**: Policies often fail to achieve desired impact or even backfire due to a lack of consideration for the real behaviors of public officials during implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.

## The Slovakia Project: Applying Behavioral Insights to Corruption Prevention

The OECD, in partnership with Slovak institutions (including the anti-corruption prevention department and the government office), conducted a four-year project to improve capacities in the Slovak public administration and reinforce integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This project included analytical work and concrete tools for civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

The project focused on four areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>:
1.  Incorporating a strategic approach to inform integrity policies, under the National Anti-Corruption Policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
2.  Improving horizontal coordination across integrity functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
3.  Engaging the whole of society in integrity efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
4.  Applying a behavioral risk-based approach to corruption prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This last area is crucial for mitigating risks and strengthening accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

An Integrity Review of the Slovak Republic, published in 2022, provided a 360-degree view of the Slovak integrity system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. It found that while measures were in place for corruption risk management, their application was lagging, a challenge shared across many OECD countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

### The BASIC Framework

The project utilized the **BASIC framework**, a 5-step process for applied [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]], developed by the OECD in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>:
1.  **B**ehavior: Understand the target behavior and determine if [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] is suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.
2.  **A**nalysis: Investigate why the behavior occurs, considering context and social norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.
3.  **S**trategy: Identify [[behavioral insights and gamification | behavioral strategies]] to counter identified biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>.
4.  **I**ntervention: Empirically test interventions in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.
5.  **C**hange: Scale up successful interventions to create lasting change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.

## Experiment Design and Findings

The experiment aimed to prevent corruption in the Slovak public administration by empowering public sector employees to detect and report corruption risks safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

### Identified Behavioral Barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>
Through focus groups and interviews with anti-corruption coordinators and public officials, several recurring behaviors were identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:24]</a>:
*   **"Ticking the box" behavior by managers**: Formally complying but not acting in line with conduct codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
*   **Misreporting**: Managers reporting progress they hadn't made to meet European obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>.
*   **Underutilization of electronic survey**: An existing channel for reporting corruption risks was not encouraged by managers or widely used by employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.
*   **Employees not speaking up about corruption risks**: A pervasive "culture of fear" and "silence" prevented reporting, especially for *potential* risks rather than just incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.

The experiment focused on the issue of employees not speaking up about corruption risks due to its transversal nature across administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. Drivers for this behavior included:
*   Lack of good examples from leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.
*   Limited understanding of reporting channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.
*   Psychological costs, such as fear of retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.
*   Managers downplaying risks or not providing feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:34:00">[22:34:00]</a>.

### Experiment Design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>
A randomized vignette experiment was conducted to increase risk communication. Public officials were randomized into three groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:00">[25:16:00]</a>:
1.  **Control Group**: Received no intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>.
2.  **Treatment Group 1 (Understanding Risk)**: Received a message providing an analogy (health risk) to improve understanding of corruption risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>.
3.  **Treatment Group 2 (Exemplary Leadership)**: Received a message appealing to the concept of exemplary leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a>.

Both treatment messages also included an injunctive social norm, reminding that "every civil servant should be honest and speak about corruption risks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>.

A total of 2,537 respondents from various line ministries and central authorities participated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:33:00">[30:33:00]</a>. To encourage participation, a lottery offered three participants a 15-minute chat with the Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>.

### Results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:22:00">[31:22:00]</a>
*   **Control Group**: 48% of respondents were likely to communicate a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47:00">[31:47:00]</a>.
*   **Exemplary Leadership Message**: Employees were approximately **14 percentage points more likely** to communicate a risk compared to the control group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:00">[33:27:00]</a>. This was the most impactful message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39:00">[33:39:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding Risk Message**: Employees were approximately **9 percentage points more likely** to communicate a risk compared to the control group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[33:42:00]</a>.

[!NOTE]
The experiment demonstrated that [[impact_of_insights_on_public_policy | behavioral insights]] could increase integrity among public officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:56:00">[33:56:00]</a>.

### Secondary Findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>
*   **Age and Reporting**: Younger respondents were more likely to communicate a corruption risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>. An increase in age by one year decreased the likelihood by 0.23 percentage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:00">[34:27:00]</a>. This may be due to a greater fear of retaliation among senior staff and a status quo bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.
*   **Career Length**: Career length in public administration did not correlate with the likelihood of communicating a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>.
*   **Feeling of Safety**: Asking respondents whom they would report to (manager, HR, anti-corruption coordinator) generally increased their feeling of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[01:13:02]</a>. The treatments had a small positive effect on safety (around 3 percentage points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>. The majority preferred communicating risks to their managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[01:12:12]</a>. Senior respondents were less likely to feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:19:00">[36:19:00]</a>.
*   **Trust in the System**: Trust in the risk management system correlated with feeling safe and the likelihood to communicate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:00">[36:58:00]</a>. However, the treatments did not improve the *understanding* of what constitutes a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:02:00">[38:02:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways and Recommendations for [[Behavioral Public Policy]]

Based on the findings, three main axes of work are recommended for Slovakia's new National Anti-Corruption Strategy (2024-2029) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>:

1.  **Empower Leaders to Set the Standard**:
    *   Since leadership messages were most effective, provide training and resources for leaders to act with integrity and lead by example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:28:00">[39:28:00]</a>.
    *   Anti-corruption coordinators also have a key [[role of behavioral science in government | role in government]] in setting an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:52:00">[39:52:00]</a>.

2.  **Make Risk Communication Easy and Well Understood**:
    *   Design policies that align with employee preferences, such as reporting to managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:44:00">[40:44:00]</a>.
    *   Raise awareness of existing reporting channels (e.g., electronic surveys) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:02:00">[41:02:00]</a>.
    *   Implement clear, concise, and behaviorally informed guidelines for reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[41:10:00]</a>.

3.  **Cultivate a Culture of Safety**:
    *   Feelings of safety are a key enabler for people to speak up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>. Efforts should focus on making speaking up a social norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:47:00">[41:47:00]</a>.

## Expert Commentary

Experts noted the ambitious nature of the study, given the sensitive topic of corruption and the direct targeting of the relevant population (public officials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

*   **Rigorous Methodology**: The use of vignettes and randomized assignments is a rigorous way to establish causal connections between interventions and outcomes, mitigating social desirability bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.
*   **Magnitude of Effects**: The observed magnitude of change (e.g., from 48% to 62% reporting) by changing a few words demonstrates the power of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral public policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.
*   **Importance of Beliefs**: Understanding civil servants' beliefs about leaders' expectations and co-workers' actions could provide further insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. The concept of "trust" (believing the system works) aligns with "group efficacy" – the belief in one's power to be an agent of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>.
*   **Scaling Up**: Any policy must be tested repeatedly before scaling up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. Future work could involve real-world experiments in multiple public administrations, testing different reporting channels or training impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. Spillovers between different offices should be considered in scaled-up tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>.
*   **Analogies**: The use of analogies (like health risks) is crucial for helping people understand abstract concepts like corruption risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>.
*   **Safety as Key**: People generally want to report, but fear of retaliation and the perception that "ticking the box" by managers will drain power prevents them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Ensuring feelings of safety is vital for contributing to the collective good of integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>.
*   **Age-related trends**: The finding that younger participants are more likely to report aligns with observations of changing risk aversion over time and possibly greater exposure to broader communication about ethics across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>. The concept of what is "normal" or ethical can also change across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Approach**: While the experiment focused on risk communication, it is part of a broader effort to strengthen the entire corruption risk management system, including the design of mitigation measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:19">[01:24:19]</a>.

[!TIP]
Future efforts could explore changing the social status of those who speak up, making it a positive act for the collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. Education on integrity, starting from universities or high school, could also help people understand concepts like integrity and risk management earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:23">[01:28:23]</a>.

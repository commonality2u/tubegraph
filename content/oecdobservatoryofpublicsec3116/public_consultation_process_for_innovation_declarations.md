The Public Consultation Process for the draft declaration on [[public_sector_innovation_declarations | public sector innovation]] is being managed by Rebecca Santos, an advisor with the Secretary of [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | Public Sector Innovation]] at the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This process aims to gather feedback on the draft declaration, which seeks to build common agreement at the international level regarding [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

## Purpose of the Consultation

The consultation process allows for an informal discussion to understand countries' [[experiences_of_france_and_canada_with_innovation_declarations | experiences with declarations]], how they originated, and how they have been used to spur [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The OECD's draft declaration is underpinned by ideas that aim to make it a useful tool for countries moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

This [[public_sector_innovation_declarations | declaration]] is an attempt to achieve common agreement internationally and is based on work with various countries, including detailed work with the Public Service of Canada on its [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | public sector innovation]] system study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. The goal is to facilitate a more sophisticated conversation about [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]], recognizing its multifaceted nature and the need to build an accessible language around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

## Key Themes Underpinning the Declaration

The declaration attempts to codify language and tell a richer story about why [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] matters, why governments should support it, and how all public servants can play a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. It emphasizes:
*   Embracing and enhancing [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] already occurring within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   Equipping all public servants to play their role in [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
*   The importance of [[engaging_stakeholders_in_innovation | new partnerships and diverse perspectives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
*   Recognizing [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] as a continually evolving practice that requires learning and sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

The declaration promotes a portfolio approach to [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]], encouraging governments to hedge their bets by maintaining [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] across various "facets" to be ready for challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>:
*   **Enhancement-oriented [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]]**: Improving existing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]]**: Achieving ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Adaptive [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]]**: Responding to a changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.
*   **[[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory innovation]]**: Engaging with weak signals early to shape change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

## Consultation Details and Desired Feedback

The public consultation process opened in November 2018, when the draft declaration was launched at an OECD conference in Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. It is set to conclude on February 22, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

Contributions are welcome from individuals, organizations, particular groups, or on behalf of a country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. The OECD welcomes feedback from anyone working in or alongside government, including the community and academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>.

Useful contributions include:
*   **Clarity and Wording**: Feedback on what does or does not make sense, especially concerning directives and proposed actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. For example, some feedback indicated that terms like "weak signals" were not immediately understood and needed further explanation or simpler language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.
*   **Language Suggestions**: Guidance on terminology that might mean something different in various cultural contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. An example given was the distinction between "civil servant" and "public servant" in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   **Practicality of Actions**: Input on whether proposed actions or activities are useful or impossible in a given context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. For instance, feedback highlighted the need to stress that "failure is part of an experimentation" as a distinct activity for auditing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.
*   **Implications**: Information about possible implications a directive or activity might have in a specific country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

The consultation process aims to iterate the draft to make it the best and strongest document possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

## Scope and Impact

While the OECD primarily engages with national governments, comments from local governments and local [[engaging_stakeholders_in_innovation | innovation ecosystems]] are highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | Innovation]] must be considered from an ecosystem perspective, recognizing that no single level of government or body can address all issues or innovate successfully alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. Local bodies can also affirm their commitment to the declaration independently, signaling support to their stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

### Nature of the Declaration
The declaration is intended to be an official OECD instrument but is **not legally binding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. Member countries can affirm their commitment to its ideals, but they will not be strictly measured against its requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. Signing on would signal the importance of [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] within a government and provide a framework of good ideas and directives to inform [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. It serves as a starting point for governments to develop and maintain a portfolio approach to [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

### Citizen Participation
[[engaging_stakeholders_in_innovation | Citizen participation]] is considered a crucial part of an effective [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | public sector innovation]] process, relying on understanding different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. The declaration talks about the involvement of [[engaging_stakeholders_in_innovation | new partnerships and diverse perspectives]], and the OECD encourages governments to seek and listen to different voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.

### Leadership and Skills for Innovation
The OECD is also conducting ongoing work on leadership and skills required for [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]], exploring the mindsets and capabilities needed to develop [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] competency within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. Different forms of leadership and specific [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] skills are needed at various stages of the [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] process, from problem understanding to implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. This work acknowledges the need for an [[engaging_stakeholders_in_innovation | ecosystem]] of diverse players in the [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

## Next Steps
After the public consultation closes on February 22nd, the feedback will be used to iterate the draft declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. Following this, it will be proposed to the Public Governance Committee within the OECD for further consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

Additional information, including a summary of advice for contributions and links to the Canadian Declaration and French Manifesto, will be shared via a blog and email to registrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Questions can be directed to `opsi@oecd.org` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has provided a new impetus to [[public_sector_innovation_and_government_transformation | innovation practice]] globally, heightening its sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This period has prompted reflection on the evolving nature of [[public_sector_innovation_and_government_transformation | public sector innovation]] and what governments can anticipate in the future, particularly how to push conventional boundaries for lasting [[public_administration_transformation | transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Challenges Faced by the Public Sector

One of the significant learnings from the pandemic is the public sector's struggle to truly listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Decision-making has often been based on an outdated idea that governments inherently know what to do, announce it, and people will follow â€“ a notion that has proven to be a fallacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Current mechanisms for listening are inadequate, highlighting the immaturity of participative democracy and the limited spaces for collaboration and discussion, which allows power to be quickly assumed by a few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The crisis revealed flawed assumptions about people's lives, leading to damage from how individuals were spoken about, or not at all, and a lack of understanding of the impact on care homes, schools, and jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Public systems often lack empathy, compassion, and are not optimized for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Governments are asking people to trust systems that have historically treated them unequally and let them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Prior to the crisis, national governments often struggled with policymaking, which tended to be too scattergun in trying to influence complex systems and too path-dependent, lacking agility for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. The "new public management" model, described as a "massive Global failed experiment," was deemed "dead" but still influential due to a lack of clear alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. Public sectors also often faced frustrations internally, not fully utilizing the capacities of their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

## Emergent Transformations and Opportunities

The pandemic has accelerated changes and offered glimpses of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Key opportunities and shifts include:

*   **Radical Listening and Collaboration**: When listening is done well, trust and relationships can flourish, leading to positive outcomes even in dire circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Communities have created spaces to be heard, leading to faster, better feedback loops and enabling those previously excluded to engage with government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure Investment**: Governments with prior investments in basic infrastructure, like health protocols (e.g., building on SARS and Ebola experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>) or [[public_sector_digital_transformation | digital safety nets]], had more options to improvise and innovate during the emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Physical infrastructure, such as India repurposing railway cars as ambulances, also demonstrated creative reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Shaking Complacency**: The observation that some developing countries coped better than developed ones is expected to shake complacency in advanced public service and policymaking systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **Functional Redundancy**: The crisis highlighted the importance of having systems that are not operating at 100% capacity, allowing for resilience during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **Agile Policymaking**: Policies were made and enacted more quickly than previously thought possible, accelerating a shift towards a policy mindset of "thinking like a system, acting like an entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **[[public_sector_digital_transformation | Digital Levelling Up]] and Relational Models**: There has been a massive leveling up in [[public_sector_digital_transformation | digital public services]], a growth in analytical skills, and a recognition of the importance of targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. Concurrently, the inadequacy of transactional public service models was exposed, highlighting the importance of moving towards a relational model where public services are outcomes of collaboration between state, citizen, and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
*   **Expanded Policy Options**: Policy choices previously deemed unacceptable, like social distancing, free childcare, mobile apps with privacy concerns, universal basic income, and labor market subsidies, have been broadly tolerated or welcomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **Fluid Social Contract**: The social contract is currently fluid, with citizens and the state building new "muscles" in their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. This newfound capacity can be deployed for future crises like [[climate_change | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
*   **Challenging Financial Orthodoxies**: The crisis demonstrated that artificial constraints on public spending exist, and governments found "hundreds of billions of dollars" of loose change, challenging previous orthodoxies around public finance and what can be afforded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>.
*   **Liberating Talent**: The crisis projected individuals from lower ranks into important tasks due to their unique skills (e.g., digital expertise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. There's a much higher tone of reflectivity, with emergency reconnecting people to why they joined civil service and reducing the distance between planners/service delivery and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. Organizations have opened up, willing to take insight from different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.

## Conditions for Lasting Change

For lasting [[public_administration_transformation | transformation]], several conditions are critical:

*   **Political Will and Coalitions**: The future depends on whether new policy mindsets and relational models can be combined and whether political coalitions are strong enough to grasp the opportunity when policymakers' minds are open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. This includes the ability of progressive movements to put together a coherent case for public service reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>.
*   **Experimentation and Learning**: Continued experimentation and [[public_sector_innovation_and_government_transformation | innovation]], particularly in cities, which are seen as a fertile scale for change, will accelerate learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.
*   **Private Sector Role**: The private sector, which contributed to the "disaster of new public management" by selling ineffective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>, now has a chance to engage responsibly, not just seeking contracts but fostering genuine collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.
*   **Facing Undeniable Truths**: Despite potential desires to revert to old incentive structures, the undeniable truths of complexity, growing problems (e.g., poverty, social injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>), and the exposed weaknesses in public services will necessitate new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.
*   **Evolving Leadership**: Leadership needs to shift from being focused on "doing things" to "being something," connecting workforces to values, behaviors, and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>. Leaders must be inspirational, driving change and making public service attractive for new talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>. The role of hierarchy in a post-COVID world is being questioned, as organizations have worked in flatter ways, yet difficult decisions still require leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   **New Narratives**: A new narrative for success is crucial, moving beyond merely low case numbers to more cohesive societies where marginalized communities are included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

## Advice for Institutions

Institutions like the OECD should:
*   Invest less in "content" and more in "relationships," fostering networks and enabling people to spend time together to strengthen connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.
*   Use their platform to advocate for "next-generation governance," decision-making, and public sector management, helping countries shift from "zombie orthodoxies" that are "well past their prime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>.
*   Call for fundamental investments in capacity and infrastructure, such as universal healthcare and Universal Basic Income (UBI), seeing this as a moment to push for these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   Take the lead in articulating the needed paradigm shift and include new and different voices in this conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic presents "plastic hours" â€“ crucial moments in history where an otherwise rigid social order becomes pliable, allowing for action, hope, and fundamental change if harnessed effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>.

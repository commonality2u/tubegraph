The concept of innovation portfolios, particularly in the public sector, often highlights the necessity of [[collaboration and public sector partnerships | collaboration]] across various sectors and at multiple levels to drive significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>. Traditional approaches to policy and [[public_sector_innovation_and_collaboration | innovation projects]] often involve layered efforts that are not systematically viewed or managed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This segmented approach makes it difficult to understand the combined outcomes and synergies of various initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Drivers for Collaboration
The drive towards a portfolio approach recognizes that [[the_role_of_public_sector_in_innovation | public sector innovation]] must solve problems and adapt to environmental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This requires managing diverse types of innovation (e.g., mission-oriented, adaptive, anticipatory, enhancement-oriented) in effective and systemic ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. A key question is whether these different innovations can effectively coexist within the same portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Challenges to Collaboration
Despite the recognized need for [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaboration]], large organizations frequently face challenges with silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. Addressing this often implies radical organizational change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.

## Approaches to Fostering Partnerships

### Systemic Approach and Ground-Up Engagement
Innovation agencies, such as Vinnova, actively work to align top-down policy with bottom-up activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:04">[02:37:04]</a>. This involves fostering [[intergovernmental_and_crosssectoral_collaboration | cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral, multi-level relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Vinnova's approach involves:
*   **Co-design and Participation** Using co-design workshops, like those building "systems canvases," agencies engage hundreds of organizations and individuals, including citizens, startups, large corporations, and government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This allows for direct insight into actionable solutions and builds a network of committed stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Reality, Not Just Organization** By organizing efforts around real-world "objects" or problem areas (e.g., streets, schools, farms, forests), rather than internal governmental structures, multiple actors can be brought together where their interests collide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This approach aims to open up processes that were traditionally opaque and centrally controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Shifting from Funder to Engaged Actor** Rather than merely providing funding, agencies become deeply engaged in the ground-level work, fostering participation and working with platforms and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This can reduce traditional biases often associated with financial incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Ecosystem Approach for Transformative Change
Climate-KIC, a pan-European EU-funded innovation agency, emphasizes [[publicprivate_partnerships_for_innovation | collaboration]] with a wide community of partner organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. To address the climate emergency, they advocate for transformative change through innovation, moving beyond incremental, single-point solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Key aspects of their approach include:
*   **Demand-Driven Innovation** Shifting focus to understanding market challenges and needs, and applying innovation within systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This involves making deliberate choices about work from a portfolio perspective, considering the sum of the whole, interactions, and complementarity of activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Collective Intelligence** Using collective intelligence in decision-making and sense-making processes, moving away from reliance on senior management or specific experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. This consensus model brings diverse perspectives and helps address inherent biases in decision-making, crucial for complex challenges like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
*   **Organizational Change** Implementing a portfolio approach fundamentally changes an organization, acting as a significant change management process that shifts behaviors and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. It pushes people out of their comfort zones but facilitates learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

### Facilitating Societal Transformation
Sitra, the Finnish futures fund, positions itself as a facilitator of innovation portfolios in the public sector, primarily focusing on systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. They aim to support other organizations and their internal teams in building capacities around these approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Sitra's work highlights:
*   **Addressing Wicked Problems** Innovation portfolio management is a relatively new field, necessitating the bringing together of people to build understanding and approaches for complex, open-ended "wicked problems" like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. These problems involve multiple stakeholders, constant change, and diverse scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **Shifting Focus from Organization-Centric to Transformative Collaboration** Traditional strategic portfolio management is often organization-centric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. Innovation portfolio management, however, aims to foster transformation in the world, requiring [[collaborative_approaches_in_public_sector_innovation | collaboration]] across an ecosystem of actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. Projects become experimental means of learning about and tackling problems, rather than flat execution of defined solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   **Building Capabilities for Continuous Learning** Successful implementation requires integrating sense-making and intelligence practices for continuous learning and adaptation across projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. This includes ensuring portfolio composition allows for synergies between projects to maximize impact and focusing on designing and visualizing the impact of the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## Implications for Leadership
Effective [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_sector_innovation | cross-sectoral and multi-level collaboration]] requires a different kind of leadership. It moves away from relying on "hero leaders" and instead emphasizes systems leadership, where various individuals within the system can take the lead on different issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This form of leadership enables transformation and ensures that the system as a whole achieves diverse outcomes, not just those mandated by a single organization or project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. It requires leaders to be comfortable with uncertainty, let go of the need to have all the answers, and create space for diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

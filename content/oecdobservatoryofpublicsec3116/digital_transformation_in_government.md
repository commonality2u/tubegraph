[[Digital transformation in governance | Digital transformation in government]] focuses on making the most of [[digital transformation and egovernment | digital opportunities]] to design and deliver public services that meet user expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This transformation aims to build trust in public institutions by ensuring services are inclusive and responsive to people's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the public's expectation for governments to be "digital by default," mirroring shifts in personal and working interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This created pressure for accelerated [[public sector digital transformation | digital transformation]] efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. While rapid deployment was often necessary, it didn't always lead to stable, consistent, or long-term results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.

## Key Challenges in Digital Transformation
A poll conducted during a conference revealed that the top challenges for [[digital transformation and egovernment | digital by default]] concepts in government include:
*   Skills and capabilities of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   Different silos in government that operate services in different places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.
*   Lack of collaboration inside government to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

Other significant challenges mentioned by speakers include:
*   Inconsistent multi-channel performance and interrupted digital journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   Legal and ethical considerations for data exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.
*   A "digital by default" mindset can limit thinking, leading to disconnected experiences if e-services are seen as entirely separate from traditional ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   Difficulty in simplifying services at their core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
*   Ensuring communication around services is accessible and understandable by everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
*   The challenge of digital identity in being inclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
*   Overcoming the perception that digital transformation implies closing in-person access to government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
*   Digital literacy gaps within the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

## Key Success Factors and Enablers

### User-Centric Design & Inclusivity
*   **Focus on User Needs:** Services must be designed with users in mind, usable, and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This requires extensive research and talking to citizens, including specific user groups like farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **Accessible Communication:** Simplify language and ensure communications are accessible, for instance, by producing content in "French easy to read and to understand" (FALC) format for broader comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
*   **Empathy and Observation:** Designers and developers can benefit from observing how people use digital services in "mediation centers" to remind them of the need for simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>.
*   **Digital Skills Training:** Governments can offer specific programs, like "digital passes" or training digital advisors, to improve the [[digitalization and government services | digital skills]] of citizens, particularly those less comfortable with online channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>. Long-term investments like introducing computer science in schools are also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>.

### Omnichannel Approach
*   **Multiple Channels:** Good services support multiple channels (digital, physical, telephone) and allow users to switch between them throughout their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   **Physical Presence:** Maintaining traditional physical channels, even if more expensive or with limited hours, is vital for those who cannot or do not want to use digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Slovenia's traditionally excellent physical administrative services contribute to lower digital service usage, but also highlight the importance of physical access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Assisted Access:** Portugal's "citizen spaces" and "mobile cities and spaces" offer assistance from trained mediators to help citizens use digital services, bridging the digital divide and improving [[digitalization and government services | digital literacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Similarly, France has "French houses" (France Services) that welcome people for various matters, including digital service assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>.

### Data Use and Governance
*   **Efficient Data Exchange:** Leveraging existing government data registers with common identifiers (e.g., personal identification numbers) is crucial for efficient data exchange and processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. This supports the "once-only" principle, where citizens don't need to provide data already held by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Trust:** Governments must ensure transparency regarding the content and use of personal data to build citizen trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>. This requires clear legal bases and ethical guidelines for data processing and reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.
*   **Independent Oversight:** An outside institution, such as an information commissioner or data protection authority, can provide respected oversight and audits to calm public debate and ensure data practices are trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.
*   **Strategic Data Management:** An overarching strategic data management approach is essential, covering open, closed, and personal data at technical, semantic, organizational, and legal levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

### Skills and Mindset
*   **Digital Mindset:** Public servants need digital skills and an understanding of agile ways of working to react quickly to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Investing in Workforce:** Systematically improving the knowledge and skills of service providers through initiatives like administration academies accelerates the development of a modern business culture, improved cooperation, and user focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Leadership Buy-in:** Top-down commitment from senior government levels is crucial for driving systematic transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. Political interest in [[public sector digital transformation | digital transformation]] can lead to measures like digital literacy programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.

### Collaboration and Institutional Frameworks
*   **Cross-Departmental Collaboration:** Services should not stop at departmental boundaries; collaboration across government is essential for joined-up services that meet user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Unified Platforms:** A single domain for government (e.g., gov.uk) can simplify government by forcing departments to work together on services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Institutional Networks:** Pre-existing networks, like Portugal's Council for Information and Communication Technology and the Interministerial Network for Modernization, are crucial for coordinating strategy and enabling quick responses during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

### Common Components/Platforms
*   **Reusable Building Blocks:** Developing a toolkit of thoroughly tested building blocks (e.g., platforms for notifications, identity checks, form builders) enables rapid development of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Documented Design Patterns:** Standardized design patterns ensure consistency in how digital services look and function, speeding up development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Design Systems:** Building design systems helps homogenize services, making them more comfortable and familiar for users across different government interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.
*   **Digital Identity:** A systematic approach to digital identity, such as a new electronic identity card, can provide citizens with an effective "ticket to the digital world" for accessing advanced services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

## Role of Innovation Labs
[[Innovation and digital transformation in public services | Innovation]] labs can serve as valuable "test beds" and provide good examples that inspire public servants and promote an agile, adaptive organizational culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>. They offer a space to experiment and fail, which is key for progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>. However, there's a risk of them being seen as separate from the main organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. To be effective, innovation labs need a clear plan for how their findings will be applied across government and should be backed by the power to influence change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>. Innovation should also focus on improving existing services, not just building new ones, and rationalizing current systems for better maintainability and environmental impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a rapid and widespread [[Digital transformation and egovernance | digital transformation]] within government and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a>. This shift occurred out of necessity, with implementations that would typically take years being completed in days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. This highlighted government's capacity for innovation, agility, and quick adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>.

## Key Observations and Challenges

### Rapid Digital Adoption
Governments across the world swiftly adopted digital tools and processes, including working remotely and collaborating across silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>. This demonstrated the inherent capabilities and strengths within public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>. Frontline services experienced shortened feedback loops with central government, which was a welcome development, allowing for real-time feedback on community needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. Much of the typical bureaucracy disappeared, showcasing a mindset shift in addition to technological adaptations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:10]</a>.

### Human-Centricity and Inclusion
Despite the rapid [[Digital Transformation of Public Services | digitalization]], it is crucial that human-centric regulations accompany these digital approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>. Data privacy, transparency, and digital rights must be at the core of every [[Role of digital transformation in public administration | digital transformation]] strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02:00">[30:02:00]</a>. Digital tools are means to an end and should not replace the essential human elements, ensuring that people remain at the center of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>.

A significant concern is the need for inclusion, ensuring that [[Digital transformation and inclusion in government services | digitalization of government services]] does not leave anyone behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:33:00">[30:33:00]</a>. The pandemic disproportionately affected vulnerable groups, including women and migrants, highlighting the need for solutions that reflect institutional diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>.

### Beyond Transposing Processes
It is insufficient to merely transpose existing physical processes into the digital world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. A critical reflection is necessary to determine if current approaches to service delivery are truly effective before [[Digital transformation in public administration | digitalizing]] them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:56:00">[30:56:00]</a>. Jose Mendez Mendoza highlighted that many governments simply [[Digitalization of government services | digitalized]] services by putting them online, but the backend bureaucracies remained the same, forcing public servants to replicate manual processes from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>. This is not true [[Digitalization of government services | digitalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.

For effective [[Digital transformation of public services | digital transformation]], governments need new skills and competencies, especially in managing high-frequency, disaggregated, and fluid data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>.

## Towards a New Era for Government

The experience of the pandemic, along with other societal movements like Black Lives Matter, has created an opportunity to think bigger picture and move away from short-term thinking often driven by political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

### Sustaining the Digital Shift
The crucial question is whether governments can maintain the experimental mindset and new ways of working adopted during the pandemic once the crisis fades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. Sustaining the rapid pace of [[Agile and Digital Transformation in Government | digital transformation]] and adaptation requires integrating this agility into the entire system, leadership, and fundamental structure of government, rather than it remaining an individual responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26:00">[28:26:00]</a>.

### Anticipatory Capacities and Futures Thinking
The COVID-19 crisis highlighted the inability to foresee and measure its impact, demonstrating a lack of anticipatory capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. There is a recognized need to build "anticipatory capacities and policies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>. Surveys show that "anticipation and futurist thinking" are the top innovation methods participants want to see gain more traction beyond COVID-19, followed by systems approaches and [[Agile and Digital Transformation in Government | agile and adaptive working methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27:00">[40:27:00]</a>. This suggests a growing appetite for governments to implement these proactive approaches before facing the next challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>.

Many of the trends observed in [[Digital transformation in public administration | government transformation]] and [[Digitalization of government services | digitalization]] have been ongoing for 10-15 years, but the pandemic acted as a major catalyst for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>. The crisis serves as a powerful opportunity to "reimagine government so that it works for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. This involves unlearning old assumptions and mental models that hinder systems thinking and agile responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. The shift aims to redefine government institutions not just as "delivery institutions" but as "managers of well-being," focusing on creating an environment where people feel safe, trust in government, and can develop properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>.

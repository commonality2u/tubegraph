When innovation occurs and "dominant designs" emerge, it becomes very difficult to change things later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These dominant designs influence and lock in subsequent systems and infrastructure for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Examples of Dominant Designs
*   **Road Traffic Systems:** The decision, made long ago, about which side of the road cars drive on (either the right or left side) was an innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This choice locked in many mobility systems, influencing how cars are driven and how infrastructure is developed for going from one place to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This foundational innovation in "training practices" from a long time ago still shapes current realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Emerging Technologies:** New technological and non-technological choices made today can become innovations and dominant designs in their own right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Examples include:
    *   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** A major current concern is determining the necessary technological or ethical solutions for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   **Blockchain:** Governments need to consider what type of blockchain solutions should be adopted, or if they should be adopted at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Influencing Dominant Designs through Anticipatory Innovation
Governments need to be "a little ahead of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, even if it's not always possible to know with certainty what will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. They must analyze and consider a variety of possible futures to "possibly influence the dominant designs that are emerging already" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

[[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] is crucial for this process, as it involves anticipating different solutions and shaping emerging innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This includes addressing ethical boundaries for technologies like AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

These questions are possible to influence now, but likely not in ten or fifteen years, once AI is prevalent or a large proportion of the population uses blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. To be proactive and ensure the best outcomes for their people and countries, governments must anticipate future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

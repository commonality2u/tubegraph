Navigating the intricate landscape of contemporary policy challenges can be made easier through the incorporation of diverse perspectives from various countries united by a shared objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Cross-border experimentation and coordination are particularly important when addressing challenges that transcend national boundaries, where solutions can benefit the global public welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## The Role of Behavioral Science in Policy

The success of many policy issues, such as the climate emergency, socioeconomic inequalities, or the growing influence of digital technologies on public life, can be partly attributed to the individual behaviors and preferences of the people they aim to serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. [[Public sector innovation and global trends | Behavioral experimentation]] is increasingly utilized by policymakers to test the effectiveness of policies, guided by empirical evidence and a focus on placing individuals at the core of policy design, implementation, and evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Addressing Misinformation as a Global Challenge

Misinformation and disinformation represent a critical global challenge, with their spread heavily reliant on individual behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Effective responses to this issue must be designed and tested across borders, ideally through collaboration among governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

An example of such an effort is the health misinformation toolkit developed by the Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) in the U.S. federal government with the Office of the Surgeon General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This toolkit aims to explain motivations behind sharing misinformation and help curb the spread of health-related false information, providing exercises to recognize and address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## International Collaboration and Experimentation

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has initiated a significant international partnership with the Canadian and French governments to develop and disseminate solutions for tackling misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This collaboration is considered a first-of-its-kind cross-border initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

The partnership involves:
*   The OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>
*   The Impact and Innovation Unit in the Canadian Privy Council Office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   The French Behavioral Insights Unit in the Ministry of Public Transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>

### Objectives of the Collaboration

The collaboration had three main objectives:
1.  To better understand the complexities of why people share misinformation on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
2.  To evaluate the impact of behavioral interventions on choices to share fake news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
3.  To co-develop best practices to inform policy responses to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Key Findings from the Experiment

The experiment found that:
*   Individuals sometimes share fake news even when they do not believe it to be true, indicating a disconnect between sharing intentions and knowledge of accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   Digital media literacy tips had the most significant impact on online users, reducing intentions to share fake news by 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. These tips were effective across different clusters of participants, including those with varying levels of trust and susceptibility to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.
*   Individual differences in trust and information consumption patterns influence beliefs and the sharing of misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Three clusters were identified:
    *   **Non-trusting**: Low trust in all sources, low openness to evidence, high conspiratorial thinking, high psychological reactance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
    *   **High-trusting**: High trust in all information sources (especially social media), low openness to evidence, medium-high conspiratorial thinking, high psychological reactance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
    *   **Institution-trusting**: High trust in institutional sources but low trust in social media, high openness to evidence, low conspiratorial thinking, low psychological reactance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
    The non-trusting and high-trusting clusters exhibited significantly greater belief and sharing of fake news compared to the institution-trusting cluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

### Policy Implications

Three key policy messages emerged from this work:
1.  **Don't ignore the human factor**: A comprehensive policy response to misinformation must include an expanded understanding of human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
2.  **Empower people**: Empowering users with tools and understanding can offer effective and scalable solutions to complement holistic policy strategies and combat fake news without directly regulating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
3.  **Find what works across borders**: Governments should conduct rigorous policy experiments in collaboration with other countries to generate sustainable responses to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. This kind of [[international_trends_in_governmental_experimentation_and_innovation | international collaboration]] helps to learn from other teams, foster knowledge transfer, and broaden the tools available to policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Challenges in Governmental Innovation and Reform
> Coordinating efforts across international teams, as seen in this collaboration, often presents [[challenges_in_governmental_innovation_and_reform | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. However, such partnerships provide a valuable "Brain Trust" for navigating complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. They facilitate real-time dialogue and connect teams with global academic experts, which is instrumental in validating assumptions and providing technical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

The OECD's broader initiative on "Building Trust and Reinforcing Democracy" emphasizes that democracy is currently fragile and that misinformation is a symptom of a larger problem: the erosion of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. This initiative looks at [[challenges_and_solutions_in_global_governance | key governance challenges]] to democracy, including misinformation, participation, governmental setup for global challenges, climate action delivery, and digital democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. The work on misinformation, which involves building societal resilience (including media literacy), regulatory perspectives on transparency, and competition angles related to platforms, contributes significantly to these broader efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.

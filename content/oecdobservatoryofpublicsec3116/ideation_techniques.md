[[Ideation and generating good ideas | Ideation]] is a critical component of the innovation process, particularly in the public sector. While often associated with brainstorming, it encompasses much more, including finding, screening, and prioritizing ideas from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Ideation in the Innovation Lifecycle

The innovation lifecycle involves several stages: identifying problems, generating ideas, [[developing_innovation_proposals | developing proposals]], [[implementing_innovative_ideas | implementation]], and [[evaluating_and_selecting_innovative_ideas | evaluation and diffusing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This process can be visualized using a double diamond model, which includes a problem definition phase and a solution creation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### The Importance of Problem Framing

Before delving into [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation]], it is crucial to spend sufficient time on problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. In the public sector, civil servants often start after the problem has already been defined, sometimes even with a solution pre-determined for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Neglecting problem framing can lead to negative results, projects that fail to deliver expected returns, and confusion when initiatives fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. It is essential to understand the context of the problem and spend more time defining it before moving to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Even when given a defined problem, there is always room to innovate by finding better solutions or making incremental improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## What Ideation is *Not*

Common misconceptions about [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation]] include:
*   **Closed-Room Brainstorming** The image of a closed room filled with post-it notes from a brainstorming session is only a part of generating ideas, not the entirety of [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation]] in government or private sector [[innovation strategies | innovation processes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The best results are not produced by isolating a select group of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **A Lone Wolf Effort** [[Ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | Ideation]] and innovation are team efforts, rarely achieved by a single "lone wolf" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Fostering Creativity for Ideation

Many public sector workers believe they are not creative enough to [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. However, creativity is a resource that can be created and fostered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **Combating Groupthink** One of the major enemies of [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation]] and innovation is groupthink, where people think alike due to prolonged interaction without diverse input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Diversity of Backgrounds** Expanding the range of experiences and backgrounds of people involved in [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation]] helps increase creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Involving diverse stakeholders, including the target population, introduces different ways of thinking and constructive conflict, which fuels creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.
*   **Adaptivity and Application** Creativity is not just about new ideas, but also about adapting existing solutions to new contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. For example, applying a video game system to solve a problem in a different industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
*   **Diverse Reading** Reading diverse materials helps challenge assumptions and understand what is possible, fostering creative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Experience in Innovation** People become more creative by gaining experience in thinking outside the box and applying innovative ideas in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. Public sectors need to provide opportunities to test ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

## Tailoring Ideation to the Innovation Context

The approach to [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation]] is closely linked to the type of problem being solved and the purpose of the innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Innovation can be viewed along two dimensions:
1.  **Uncertainty**:
    *   **High Uncertainty (Exploratory Phase)**: Dealing with emerging technologies like AI or blockchain, where solutions and options are unknown but hold great promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This requires looking for signals from outside partners and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
    *   **Certainty (Exploiting Phase)**: Focused on making existing systems more effective or efficient, often through incremental [[innovation strategies | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. It's about leveraging existing knowledge and adapting novel solutions to your context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Directive/Demand**:
    *   **Clear Top-Down Demand (Mission-Oriented Innovation)**: Problems are defined by senior leadership with expected outcomes, such as education reform or tax system improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
    *   **Adaptive Innovation (User-Driven)**: Experimenting with various solutions, often driven by bottom-up feedback from citizens experiencing public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. This allows for quick experimentation without extensive top leadership involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. For design-oriented or citizen-oriented problems, stakeholders must be involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

These quadrants dictate the type of ideas to seek and the methods for obtaining them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

## Practical Ideation Checklist

The OECD offers a basic checklist for [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation]] to ensure ideas are appropriate and the process is followed correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>:

1.  **Problem Framing**: Have you spent enough time studying and understanding the problem, ensuring you are truly ready to move into [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>? Avoid rushing to solutions based on limited data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>.
2.  **Innovation Environment**: Do you understand the innovation environment (top-down vs. bottom-up, leadership resistance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>? This knowledge is important for understanding how much leeway you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.
3.  **Strategy Alignment**: Does your [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation]] strategy match your environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>? For emergent problems with little internal expertise, a broad strategy like crowdsourcing or idea challenges might be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. For more understood problems, a smaller, select group may suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
4.  **Right People Engaged**: Have you engaged the right people, specifically a diverse group with varied backgrounds, thinking styles, and gender diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>? Avoid groups with similar backgrounds and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.
5.  **Inclusive Contribution**: Does your [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation]] strategy allow everyone to contribute effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>? Recognize that people work differently; not everyone thrives in high-movement environments, and some need more time to develop ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>. [[Ideation and generating good ideas | Ideation]] can span days or weeks, not just hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.

### Self-Assessment for Ideation Readiness

A self-assessment tool can help gauge readiness for [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation]]. This involves rating aspects like:
*   Clear problem definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   Certainty and agreement on the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
*   Likelihood of the problem shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
*   Existence of previous solutions or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.
*   Presence of a clear, engaged problem owner with high-level discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

This self-assessment helps guide not just [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation]] but also problem definition and subsequent stages like [[developing_innovation_proposals | proposals]] and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.

## Filtering and Prioritizing Ideas

After generating numerous ideas, the next step is to narrow them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. This initial sifting aims to identify a handful of promising ideas that can provide more information or potentially solve the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

*   **Beyond Simplistic Scoring Models**: While common, simplistic scoring models (e.g., novelty, usefulness, value, acceptance, feasibility, risk) are often insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. A single model cannot effectively filter ideas for all types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.
*   **Mission Consistency**: For mission-oriented innovation (e.g., solving poverty), the primary selection criterion should be the idea's consistency with the mission and its systematic contribution to the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. Novelty might be less important than functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory/Radical Ideas**: For [[anticipatory_innovation_and_futures_thinking | anticipatory]] or radical ideas (e.g., exploring new technologies), traditional legitimacy or low-risk propositions might not apply, as existing feedback systems may reject them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.
*   **Beware of Bias**: Methods like "shark tank" or "dragon dens" where people pitch ideas can be problematic. They often favor the loudest or most persuasive person rather than the best idea, and many innovators may avoid such confrontational formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. An inclusive filtering strategy explores diverse methods to avoid biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>.
*   **Context-Dependent Strategy**: There isn't one "best" solution for narrowing ideas. The chosen strategy must align with the goals and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>. For mission-oriented goals, many ideas might be explored, while iterative exploration might lead to a shorter list of options for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

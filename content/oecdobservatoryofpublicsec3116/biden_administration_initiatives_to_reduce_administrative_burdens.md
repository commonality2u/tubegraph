## Biden Administration Initiatives to Reduce Administrative Burdens

The Biden Administration has undertaken significant initiatives to address [[administrative_burdens_in_citizens_and_government_interactions | administrative burdens]] faced by citizens when interacting with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:02">[01:59:02]</a>. These efforts build upon the research presented in the book "Administrative Burden: Policymaking by Other Means" by Professor Pam Herd and Professor Don Moynihan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### Policy Framework and Executive Orders

The Biden Administration's approach to reducing administrative burdens began relatively early in its term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>:
*   **Racial Equity Executive Order** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>: Initially, an executive order on racial equity was signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   **Customer Experience Executive Order** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>: In December 2021, a more extensive customer experience executive order was signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This order directly links reducing government burdens to improving customer experience and public trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Its explicit goal is to improve trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

The administration has provided guidance to agencies from the center of government, emphasizing the importance of measuring and taking action on administrative burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### New Tools and Repurposed Processes

The Biden Administration has introduced new tools and practices, and repurposed existing processes to center on administrative burden reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>:

*   **Human-Centered Design**: The customer experience executive order explicitly states that it is now government policy to adopt human-centered design to review and redesign existing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This approach considers how to systematically apply design practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Mandatory Reporting Integration**: Agencies are now required to pay more attention to measuring and reporting on customer experience and burden reduction initiatives as part of their annual budget preparations and mandatory performance reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **Paperwork Reduction Act Reinterpretation**: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has reinterpreted the Paperwork Reduction Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, which traditionally focused on measuring time spent filling out forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Under new guidance, agencies must now consider [[administrative_burdens_in_citizens_and_government_interactions | learning costs]], compliance costs (beyond just forms, including documentation), and [[administrative_burdens_in_citizens_and_government_interactions | psychological costs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. This repurposes existing statutory tools to be more centered on administrative burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Expanding Automatic Medicaid Renewal

A key focus of these initiatives has been expanding automatic renewal for public health insurance programs like Medicaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

*   **Medicaid Program Background**: Medicaid is the primary way low-income individuals in the U.S. access health insurance coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. It's a federally funded program administered by individual states, requiring annual re-eligibility proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. Historically, many people lose coverage due to procedural reasons during renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   **Post-Pandemic Push for Ex Parte Renewals**: At the end of the [[pandemicinduced_changes_in_government_operations | pandemic]], the Biden Administration urged state governments to expand "ex parte" or automatic renewal in Medicaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. This means if a state has data confirming continued eligibility, they should renew without requiring individuals to go through the full process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. Waivers and flexibilities were offered to states to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   **National Impact**: From 2023 to 2024, there has been a significant increase in ex parte renewals nationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. The average rate of automatic renewal for Medicaid participants rose from approximately one in four to almost one in two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. This has reduced the need for millions of people to complete paperwork and experience burdens, also lowering the risk of coverage loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

#### State-Level Example: Minnesota

*   **Collaboration with Code for America**: In Minnesota, a project focused on expanding automatic renewal for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled population, a particularly vulnerable group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. Code for America, a non-profit civic tech firm, provided technological skills to help the state organize and connect administrative data from various government sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. This data was then provided to caseworkers to facilitate automatic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
*   **Results**: Before this expansion, about 40% of this population had their coverage renewed automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. After implementation, this rate increased to nearly 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.
*   **Reducing Inequality**: The study also found that automatic renewal significantly increased enrollment for non-white families, especially Black families, bringing their enrollment rates closer to the average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. This suggests that automatic renewal helps to [[impact_of_administrative_burdens_on_inequality | level the playing field]] by reducing hurdles that disproportionately affect disadvantaged families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

#### National-Level Intervention: US Digital Service

*   **"Tiger Team" Approach**: The U.S. Digital Service (USDS), an organization of digital experts within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>, sent experts to specific states for about a week to help improve services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.
*   **Capacity Building**: These USDS teams brought both technical and policy capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>:
    *   **Technical Capacity**: Identifying data sources for eligibility verification and reviewing state code for errors and policy consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Policy Capacity**: Informing states about existing flexibility and national policy to maximize opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.
*   **Impact**: This intervention helped four lower-performing states raise their automatic renewal rates to the national average, even as the overall national average was increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

While [[role_of_technology_and_digitalization_in_reducing_administrative_burdens | technology]] and automation are powerful tools, their implementation requires careful consideration to avoid unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.

#### Potential Pitfalls of Automation

Automation, especially using algorithms, can go wrong if not properly managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>:
*   **Focus on Fraud Minimization**: Cases in Australia and the Netherlands showed that disproportionate focus on minimizing fraud, rather than maintaining access to benefits, led to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
*   **Algorithmic Bias and Failure**: Algorithms can introduce bias and have many false positives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>. Without sufficient human oversight, negative effects can go unchecked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.
*   **Burden Shift to Clients**: In problematic automation cases, the state shifted more burdens back onto clients, requiring them to prove innocence or provide extensive documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

#### Key Lessons for [[innovation_in_public_administration | Burden Reduction]]

A report commissioned by the U.S. federal government identified several key lessons for successful burden reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>:

*   **Building a Public-Centered Culture**: It is challenging to build a culture that centers on the public's experience of administrative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>. Tools like human-centered design and journey mapping are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>.
*   **Capacity Building**: Changing practice requires capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>. Successful agencies often have dedicated customer experience staff whose primary role is to review and revise processes based on public feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.
*   **Collaboration and Data Sharing**: Redesigning processes often necessitates collaboration across multiple agencies, particularly for data sharing to simplify eligibility verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>.
*   **Simplifying and Reviewing Processes**: Governments are generally good at building new systems and adding rules but less effective at reviewing existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. Regular review is essential to ensure systems remain fit for purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Use of [[role_of_technology_and_digitalization_in_reducing_administrative_burdens | Technology]]**: [[role_of_technology_and_digitalization_in_reducing_administrative_burdens | Technology]] can be a great enabler, especially when leveraging administrative data to shift burdens from the public to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>. However, blind faith in [[role_of_technology_and_digitalization_in_reducing_administrative_burdens | technology]] can lead to blind spots, increasing burdens and worsening outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. When implementing [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | digital transformation]], governments should aim to create an easy path for the majority while reallocating resources to assist those facing greater difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Measurement of Burdens
> While compliance costs related to time and money are well-measured, understanding learning and psychological costs remains a [[challenges_requiring_government_innovation | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a>. Qualitative methods, such as focus groups and interviews with community organizations and individuals, can provide insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>. For people engaging with programs, user surveys at every step, even short one or two-question surveys, can help identify bottlenecks and patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>. [[administrative_burdens_in_citizens_and_government_interactions | Uncertainty]], for instance, can create significant [[administrative_burdens_in_citizens_and_government_interactions | administrative burden]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:47:00">[39:47:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Behavioral Science Role
> Behavioral science can contribute by providing randomized control trials and AB testing to evaluate interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:47:00">[51:47:00]</a>. It's crucial to document and disseminate results, even through peer review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:12:00">[52:12:00]</a>. Behavioral science can also integrate with design thinking to modernize government problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:42:00">[52:42:00]</a>, and consistently emphasize the importance of rigorous evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:03:00">[53:03:00]</a>.

The world is changing rapidly, making the future quite unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. To navigate this uncertain future, it is crucial to understand where disruptions originate and where the world is heading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of technology, pushing the public sector towards new interactions with citizens and a greater degree of automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

## Citizen Expectations and Service Delivery

Citizens today experience excellent services from the private sector and therefore expect public sector services to be customer-focused, efficient, innovative, personalized, and enabled by technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The challenge for the public sector is how to provide such excellent services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Strategies for [[Public sector innovation and digital transformation | Digital Transformation]]

To meet evolving citizen needs and navigate a complex future, the public sector must [[public_sector_innovation | innovate]] and transform how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Embracing Agile Practices

This transformation involves becoming more innovative and agile, practicing structures and ways of working that include formalizing agile working practices like remote working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The public sector can be an agile organization capable of providing excellent services for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. To be agile, an organization should be flexible, adapting to citizens' needs, flatter, connected, team-based, and aligned with strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Importance of Data and Analytics

Using data and analytics is crucial for building evidence-based policy making and finding innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Predictive analytics, supported by data, allows for a public sector that takes very good care of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Co-creating Services with Citizens

Promoting active citizenship and creating platforms to connect directly with people is crucial for co-creating services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Technology, particularly digital means, also introduces hyper-personalization and distribution, making it possible to single out and analyze individual person's needs to personalize experiences and interactions with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. This can build services from a bottom-up, local perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

### Strategic Workforce Planning and Development

Having the right people in the right places is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This requires strategic workforce planning, recruiting innovative and collaborative civil servants, and redesigning jobs and processes to enable greater efficiency and innovative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Continuously upskilling and reskilling civil servants is crucial, as skills need to keep pace with new technologies and complex societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Beyond technical specializations, critical thinking, creativity, [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], problem-solving, and anticipating future scenarios are important skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The most important skill will be the ability to continuously learn and adapt, necessitating public administration to become a learning organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## The Future of the Public Sector

The public sector needs to become dynamic by design rather than relying on separate stable and dynamic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>. Dynamic organizations are also resilient by design, able to offer services and solutions in times of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

### Forces for and Against Change

Governments are fundamentally set up as stability-seeking and bureaucratic institutions, which can make radical change difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. However, events like the last year have shown that change can happen more radically than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. There is a need for a continued proactive push towards [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], change, agility, and the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

### Leveraging Strategic Foresight

[[public_sector_innovation_trends | Strategic foresight]] and future thinking are crucial capabilities for the public sector to navigate uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. This includes:
*   **Scouting for Signals**: Detecting early signals of change and emerging issues, giving them names to facilitate conversation among leaders and policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **Scenario Planning**: A methodical, disciplined process (like Singapore's practice since the 1980s) to understand and prepare for different futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.
*   **Challenging Mindsets and Structures**: Foresight helps identify incompatibilities between current mindsets/structures and desired futures. For example, the rhetoric of being a "smart city" can be incompatible with resistance to remote work due to ingrained mindsets about performance appraisal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. Similarly, embracing agile ways of working can be impeded by existing procurement processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.
*   **Immersing in Future Experiences**: Using storytelling and scenarios to create empathy and a "lived experience" of potential futures helps challenge current thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Playing the Long Game**: Cultivating the capability to think about the future through formal training and "doing as training," building communities of practice, and encouraging collaborations among public agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.

### New Leadership and Organization

The future requires new forms of organization, embracing self-management, wholeness (bringing the whole person to work), and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. New leadership involves discovering what kind of change is needed and leading for exploration, openness, and discovery rather than control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>. Leaders must explore problems, leverage empathy with citizens' needs, navigate ambiguity, and insist on rehearsing and experimenting with the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>.

### Technology's Dual Trajectories

Technology is influencing the public sector in different ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>:
*   **Centralized Control**: Technologies like blockchain and AI allow for very centralized control and algorithmic governance with predictive traits, potentially leading to flatter organizations where decision-making is concentrated among a few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **Hyper-Personalization and Distribution**: At the same time, technology enables hyper-personalization and distribution of services, making it possible to cater to individual needs and build services from a bottom-up, local perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.

### Challenging Entrenched Futures

The public sector needs to challenge deeply entrenched futures, including:
*   **The Idea of Capitalism**: Moving beyond the opposition between government and market to recognize that markets are co-created by various actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>.
*   **The Growth Narrative**: Questioning the reliance on GDP growth as the sole measure of success, especially given its inability to address climate emergency or inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.
*   **Linearity and Progress**: Rejecting the paradigm of linearity and the belief that the future will always be better than the past, especially as generations now believe the future may be worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. Instead, there is an opportunity to build a more inclusive, circular, and connected economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.

### [[Public sector challenges and transformations | Challenges and Opportunities]]

The public sector must embrace diversity of analytical viewpoints, integrating ethnographic analysis alongside traditional statistical and economic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>. The ability to reframe problems and the ethics of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] are also key capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. The current moment of "liquefaction" – where what was solid turns to liquid – presents a unique opportunity to rethink design, moving towards "human connected design" that considers humans connected to each other, AI, infrastructure, places, and the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>. It is a moment to "smash up the jelly" of government and make something new that won't revert to old forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>.

The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) is presented as a crucial tool for driving continuous improvement and fostering [[innovation in public administration | innovation]] within public sector organizations. The aim is to integrate quality, [[innovation in public administration | innovation]], and better regulation to serve citizens and businesses effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## The Connection Between Quality and Innovation
Research indicates that both quality practices and [[innovation in public administration | innovation]] are interconnected and essential, creating a platform for organizations to improve and foster an innovative mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The CAF model helps organizations prepare for uncertainties and disruptions by promoting constant learning and understanding organizational performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This holistic approach to performance analysis aims to change the mindset of both the organization and its staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

CAF is more than a quality tool; it cultivates attributes that position public sector organizations to overcome disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. It aligns with characteristics of resilient and innovative organizations, such as being prepared, adaptable, collaborative, trustworthy, and responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

> "CAF acts as a coach towards organizational development and a coach towards a development of culture." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>

## CAF's Role in Organizational Culture and Systematic Improvement
[[Common Assessment Framework CAF for innovation in the public sector | CAF]] supports organizational development and culture by promoting continuous development and systematic improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. It helps detect levels of maturity and encourages closing the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, assisting organizational and cultural development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. This process of identifying strengths and areas for improvement makes an organization fitter, agile, and resilient, leading to a continuous cycle of development and [[innovation in public sector management | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

[[Common Assessment Framework CAF for innovation in the public sector | CAF]] provides a platform for mutual exchange of experience and development, fostering [[innovation in public administration | innovation]] by enabling organizations to learn from each other's successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

The 2020 version of the [[Common Assessment Framework CAF for innovation in the public sector | CAF]] model explicitly includes [[innovation in public administration | innovation]], mentioning it 50 times and reinforcing its presence compared to the 2013 version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. It is explicitly included in Principle 6: "Continued to learning [[innovation in public administration | innovation]] and improvement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>, and in Criteria 2 (Strategy and Planning), specifically sub-criteria 2.4, which focuses on managing change and [[innovation in public administration | innovation]] in an agile way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

## Case Studies: Improvements Driven by CAF

### Krakow City Administration: Enhancing Citizen Communication
The Krakow City Office has utilized [[common_assessment_framework_caf_for_innovation_in_the_public_sector | CAF]] since 2011, conducting four self-assessments, each leading to several improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. The 2017 self-assessment focused on improving communication with clients (citizens), especially relevant during the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. Key projects included:

*   **Taxpayer Portal (2018)**: An electronic tool providing an information platform on local taxes and fees and a personalized communication channel for tax liabilities, declarations, and payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. It significantly reduced phone inquiries and was promoted via short instructional movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Official Language (2019)**: Addressing the issue of administrative language being difficult for citizens to understand. Guidelines for writing documents and one-day training workshops were provided to officials on how to write and speak more inclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. This led to improved customer satisfaction regarding understanding official communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.
*   **Parcel Lockers for City Services (2020)**: Inspired by the COVID-19 crisis, this initiative allowed citizens to receive physical documents (like license plates) via parcel lockers, reducing queues and offering 24/7 accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.
*   **Integrated City Contact Center (2021)**: A new unit designed to centralize and improve telephone communication, providing information about various city and municipal services to citizens in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>. It aims to address issues of busy phone lines and confusion about which unit handles specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.

[[Common Assessment Framework CAF for innovation in the public sector | CAF]] served as a "trigger" for these improvements, inspiring new ideas and fostering a continuous process of change, rather than providing ready-made solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. The initial motivation for adopting CAF in Krakow was financial, through European Union funding for new management tools, but the positive results sustained the commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.

### Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and Sports: Employee Satisfaction Survey
The Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and Sports used their first [[common_assessment_framework_caf_for_innovation_in_the_public_sector | CAF]] self-assessment to identify the need for an employee survey to understand satisfaction, organizational climate, and mission comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. This led to a collaborative effort with seven other public organizations to create a uniform methodology for an employee survey called "Employee Eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>.

Objectives of the survey included:
*   Gaining insight into organizational workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.
*   Obtaining information for strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.
*   Developing a uniform methodology for comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   Preparing a customizable questionnaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.
*   Identifying benefits and opportunities for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

The partners focused on including "actionable" items in the questionnaireâ€”those that could lead to an action plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>. The process involved sharing good and bad practices and preparing effective communication to increase response rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. The most critical phase is the survey result dissemination (to management and all employees) and implementation, leading to realistic action plans and changes in the work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. Repeating the questionnaire allows organizations to assess the success of their implementation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>.

## CAF and Public Sector Resilience Post-COVID-19
The COVID-19 crisis highlighted the need for public administrations to be resilient to future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. The OECD, in collaboration with EIPA and the European Commission, is analyzing how organizations using [[common_assessment_framework_caf_for_innovation_in_the_public_sector | CAF]] adapted during the pandemic to draw lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Public administrations had to:
*   Create new institutional structures for crisis management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
*   Increase government expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.
*   Approve emergency regulations with fast-tracked processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   Implement new health and sanitary protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
*   Accelerate [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | digitalization]] of services and adopt widespread teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>.
*   Develop new communication protocols to counter misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

Post-crisis priorities for governments include restoring growth, protecting the vulnerable, building a green economy, debt sustainability, and employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>. This requires focusing on spending better, addressing global challenges (e.g., climate change), fostering inclusiveness, and rebuilding trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>.

Lessons learned for future resilience include the importance of preparedness, agility, cultivating skills for problem-solving and [[innovation in public administration | innovation]], developing foresight capacities ([[experimental_approaches_in_public_administration | experimental approaches in public administration]]), strengthening coordination and communication, and embedding cross-cutting challenges (environment, inclusiveness, [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | digitalization]], integrity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.

The [[common_assessment_framework_caf_for_innovation_in_the_public_sector | CAF]] model helps assess public organizations' preparedness and resilience across different dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. It can help identify innovations that will persist post-crisis, such as adapted managerial structures, contingency plans, teleworking policies, and improved procurement procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>. An ongoing project with Belgium and 10 other countries (including Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Finland, and Spain) aims to take stock of lessons from the crisis, promote emerging innovations, and strengthen the [[common_assessment_framework_caf_for_innovation_in_the_public_sector | CAF]] network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>.

## Impact on Human Resources Management
A poll conducted during the session indicated that participants perceived [[impact_of_caf_on_human_resources_management_in_public_organizations | human resource management]] as the area most affected by the use of [[common_assessment_framework_caf_for_innovation_in_the_public_sector | CAF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. This aligns with a Slovenian study that found a significant [[impact_of_caf_on_human_resources_management_in_public_organizations | impact of CAF on human resource management]] and people-related criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis highlighted weaknesses and areas for improvement in [[impact_of_caf_on_human_resources_management_in_public_organizations | human resource management]], such as adapting to remote and hybrid working methods and managing organizational knowledge differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.

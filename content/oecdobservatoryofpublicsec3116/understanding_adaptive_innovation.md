[[adaptive_innovation|Adaptive innovation]] is defined as an innovation focused on the discovery process itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It operates without clear, pre-defined goals, instead emphasizing the exploration of new ideas and the discovery of what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This approach is crucial for new ideas to emerge, as traditional thinking often remains within existing systems or paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Key Aspects of [[adaptive_innovation|Adaptive Innovation]]

[[adaptive_innovation|Adaptive innovation]] involves:
*   **On-the-ground exploration** of new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   These ideas may become useful for current government services or even challenge existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   It requires people to have the allowance and room for exploration from a bottom-up perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Those working closest to citizens can draw upon signals from their lives to innovate, test, or experiment based on feedback from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Outcomes of [[adaptive_innovation|Adaptive Innovation]]

[[adaptive_innovation|Adaptive innovation]] can lead to both:
*   **Transformative changes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Both types of outcomes are considered very much needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## [[adaptive_innovation_examples_in_regulatory_systems|Examples of Adaptive Innovation]]

Different [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovations]] have emerged in various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Canada's Regulatory System Example

In Canada, individuals have developed apps alongside their regular work to make the regulatory system more easily understandable and absorbable for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This means creating applications that help people understand, for instance, what regulations apply if they establish a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

This example highlights a shift in focus: the problem is no longer about simply having too much regulation, but rather making it understandable and usable for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This insight originated from [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

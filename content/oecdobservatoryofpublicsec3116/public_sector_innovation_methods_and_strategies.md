[[public_sector_innovation | Public sector innovation]] is crucial for governments to adapt to evolving demands and expectations in a rapidly changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. It involves moving beyond simplification, technology, or investigation to encompass building a culture of permanent productivity, encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration, and sharing knowledge and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This article explores various methods and [[public_sector_innovation_strategies | strategies]] for fostering [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]], with a particular focus on adaptive innovation.

## Adaptive Innovation: Core Concepts

Adaptive innovation centers on responding to change, asking how an evolved situation changes operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Organizations strong in adaptive innovation concentrate on exploring ideas, testing, and trying new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. The innovation itself can be part of a discovery process rather than a predefined goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

Key aspects of adaptive innovation from a research perspective include:
*   **Adapting to internal and external change** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.
*   **Learning and iteration** as core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Recognizing a complex ecosystem** in which adaptation takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on collaboration and bottom-up experimentation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

Adaptive innovation serves multiple purposes: as a capacity to adapt to change (especially in crises to build resilience), as a proactive approach to respond to change, and as a governance framework applicable to different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>. It rarely stands alone and can lead to transformative or enhancement-oriented change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.

### Drivers of Adaptive Innovation
Drivers appear at three levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>:
*   **Environmental**: External policy shifts or threats like COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
*   **Organizational**: Structural and cultural characteristics, such as resource availability or a culture of continuous improvement, teamwork, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Individual**: Employee willingness and openness to new methods, and ability to make fast decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

### Supporting Adaptive Innovation
Practices that support adaptive innovation include:
*   Providing organizational slack (spare time/capacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.
*   Empowering public servants with autonomy to explore alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
*   Creating incentives and clarifying reasons to innovate without being prescriptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   Clarifying acceptable levels of risk or experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.
*   Fostering formal and informal learning to keep staff updated on changes and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.

### Challenges of Adaptive Innovation
Known [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | challenges]] in establishing adaptive innovation capacity include:
*   Risk of fragmentation or lack of coherence, especially when projects bloom independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.
*   Difficulty incorporating successes and lessons into broader organizational and policy practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
*   Contextual factors making successful adaptive innovations hard to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   Internal organizational tension from challenging the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>.
*   Being responsive but lacking direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.
*   Inefficiencies from too much redundancy (e.g., multiple similar solutions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.
*   Slack resources being considered wasteful and easily cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.
*   Outcomes being ridiculed, disdained, or ignored if unexpected or contrary to existing culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.

Adaptive innovation should be part of a diverse [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] portfolio, supported by robust portfolio management and a policy environment that encourages different innovation purposes simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

## [[public_sector_innovation_strategies | Public Sector Innovation Strategies]] in Practice

### Portugal: Citizen Participation and Service Redesign
The Portuguese Administrative Modernization Agency's LabX team focuses on co-creating and experimenting with innovative solutions to improve public services, centering them around the real needs and expectations of citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.

*   **Citizen Shops Redesign**: LabX conducted fieldwork (surveys, observations) and co-creation workshops with citizens and civil servants to improve "citizen shops," which are one-stop service centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>. Prototypes were tested on-site in "living labs" to gather ongoing feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.
*   **Tax Authority Engagement**: LabX investigated how to improve communication and interaction between citizens and the tax authority through ethnographic work, in-depth interviews, and surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.
*   **Education for Citizenship with Youth**: Initially asked to develop an app, LabX first engaged children with a card game to understand their concerns and preferred methods of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This revealed that children often preferred playing outside or interacting with family over cell phones, which were sometimes given out of convenience by parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. The game itself evolved into a tool for developing citizenship, used in schools to initiate local projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>.
*   **Youth Engagement in Digital Services**: Despite being digital natives, young people make little use of public online services in Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>. LabX found that young people find public services difficult to understand due to complex language, feel lost, and prefer face-to-face interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. Recommendations include using plain language, providing performance support, offering a single point of contact for relevant services, and better advertising of public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. This is leading to a new measure within the Simplex program to adapt the e-Portugal platform for youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>.

### Japan: Agile Governance for Society 5.0
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has developed "Agile Governance" to manage a rapidly changing, digitalized "Society 5.0" (a human-centric society enabled by cyber-physical systems like AI and IoT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. The core challenge is building trust in new technologies in a complex and uncertain environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

The Agile Governance model aims to continuously and rapidly design rules and evaluate outcomes with multi-stakeholders in a horizontal way, moving away from traditional vertical governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. It comprises six steps:
1.  **Analysis**: Continuously analyze changing conditions and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
2.  **Goal Definition**: Define goals in accordance with societal and technological changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>.
3.  **System Design**: Design governance systems (technological, organizational, rules) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.
4.  **Implementation & Monitoring**: Continuously monitor system operation with real-time data and disclose information to stakeholders for accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
5.  **Evaluation**: Evaluate if initial goals have been accomplished, updating systems if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.
6.  **Re-analysis & Redefinition**: Continuously re-analyze external conditions and redefine goals as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.

This concept applies to various governance mechanisms (corporate governance, regulation, infrastructure, markets, societal norms) and includes a "governance of governance" to comprehensively design these mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. Strategies to implement agile governance include incentivizing businesses, redesigning goal-based regulations, using non-binding flexible standards, and employing regulatory sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

### United States: The 10x Program
The 10x program within the US General Services Administration (GSA) aims to improve the public's experience with the US government by addressing failures in government technology projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. It adopts a venture capital mindset, transforming ideas from government employees into "good for government" products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>.

10x differs in several ways:
*   **Sourcing Projects**: Ideas are solicited from any federal employee, recognizing that hands-on practitioners deal with problems daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.
*   **Funding Differently**: It uses an incremental funding model, starting with smaller amounts and requiring pitches for additional funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>. This contrasts with traditional lump-sum budgeting, which can lead to continued spending on unpromising projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.
*   **Mitigating Risk**: Rigorous milestones and checkpoints are established at each phase to ensure projects are worth pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. The philosophy is to "fail fast, fail forward, and fail small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>.
*   **Embracing Unknown Outcomes**: Projects start with a problem, and the solution path is figured out incrementally, allowing creative freedom for technologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>.

The 10x process involves phases:
1.  **Investigation**: Understand the problem space, identify red flags or duplications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>.
2.  **Discovery**: Understand the solution space, market fit, finances, and scalability, aiming for a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.
3.  **Development**: Build out the solution to a minimal viable product (MVP), ensuring an active customer uses it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.
4.  **Scale (if necessary)**: Proliferate the tool to increase users and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>.

Projects can be closed or successfully graduate at any phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. Key outcomes include the US Web Design System (reusable digital components for government websites) and the De-risking Technology Field Guide (guidance on acquiring custom software and agile governance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. The program also explores initiatives like Eligibility APIs, which encode eligibility criteria for government benefits into computer programs to streamline processes and ensure policy requirements are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>. 10x is expanding its focus beyond technology to investment themes like public trust and civic life, public lands and environment, and equity in delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:16">[01:28:16]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook for [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]]

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented avalanche of adaptive innovation in the public sector, demonstrating rapid prototyping and quick solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:17">[01:44:17]</a>. However, this speed came at a price, sometimes weakening public trust due to shifting measures and contradictory information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:03">[01:45:03]</a>. The crisis revealed structural inequalities, digital divides, and the spread of disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:10">[01:48:10]</a>.

A major challenge for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] is distinguishing between agility that supports a sustainable pluralistic society and agility that compromises fundamental values like human rights or the rule of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>. Governments must also balance efficiency (often seen in the private sector) with democratic values, transparency, accountability, and safeguarding the common good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:54">[01:52:54]</a>. Unlike the private sector, governments serve all citizens, including those in remote or disadvantaged areas, and must consider long-term goals like pension systems, education, and climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:03">[01:53:03]</a>.

### Measurement and Sustainability
Achieving sustainable and institutionalized change is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:35">[01:34:35]</a>. It requires involving all stakeholders, proving the value of innovative solutions, and showing tangible results to top management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:25">[01:33:25]</a>. The traditional evaluation criteria of economy, efficiency, and effectiveness may not fully capture adaptive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:42">[02:23:42]</a>. A fourth 'E' – efficacy (the ability to take action when things deviate) – is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:58">[02:23:58]</a>.

New evaluation methods, such as outcome harvesting, contribution analysis, and process analysis, can match adaptive innovation by developing alongside the project and focusing on shared outcomes with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>. While challenging to fund and implement, investing in appropriate evaluation processes for adaptive innovation can ultimately demonstrate its long-term economy, efficiency, and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:43">[02:25:43]</a>.

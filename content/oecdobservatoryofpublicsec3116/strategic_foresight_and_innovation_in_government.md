This article provides an overview of [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG)]], a framework discussed in a webinar leading up to the "Government Aftershock" conference. It explores the necessity of anticipatory approaches in government, the challenges faced, and the elements required to build systems that foster [[anticipatory innovation and foresight | anticipatory innovation and foresight]].

## Why Anticipate?
The world today is characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and novelty (VUCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Governments and public organizations face complex problems and new developments, from technological changes to environmental shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. To respond adequately and define a desired future, anticipation is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### The Innovator's Dilemma in the Public Sector
Established government practices and policies are not meant to last forever, as external conditions change and new ideas emerge, rendering old systems less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. A key challenge is the "innovator's dilemma," where current stakeholders, relying on existing services, might not express a need for future solutions, potentially giving misleading information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. New ideas, being imperfect initially, often underperform existing solutions, making early stakeholder feedback unreliable for transformative innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

### The Conundrum of Technological Control
The ability to influence technological development is much greater in its early phases than in later ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. For example, it was possible to influence the development of platform economies like Uber when they were starting, but it became very difficult to roll back changes once they had millions of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Governments must consider technological and non-technological changes early to embed values and influence outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. The challenge lies in influencing change when there is no evidence of impact, necessitating a different approach to creating evidence and experimenting rather than adopting a "wait and see" position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

### Static vs. Continuous Futures Perspectives
Governments often view the future from a static perspective, using tools like the futures cone for a one-time exercise to inform a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. However, the future does not work that way; creating five different scenarios might result in five ways of being wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Being [[anticipatory innovation and foresight | anticipatory]] and using [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] knowledge for [[Innovation Strategies for Governments | innovation in government]] requires a continuous practice to be impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Futures are created through ongoing dialogue in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. [[Anticipatory innovation and foresight | Anticipatory innovation]] is future-looking but grounded in present action, involving experimenting and developing ideas to test possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

## Key Concepts Defined

*   **Anticipation:** The act of creating knowledge about the future, drawn from existing contextual factors, underlying values and worldviews, assumptions, and emerging developments. It is connected to the potentiality and possibility of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.
*   **Innovation:** Acting upon knowledge to innovate systems (process, service, product) and explore alternative futures on the ground to influence the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. It's about moving towards a preferable future, not just waiting for something to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **[[Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG)]]:** A system including structures, institutions, agencies, and environment that supports the activity of anticipation and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. It addresses the inability within government to test critical, sometimes contradictory, or transformative ideas that go beyond current paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.

## Challenges to Anticipatory Innovation

### The Impact Gap of Strategic Foresight
While [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] is crucial for providing input into anticipation, reading weak signals, and integrating them into long-term planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, there's often an "impact gap" or "implementation gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Insights from [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] can be ignored because they may question current practices or produce undesirable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Without concrete actions or enforcement mechanisms, these challenges are easily overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

*   **Cassandra Effects:** People who foresee change may not be believed or have their ideas taken up within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Leadership Focus:** Leaders often deal with immediate current challenges, which can detract from looking at upcoming risks or opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Change:** Organizations are accustomed to existing ways of working and may resist dramatically different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Organizational Silos:** [[Strategic foresight in public policy | Strategic foresight]] tends to be siloed within governments, limiting its integration into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. Similarly, "digital silos" or "technology silos" can prevent a holistic view of how technology interacts with human and social contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>.
*   **Aversion to Challenging Assumptions:** Leaders may be averse to having assumptions and values challenged, especially if the future suggests current approaches are wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. There's also a "minimal squeak behavior" where painful but not immediate crises are ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.
*   **Political Risk and Accountability:** Leaders face political risk and accountability when making decisions about uncertain futures, and there's less accountability for missed opportunities than for things that go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. The public often expects leaders to have all the answers, which can be an unreasonable demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.
*   **Linear Thinking:** A tendency to treat policy problems as linear and present oneself as an expert can hinder the ability to address sources of uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

## Building an [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG)]] System

Building an [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG)]] system is a continuous process that involves constantly developing five core characteristics:

1.  **Demand:** Fostering a leadership culture that actively seeks [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] and [[anticipatory innovation for governments | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
2.  **Capacity:** Developing the knowledge and skills within the organization, such as having horizon scanners and scenario planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
3.  **Embeddedness:** Ensuring that other system elements, like electoral cycles and policy reviews, are coordinated with anticipatory activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. Implementation should be planned in advance to ensure insights are put into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
4.  **Institutions:** Establishing dedicated teams or institutions responsible for [[anticipatory innovation for governments | anticipatory innovation]] that connect with wider organizational functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.
5.  **Feedback:** Implementing systems to evaluate how well anticipation was used and what improvements can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

**Examples of System Building:**
*   **Finland:** Has one of the most advanced [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] systems in government, with multiple teams and institutions across ministries, the prime minister's office, and a parliamentary committee. They also have a community bringing together government, non-government, and academia for [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. The challenge here is the implementation gap between foresight knowledge and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.
*   **Helsingborg, Sweden:** Consciously decided to become an [[Anticipatory Innovation in the Public Sector | anticipatory organization]]. This involved building leadership capacity among city managers and politicians to discuss future issues and then enabling decisions to support [[anticipatory innovation for governments | anticipatory innovation]] projects as test beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.
*   **Ireland:** Collaborating to understand and outline the roles and capacities needed for an [[Anticipatory Innovation in the Public Sector | anticipatory innovation]] system within their government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.
*   **Slovenia:** Working on specific topics like the future of the public sector, talent management, and aging within the public sector for the EU presidency, within a context of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>.
*   **Latvia:** Focusing on technological development, building and managing anticipatory ecosystems around different technologies from a public sector perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>.

## Anticipation vs. Other Concepts

*   **Resilience:** While [[anticipatory innovation and foresight | anticipatory innovation]] can feed into resilience, it is not the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. Resilience aims to make a system prepared for external shocks so it can expand but not break, upholding its core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. Anticipation, however, can reveal when resilience is no longer sufficient and fundamental change is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
*   **Adaptation/Agility:** Tactical and adaptive responses are necessary during crises, involving quick action and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. However, this differs from [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic thinking]]. [[Anticipatory innovation and foresight | Anticipatory innovation]] strengthens resilient and adaptive capacities by helping determine the right direction and whether fundamental system changes are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.
*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation:** This is driven by a single, agreed-upon purpose or goal, such as decarbonizing the economy by a specific date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>. It legitimizes and drives innovation towards that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>. However, [[anticipatory innovation and foresight | anticipatory innovation]] is crucial for addressing the unexpected side effects of missions (e.g., job displacement from green transitions) and preventing being locked into a single solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

## How to Become an Anticipatory Organization

Becoming an [[Anticipatory Innovation in the Public Sector | anticipatory organization]] starts with making the case for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. This includes:
*   **Building Leadership Capacity:** Developing the ability for leaders to think about futures, foresight, and anticipatory issues, and to make decisions that support [[Anticipatory Innovation in the Public Sector | anticipatory innovation]] projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.
*   **Exploring Options and Testing:** Taking information from identified risks and opportunities (from foresight systems) and actively exploring different options on the ground through innovative practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>.
*   **Understanding Roles and Capacities:** Analyzing what roles are needed within the system (e.g., centralized vs. decentralized ministerial or departmental capacities) to respond to the pace of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **Autonomy and Linkages:** Providing autonomy to critical thinking teams whose job is to challenge the main organization's business-as-usual practices, while also establishing linkages to ensure learnings from practice are integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Measurement and Evaluation
[[Anticipatory innovation for governments | Anticipatory innovation]] requires a different type of measurement and evaluation system than standard public sector approaches, especially as it involves making decisions and taking actions without immediate evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a>.

## Tools and Methods for Foresight/Anticipation
Key tools and methods used in [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] and [[anticipatory innovation for governments | anticipatory innovation]] include:
*   Trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>
*   Scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>
*   Horizon Scanning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>
*   Visioning and Backcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>
*   Causal Layered Analysis (good for unearthing values and beliefs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>
*   Emerging Technology Assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>

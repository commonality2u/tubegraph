The **Gov-to-Gov Innovation Incubator** is a program designed to foster collaboration and learning among governments facing shared challenges, particularly concerning the effective use of data for policymaking and the development of evidence-based solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This initiative emphasizes the importance of government teams collaborating across borders to find positive solutions and share experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## The Innovation Incubator's Approach
The program adopts an experimental approach, creating a "safe space" for teams to exchange ideas, learn from each other, and come forward with challenges without fear of compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. It seeks to scale the impact of innovations by facilitating lesson learning and sharing ideas across borders, focusing on diversification rather than simple replication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. This also means starting from specific contexts, understanding that different places have unique populations, demographics, and landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.

A global exploration of 88 case studies of public sector incubators and accelerators revealed two key takeaways:
*   International borders still hinder collaboration between governments, a barrier that is less prevalent in other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   There is a clear need to strengthen cross-border collaboration by creating shared platforms, given that many challenges are transversal or very similar across different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

The incubator aims to transform these "blind spots" of impaired government collaboration into "sweet spots" by focusing specifically on overcoming such obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The program promotes government-to-government (G2G) innovation by matching governments with similar innovation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Challenges and Solutions in Data Utilization
The program focuses on four key challenges, with participating countries and organizations sharing their experiences and solutions:

### Challenge 1: Promoting Broader and More Equitable Digital Participation (Brazil)
Brazil's challenge, led by the General Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic, is to improve access and inclusiveness for underrepresented and marginalized groups in digital participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. While their platform, Brazil Participa, has reached 1.4 million Brazilians, certain groups lack access due to infrastructure or digital literacy issues, particularly low-income groups and black people in urban peripheries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. Ensuring digital inclusiveness is crucial for equitable participation and reinforcing democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>. They integrate digital tools with in-person processes to leverage the best of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>.

**Solution Providers:**
*   **New York City's Civic Engagement Commission (NYC CEC):** This commission was founded in 2018 to create more participatory democratic processes, particularly through "The People's Money" participatory budgeting initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>. NYC CEC faced the challenge of engaging diverse communities, including foreign-born populations, over 800 languages spoken, and neighborhoods affected by systemic inequality or limited access to infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>. They partnered with over 100 community-based organizations to conduct 500+ workshops, engaging 12,000 people and collecting 4,000 ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>. Their expertise includes "train the trainer" methodologies, data collection and analysis, integrating offline and online engagements, and translating public input into policy recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>.

Their work is open-source, following the principle "public money is public code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:07">[01:43:07]</a>.

### Challenge 4: Improving Accessibility to Public Services for Vulnerable Populations (Spain)
The Regional Government of Andalusia, Spain, aims to improve accessibility to public services for people in vulnerable situations or at risk of exclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:32">[01:43:32]</a>. Their multidisciplinary team focuses on a digital transformation strategy that prioritizes citizens and their life moments, ensuring services are digital by default but without leaving anyone behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>. Specific target groups include Andalusians at risk of social exclusion, people with disabilities, elderly individuals living alone, and those in remote rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:28">[01:45:28]</a>. The strategy involves removing access barriers, especially for electronic services, and building a comprehensive assistance network by utilizing existing peripheral centers (e.g., agricultural offices, medical centers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a>.

**Solution Providers:**
*   **Government Lab (Chile):** The Chilean Government Lab, a state agency under the Ministry of Finance since 2015, drives public innovation by co-creating solutions to priority public issues and measuring innovation capacities within institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:12">[01:48:12]</a>. Their approach is guided by five principles: people at the center, a multi-dimensional approach, co-creation, evidence-based solutions, and implementation-oriented projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:08">[01:49:08]</a>. An example is the electronic family pocket project, which provides a financial benefit through a user-friendly digital platform to help families manage food costs, improving flexibility and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>.
*   **Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC):** ESDC and its partners are responsible for delivering most federal government services to Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:26">[01:51:26]</a>. They are committed to understanding and reducing barriers for marginalized and underserved populations, such as children, low-income seniors, rural communities, and Indigenous communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. ESDC has worked to move towards a more [[inclusive_services_and_public_policy_making | inclusive and accessible digital service model]], focusing on improving the use of knowledge and data to understand client needs and identify those at risk of digital exclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:03">[01:53:03]</a>. Initiatives include targeted outreach ("Reaching All Canadians"), extensive research on marginalized populations, and reducing program barriers for non-governmental organizations involved in service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a>.

## Cohort-Based Learning Track
In addition to the main incubator, a parallel cohort-based learning track offers an opportunity for 30 government teams worldwide to collaborate on specific innovation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. This track is anchored on five thematic sessions, including:
*   Open experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>
*   Cultural transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>
*   Citizen involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>
*   [[Evidenceinformed policymaking using strategic foresight | Evidence-based policymaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>
*   Scaling public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>

Teams learn from each other's novel ways of working, exchange resources, and share opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.

### Examples from the Cohort-Based Track:

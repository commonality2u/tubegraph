Public sector innovation is a driving force of change, though sometimes it requires a dedicated push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Innovation Incubator Program
The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), in collaboration with the European Commission, developed the Innovation Incubator Program to provide this push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This incubator helps countries explore more radical innovations and [[preparing_for_future_challenges_through_government_innovation | anticipate future changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Denmark, Romania, and Portugal participated in its pilot phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The program provides participating countries with:
*   International expert advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Peer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Co-design elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

## [[Anticipatory innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]]
[[Anticipatory innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] enables governments to take future-oriented action, allowing them to adopt a proactive stance towards societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Under the stewardship of the Innovation Incubator, Portugal developed the [[anticipatory_innovation_governance_framework | Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This kit is designed for public service servants and managers who are new to [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Its purpose is to introduce [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] in an easy-to-understand, assess, and use manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Dissemination and Tools
Sharing experiences among innovators is crucial for mutual learning and disseminating positive contributions to the broader community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. OPSI has partnered with Accelerate Estonia to help disseminate lessons learned from the Innovation Incubator experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Accelerate Estonia's mission is to accelerate Estonia by identifying societal problems and finding public-private partnerships that transform these problems into opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Together, OPSI and Accelerate Estonia have developed tools for incubating innovation projects, which governments can access on OPSI's website and adapt to their specific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## OPSI's Role
OPSI serves as the global forum for public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. It supports governments in understanding, testing, and embedding new initiatives to respond to societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, ultimately aiming to ensure that better services and policies contribute to better lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

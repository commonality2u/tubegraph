The world is changing rapidly, and the future is quite unpredictable, necessitating a proactive approach to navigate it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. [[Public sector and strategic foresight | Public sector]] organizations are challenged to understand where disruptions originate and where the world is headed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The ability to anticipate the future is crucial for public administration to become a learning organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## The Role of Strategic Foresight
[[Strategic foresight]] and futures thinking are essential tools for putting organizations into a position to anticipate what might happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. It encourages humility and ambition in exploring the uncertain future more systematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

Instead of starting from the present, a powerful approach involves imagining new futures and mobilizing stakeholders around those visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This means cultivating new approaches, new types of organizing, new leadership, and new thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Combining Design and Foresight
The combination of design methods and [[strategic foresight]] is powerful, allowing for immersion and exploration of future narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. It enables individuals to imagine themselves in the shoes of future citizens or decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This approach can be used to explore various scenarios, such as the future of healthcare, by creating tangible and aesthetic models of what a future experience might feel like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

[[Role of strategic foresight and experimentation | Experimentation]] and rehearsing the future are key principles for leading [[anticipatory innovation and futures thinking | innovation]] through design thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Collaboration and Co-Creation
[[Understanding and utilizing strategic foresight | Collaboration]] and co-design are vital, involving many decision-makers, experts, and citizens in exploring different futures and making decisions about strategies to pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Co-creating services with citizens is crucial, requiring the promotion of active citizenship and the creation of platforms for direct connection with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Expanding Thinking and Time Horizons
New thinking involves enhancing engagement with critical global challenges and expanding into new types of resources to think differently about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This "expansive thinking" goes beyond traditional design thinking by broadening perspectives during innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Organizations are now considering time horizons as long as 10,000 years or 300 years, with some working with timelines like 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This also includes thinking about closeness to people, values, cross-sectors, new digital dimensions, and even the nature of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Strategic Foresight in Government
The Singapore government utilizes [[strategic foresight]] to address drivers that will greatly transform the operating environment, focusing on capability development and structural processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. The practice of [[strategic foresight]] in Singapore predates the Center for Strategic Futures (CSF), with scenario planning being a strong, disciplined process since the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

### Dealing with Uncertainty and Change
Governments must acknowledge that not everyone shares the same understanding of the level of uncertainty and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. A key function of [[strategic foresight]] is "scouting" – detecting early signals of change and identifying emerging issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. Giving these emerging issues names, such as "gigs" or "human cloud" before terms like "gig economy" became common, helps decision-makers and policymakers start conversations and explore opportunities and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

Scouting must be done with discipline, protecting time and space for specific processes like scenario planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>. Scenario planning, despite being a methodical and often tedious process, serves as a great discipline and a way to "convert people" to future thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>.

### Challenging Incompatible Mindsets and Structures
[[Strategic foresight]] also serves as a "challenge function" to identify and address mindsets or structures incompatible with a desired future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

*   **Example 1: Space Force Uniforms** The criticism of camouflage uniforms for space force illustrates how current structures can be incompatible with futuristic rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Example 2: Smart Cities and Remote Work** Despite investing in smart city infrastructure, resistance to remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed mindsets incompatible with a smart city future where physical presence is not always required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.
*   **Example 3: Agile Practices and Procurement** While the rhetoric often supports agile ways of working, existing structures like public sector procurement processes can impede implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. [[Challenges and solutions in foresight implementation | Untangling these legacies]] is tedious but helps identify pain points before paralysis sets in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

To challenge these incompatibilities, it's important to help people imagine and immerse themselves in the future. Storytelling through scenarios can create empathy and a lived experience of a vastly different future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.

### Playing the Long Game
Recognizing that change and uncertainty are constants, [[strategic foresight]] encourages "playing the long game" in the [[public sector and strategic foresight | public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. This involves:

*   **Growing Capabilities** Building the capability to think about the future and understanding the value of foresight functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. This combines formal training in tools with hands-on experience, as many believe true futures thinking is learned by doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.
*   **Building Communities of Practice** Creating communities of practice around foresight and [[anticipatory innovation and futures thinking | futures thinking]], contextualized to specific policy environments, encourages collaboration among public agencies to systematically think about future issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   **Developing People** Developing people through training and a "revolving door" policy where officers are trained in future thinking and then return to the system, creating advocates and multipliers for foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.

## Reframing Problems and Embracing Diversity
A key capability for dynamic and resilient public organizations is the ability to frame or reframe problems, moving them away from policy silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. This includes reframing issues like climate change beyond just energy to include food and clothing, or shifting from GDP to well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>. Since the future is constantly changing, the framing of problems must also adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

Openness is another crucial aspect, with public organizations becoming more open by design to engage with various stakeholders and viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>. This involves flatter, team-focused organizations and open digital infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>.

An emerging capability is the ethics of [[anticipatory innovation and futures thinking | innovation]], which involves civil servants considering their own ethics and biases while incorporating other people's perspectives in a space of radical uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.

Governments, traditionally backward-looking in analysis, need to build diversity into their analytical viewpoints to become more forward-looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. This means integrating ethnographic analysis alongside statistical and economic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>. These capabilities—reframing, ethics of innovation, and diversity of analytical viewpoints—are vital for making public organizations dynamic and resilient by design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.

### Challenging Entrenched Futures
Two deeply entrenched futures that should be challenged are:

1.  **Traditional Capitalism**: The idea of a market co-created by various actors should lead to a more radical rethinking of what kind of capitalism society wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.
2.  **The Growth Narrative**: The constant focus on GDP growth in government economic statements, despite its inability to address climate emergencies or inequality, needs to be debunked and rethought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.

The deep-seated paradigm of linearity and a technocentric belief in rationality, suggesting a future of continuous progression, has eroded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. Many generations now believe the future will be worse than the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>. Collective imagination is needed to build a more inclusive, circular, and connected economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>.

## Current Context and Future Opportunities
The COVID-19 pandemic has created a "liquefaction moment" where solid structures transform into liquid, presenting a critical opportunity to rethink and redesign the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. This moment allows for more radical change than previously thought possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

This period encourages a shift from human-centered design to "human-connected design," focusing on humans connected to each other, AI, infrastructure, places, and the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>. While governments tend to revert to command-and-control models during crises, this moment should be used to "smash up the jelly" and create a new form of governance that is open, collaborative, and creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

New "red lines" in government and new forms of governance are emerging, as fiscal possibilities are broader than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>. Demographic shifts, such as Generation X's retirement expectations or Millennials' career paths, can act as powerful forces for change, like a "fair wind behind your sail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

Small, targeted interventions, like a "trim tab" on a ship's rudder, can have a massive impact on complex systems, enabling large-scale turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>. This highlights the potential of [[anticipatory innovation and futures thinking | innovation]] labs, teams, or even individuals to drive significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>. The collective imagination needs to lead to seizing this moment to drive positive futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>.

[[Evidenceinformed policymaking using strategic foresight | Evidence-based policymaking]] and finding innovative solutions also require using data and analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

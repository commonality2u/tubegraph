Future-oriented governance is a critical topic, especially in the wake of recent global crises. This involves governments being willing and ready to learn from crises, take action to steer towards a better future, and build robust, adaptive systems for long-term challenges such as climate change and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>.

## Current State and Challenges
The past two decades have been marked by a series of crises, including the financial crisis, the sovereign debt crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:17">[03:30:17]</a>. During this period, public administration in many countries and regions was eroded, with limited opportunities for renewal, improvement, or training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This has led to a weakened public administration, particularly as experienced civil servants retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

Despite this challenging situation, there is an opportunity with new and strong funding available to boost recovery based on digital transformation, green initiatives, and a more cohesive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This presents a dual challenge: addressing a weakened public sector while managing new funding and evolving challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. New financial and technical support instruments, such as the EU's Technical Support Instrument and Recovery and Resilience Plans, offer possibilities to reshape and reorganize the civil service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

## Key Principles and Lessons Learned
According to the OECD Public Governance Committee, sound governance focuses on increasing trust in government by concentrating on three core areas:
1.  **The people governments serve** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
2.  **The workforce that serves them** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
3.  **The policies and routines that drive government culture** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated existing trends and offered several lessons for [[future_of_public_governance_postcovid19 | future public governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>:
*   **Whole-of-Government Approach**: The necessity to operate horizontally and avoid siloes across programs, budgets, and organizational structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Vertical Optimization**: The importance of listening and creating feedback mechanisms from frontline workers to senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. This includes gathering input from employees on their experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Adapting Policy-Making and Implementation Routines**: The need for frequent convening to adapt policies and approaches based on the experiences of the workforce, managers, and the public served <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Annual reviews are often too slow for the required pace of adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

## The Role of Innovation and Anticipation
The pandemic also triggered an undeniable surge in innovation within governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, including:
*   Increased uptake of digital government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   Rapid re-skilling and reallocation of public servants to urgent tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
*   Widespread teleworking among civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   Opening governments to ideas from the third sector to ensure service continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

To prepare for future challenges, particularly climate change, governments must carry forward this innovative momentum and systematically build the capacity of the public service to use innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. This involves:
*   Designing ambitious missions to tackle crises like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   Utilizing [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | creative foresight exercises]] to envision and build necessary skills and competencies in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   Pushing innovation beyond administrative boundaries and enhancing [[anticipatory_innovation_and_governance | cross-border collaboration]] for global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
*   Deliberately integrating inclusive policy design to build better policies and increase trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

## Addressing Inequality and Inclusion
Crises disproportionately affect different groups, often increasing inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. For example, young people have been particularly affected by the pandemic regarding employment, education, mental health, and access to services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. There is also a growing dissatisfaction among young people with how democracies function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.

To address this, countries need to integrate systematic approaches to gather diverse perspectives in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. Examples include:
*   The Netherlands' "generation check" to evaluate policy impact across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
*   Ensuring flexibility in decision-making mechanisms to accommodate minority voices and future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.
*   Focusing on inclusive governance, including better participation and representation, to strengthen democracy and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.

Governments must ensure that geographical location, social belonging, or generational gaps do not hinder access to basic public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>.

## Strengthening the Public Sector Workforce
A critical aspect of future-oriented governance is recognizing the public sector workforce as the most important resource and asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. Governments must prioritize supporting their employees, not just during crises but in day-to-day operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>.

## International Cooperation
Building a strong international cohort of leaders across public administration sectors can help build foresight and [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | innovation capacities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. The European Commission, for instance, provides technical support to member states and explores horizontal programs to exchange experiences and civil servants to create a common culture of public administration improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. Organizations like the OECD facilitate the exchange of know-how among countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.

## Commitment to Transformation
A poll conducted during the discussion revealed that while 42% of the audience is committed to implementing what they learned, only 32% believe governments are willing and ready to take action for a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. A significant 50% fear that lessons learned will not translate into concrete action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>, and 17.5% believe governments will revert to the "old normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. This highlights a concern about "short-termism" in government, particularly in addressing long-term problems like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

To be fit for the future, governments must:
*   Invest in the foundations of their governing systems to drive innovation and remain resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>.
*   Be ready to act at speed and scale when opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.
*   Prioritize investment in [[technological_advancements_in_governance | innovation]] to foresee and respond to complex global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.

The recovery from the COVID-19 crisis provides a unique opportunity to transform government action, organization, and operations, moving towards a future that holds equal opportunities for everyone, harnesses digital transformation, and addresses major challenges like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. Leaders are encouraged to challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of government with passion, courage, and tenacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.

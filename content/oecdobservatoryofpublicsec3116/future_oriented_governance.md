[[Anticipatory governance in government and technology | Future-oriented governance]] is a critical discussion point, especially given the series of crises governments have faced over the past two decades, including financial, sovereign, and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. These crises have often led to the erosion and weakening of public administrations, limiting their capacity for renewal, improvement, and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This situation presents a dual challenge: a generally weakened administrative "skeleton" alongside new demands for recovery based on digitalization, greening, and cohesive approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Despite these challenges, the current moment also offers significant opportunities for governments to reshape and strengthen their institutional capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This includes leveraging new financial and technical support instruments, such as the EU's Technical Support Instrument and Recovery and Resilience Plans, to modernize the civil service and manage new technologies effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. A strong institutional framework is seen as a precondition for convergence and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Lessons from the Pandemic for [[Future governance and leadership | Future-Oriented Governance]]

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated existing trends and offered several key lessons for [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>:

*   **Whole-of-Government Approach**
    Governments must operate horizontally, avoiding silos by programs, budgets, and organizational structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Policies, such as those concerning the future of work, cannot be developed in isolation but require cross-functional collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. This necessitates having the right skills and capabilities within central government to coordinate broad responses, as demonstrated by the frequent inter-agency coordination during COVID-19 response efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

*   **Listening to Front Lines**
    Historically, government focus has been on top-down compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. For [[future_governance_and_leadership | future-oriented governance]], there is a need to create feedback mechanisms so that frontline experiences are available to senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. An example is the US government's launch of a short, three-question pulse survey for nearly two million employees to understand workforce experiences during challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

*   **Adapting Policy and Implementation Routines**
    Governments need to frequently convene stakeholders to adapt policies and implementation approaches based on the experiences of the workforce, managers, and the public they serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. Annual policy adjustments are insufficient for the fluid nature of modern challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Furthermore, global challenges do not respect organizational boundaries, underscoring the importance of international partnerships and mechanisms for cross-border collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

## Pillars of [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]]

[[Innovative approaches to public governance | Innovation]] has seen an undeniable surge during the pandemic, including increased digital government uptake, rapid upskilling of public servants, and greater openness to ideas from the third sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Carrying this momentum forward requires systematically building the public service's capacity to use innovation for future challenges like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.

Key areas for [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] include:
*   **Designing Ambitious Missions** to tackle crises like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Using Creative Foresight Exercises** to envision and build necessary public sector skills and competencies for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
*   **Enhancing Cross-Border Collaboration** for global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   **Integrating Inclusive Policy Design** to build better policies for all and increase public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

## Addressing Inequalities and Promoting Inclusion

Crises disproportionately affect different population groups, often exacerbating inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. [[Future oriented governance | Future-oriented governance]] must rethink its tools to address these disparities, especially as more crises, such as those related to climate change, emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. Young people, in particular, have been heavily affected by the pandemic regarding employment, education, mental health, and access to services, leading to increased dissatisfaction with democratic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.

To combat this, countries need to:
*   **Integrate Systematic Approaches** to gather diverse perspectives in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. The Netherlands' "generation check" to evaluate policy impact across generations is an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
*   **Embrace Flexibility** in decision-making mechanisms to accommodate minority voices and future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.
*   **Improve How Democracy Delivers** by leveraging public stimulus packages, like Next Generation EU or the American Job Plan, to address climate change, digital transformation, and deep-rooted inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>.
*   **Promote Inclusive Governance** through better participation and representation, strengthening democracy and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.

Concerns exist that, while lessons may be learned, concrete actions might not be taken with sufficient energy, particularly for long-term problems like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. Governments tend to focus on short-term issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. Therefore, the challenge is to move from emergency responses to robust, [[future_governance_and_leadership | future-oriented strategies]] for long-term recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

## Key Focus Areas for [[Integrating strategic foresight into organization and governance | Integrating Strategic Foresight]]

*   **Digital Transformation:** Digitalization is central to the agenda, but it requires reshaping the entire administration, not just replicating old bureaucratic systems electronically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. This must impact central, regional, and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. Careful attention is needed to prevent a digital divide, ensuring that segments of the population are not cut off from basic public services due to location, capacity, or educational background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. A place-based approach is vital to manage this bottom-up effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

*   **Valuing the Public Workforce:** The pandemic highlighted the critical role of the public workforce during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. Governments must consistently recognize and support their workforce as their most important asset, not just during emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. This means leaders focusing on operational aspects and supporting frontline staff who directly interact with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

*   **International Cooperation:** Strengthening international cohorts of leaders and facilitating the exchange of know-how are crucial for building foresight and innovation capacities in public administration globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. The European Commission supports member states with technical assistance to implement good practices and is exploring horizontal programs to exchange experiences and even civil servants to foster a common culture of public administration improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.

## Call to Action for [[Technology foresight and governance | Technology Foresight and Governance]]

The COVID-19 recovery provides a unique opportunity to transform government action, organization, and operations, moving beyond the "old normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>. To be fit for the future, governments must invest now in the foundations of their governing systems to drive innovation, harness new opportunities, and remain resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>. This includes:
*   Prioritizing investment in innovation to foresee and respond to complex global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>.
*   Applying lessons learned from the pandemic to other pressing challenges, particularly the climate crisis and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.
*   Continuing to stimulate recovery with green objectives to green economies, societies, and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>.

Leaders are urged to step outside their comfort zones, challenge the status quo, and push the boundaries of government with passion, courage, and tenacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. The goal is to turn conversations into commitments and actions that pave the way for a public sector fit for the future, driving positive results for society and forging better policies for better lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.

Public servants frequently encounter diverse challenges, problems, and situations, none of which are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. [[innovation_tools_and_methods | Innovation tools or methods]] can provide new approaches and ways of working to address these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Challenge of Abundance

While there is no shortage of [[methods_and_tools_in_innovation_toolkits | innovation tools, toolkits, guides, and playbooks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, this abundance also presents a problem: knowing where or how to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. What is truly needed is a better filter or "compass" to guide users to the most appropriate resources for their innovation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The OPSI Toolkit Navigator: A Guiding Compass

To address this challenge, OPSI (Observatory of Public Sector Innovation) created the OPSI Toolkit Navigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This resource connects a specific situation, problem, or challenge to a relevant toolkit, helping users find their way and filtering out clutter to reveal a clearer path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Development Process

The OPSI Toolkit Navigator was developed in collaboration with hundreds of public servants and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> through a multi-step process:
1.  **Analysis and Organization** Hundreds of existing toolkits were analyzed and organized based on the actions they inform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  **Situation Exploration** The types of situations, problems, and challenges commonly faced by public servants were explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  **Conceptualization of Needs** Insights were gathered on how public servants typically articulate and conceptualize their desired actions or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
4.  **Navigational Path Design** Navigational path options were designed to link specific situations with appropriate tools, allowing the OPSI Toolkit Navigator to suggest tools based on desired actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Beyond Tool Selection

While finding the right tool is important, innovation involves more than just tool selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Therefore, the OPSI Toolkit Navigator also connects users to:
*   Skills and capacity-building resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Real-life case studies of innovation in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Fellow public servants and experts who have navigated similar paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Leadership plays a pivotal role in driving and sustaining [[innovation in the public sector | public sector innovation]], influencing an organization's culture, strategic direction, and ability to adapt to change. IP Australia's journey highlights several key aspects of effective leadership in this context.

## Setting the Strategic Direction
Effective leadership provides a clear vision and strategic roadmap for [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]]. At IP Australia, the predecessor Director-General, Patricia Kelly, was a pivotal person who led the organization's initial innovation approach [01:13:15]. This momentum from the leadership team was crucial [01:14:14]. The leadership team embraced the opportunity by adopting a clear vision and strategic plan, which included a "roadmap to 2030" incorporated into annual corporate plans [01:19:03], [01:19:07], [01:19:25], [01:19:31]. This long-term vision, using a "three horizons approach," set high-level "guardrails" that encourage experimentation and necessary "leaps" for the organization to achieve its ambitions [01:19:44], [01:19:58], [01:20:04], [01:20:08], [01:20:10], [01:20:13]. This strategic clarity ensures [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] is not an afterthought but an integral part of the organization's direction [01:21:18], [01:21:20], [01:21:23], [01:21:28], [01:21:29], [01:21:31], [01:21:33].

## Fostering a Culture of Innovation and Risk-Taking
Leadership is essential in cultivating a culture that embraces [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] and accepts calculated risks. The capability review, which suggested an increased embrace of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]], was championed by Patricia Kelly and her executive team [01:14:03], [01:14:06], [01:14:09], [01:14:11]. This leadership commitment was vital for establishing staff ideas and encouraging proactive approaches [01:15:35], [01:15:39], [01:16:00], [01:16:05].

A key aspect of this cultural shift was the explicit commitment to dedicate a small percentage (less than 1%) of the annual budget specifically to [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] for experimentation, technology, and ideas [01:16:52], [01:16:57], [01:17:01], [01:17:06], [01:17:19], [01:17:23]. This financial backing demonstrated an acceptance that some initiatives might fail but would still provide valuable lessons [01:17:29], [01:17:33], [01:17:35]. The leadership's acceptance of risk, coupled with agile methodologies, helped identify failures quickly and manage the experimentation process [01:33:56], [01:33:59], [01:34:02], [01:34:04], [01:30:54], [01:31:16], [01:31:21], [01:31:24], [01:31:28].

## Adapting to Unforeseen Challenges
The groundwork laid by leadership in fostering a flexible and innovative environment proved crucial during the COVID-19 crisis. Prior investments in activity-based working, IT infrastructure (laptops, Wi-Fi, audio-visual equipment), flexible workplace arrangements, and cultural change (discouraging managers from insisting on constant physical presence) enabled a rapid shift to remote work [01:38:10], [01:38:15], [01:38:17], [01:38:21], [01:38:40], [01:38:45], [01:39:20], [01:39:24], [01:39:26], [01:39:28], [01:39:31], [01:39:40], [01:39:46], [01:39:53], [01:40:00], [01:40:03], [01:40:05].

The organization scaled from 100 people working remotely to 1,000 in one week, largely due to a strong trust relationship with staff and managers' ability to lead remote teams [01:40:24], [01:40:27], [01:40:32], [01:40:34], [01:41:54], [01:41:57], [01:42:02], [01:42:06], [01:42:09], [01:42:37], [01:42:40]. The Director-General expressed gratitude for the predecessor's decisions and the team's execution that placed the agency in a strong position for the crisis [01:42:50], [01:42:59], [01:43:02], [01:43:04].

This experience instilled confidence in the organization's ability to adapt and perform during unexpected events [01:43:45], [01:43:48]. It reinforced the importance of scenario planning and strategic risk management, lessons learned from previous events like the H1N1 pandemic that led to a national pandemic plan [01:45:55], [01:45:57], [01:46:02], [01:46:05], [01:46:09], [01:46:12], [01:44:07], [01:44:11], [01:44:14], [01:44:16], [01:44:19], [01:44:23].

## Communication and Persistence
Leaders must effectively communicate the strategic direction, mission, and appetite for risk to all staff [01:47:30], [01:47:31], [01:47:36], [01:47:40], [01:47:43], [01:47:47], [01:47:50], [01:47:53], [01:48:19], [01:48:24], [01:48:25], [01:48:29]. This involves layering communication, from high-level vision to specific examples, to ensure technical staff can explain complex ideas to non-technical colleagues [01:49:00], [01:49:02], [01:49:05], [01:49:08], [01:49:40], [01:49:42], [01:49:45], [01:49:48], [01:49:52], [01:49:53], [01:51:24], [01:51:27], [01:51:29].

Sustaining [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] also requires persistence and an understanding that organizational change is complex and takes time [01:18:22], [01:18:32], [01:19:44], [01:19:48]. Leaders must accept that people move at different paces and that success is not as simple as a conductor waving a baton [01:19:09], [01:19:11], [01:19:18], [01:19:22], [01:19:26], [01:19:29], [01:19:30]. The strategic roadmap, as a common touchstone, has been instrumental in steering the organization through various challenges [01:20:26], [01:20:31], [01:20:36], [01:20:39], [01:20:42], [01:20:44], [01:20:47], [01:20:49], [01:20:51], [01:20:53], [01:20:54], [01:20:58], [01:21:02], [01:21:05], [01:21:06]. The ongoing challenge is to refresh this roadmap and continuously evolve the "three horizons" to prevent complacency and prepare for future scenarios [01:05:11], [01:05:14], [01:05:20], [01:05:23], [01:05:25], [01:05:27], [01:05:30], [01:05:32], [01:05:33], [01:05:36], [01:05:40], [01:05:44], [01:05:47], [01:05:50], [01:05:52], [01:05:55], [01:06:00], [01:06:02], [01:06:04], [01:06:08], [01:06:11], [01:06:13], [01:06:16], [01:06:19].

## Leadership for Bottom-Up Initiatives
Leaders also empower staff to drive [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] from the bottom up. For young people with technical backgrounds, it is crucial to understand the "bosses' concerns" (strategic objectives, strategic risks) and frame proposed [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] within that context [01:13:17], [01:13:19], [01:13:23], [01:13:27], [01:13:30], [01:13:32], [01:13:34], [01:13:35], [01:13:37], [01:13:39], [01:13:45], [01:13:50].

Advice for bottom-up innovators:
*   Don't oversell ideas [01:13:54], [01:14:01].
*   Be prepared to "fail fast" [01:14:01], [01:14:07].
*   Be open to evaluation and explain risks transparently [01:14:10], [01:14:14].
*   Avoid hiding problems, as trying to "kill a project" when it should have been stopped is difficult [01:14:20], [01:14:26], [01:14:30], [01:14:33], [01:14:35], [01:14:39].
*   Possess strong communication skills [01:15:09], [01:15:11], [01:15:15].
*   Do homework, talk to customers and stakeholders, and bring evidence [01:15:21], [01:15:23], [01:15:25], [01:15:26].

A successful example is a young public servant who, after talking to local innovators, proposed an ongoing collaboration. This initiative, framed within the agency's strategic directions, demonstrated a "bottom-up grassroots adoption" of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] and has grown into a valuable practice [01:15:31], [01:15:34], [01:15:36], [01:15:41], [01:15:43], [01:15:47], [01:15:48], [01:15:53], [01:15:56], [01:15:59], [01:16:03], [01:16:05], [01:16:08], [01:16:10], [01:16:13], [01:16:16], [01:16:20], [01:16:24], [01:16:30], [01:16:34], [01:16:39], [01:16:43], [01:16:46], [01:16:49], [01:16:53].

## Continuous Evolution
While IP Australia has achieved significant success, the role of leadership in [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] remains ongoing. Future steps include refreshing the strategic roadmap to ensure continuous evolution and prevent stagnation [01:05:11], [01:05:14], [01:05:20], [01:05:23], [01:05:25], [01:05:27], [01:05:30], [01:05:32]. Building people's confidence in risk management and fostering a culture of risk maturity across all levels of the organization is also crucial [01:06:28], [01:06:30], [01:06:32], [01:06:35], [01:06:37], [01:06:40], [01:06:43], [01:06:47], [01:06:51], [01:06:53], [01:06:57], [01:07:00], [01:07:04], [01:07:07], [01:07:09], [01:07:13], [01:07:16], [01:07:17], [01:07:18], [01:07:22], [01:07:24], [01:07:26], [01:07:29], [01:07:31], [01:07:32]. The leadership's sustained appetite for risk is vital in this process [01:07:46], [01:07:50], [01:07:52]. IP Australia has also invested in staff development to enhance skills in [[Developing Leadership Skills for Public Sector Innovation | innovation]], risk, and communication, which are now front and center of expectations for all staff [01:08:12], [01:08:15], [01:08:19], [01:08:21], [01:08:27], [01:08:32], [01:08:35], [01:09:18], [01:09:21], [01:09:24].

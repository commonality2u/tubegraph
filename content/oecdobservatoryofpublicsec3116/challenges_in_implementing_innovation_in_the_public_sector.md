Defining [[innovation in general is quite difficult]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, as it pertains to novelty and new things that did not exist before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While the private sector offers a more understood context for innovation, the public sector presents unique complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Distinguishing Private and Public Sector Innovation

In the private sector, [[innovation in the public sector|innovation]] involves something new that is implemented within a market context, aiming for a firm to gain a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This could be a new service, process, product, or any new thinking applied to achieve a direct market proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

However, in the public sector, the situation becomes more complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. [[Public sector innovation challenges|Public sector innovation]] should still be defined by novelty â€“ things that are new to a specific context, whether they are new thinking, services, or otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Critically, these innovations must be implemented and applied, not merely discussed inventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. They need to be new thinking, services, or processes that have had an actual impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## [[Challenges in implementing innovation]]

The primary [[Challenges in Public Sector Innovation|challenges in the public sector]] stem from the absence of a market feedback system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

*   **Lack of Competitive Advantage Metric**
    Unlike the private sector, the public sector cannot measure success by competitive advantage because the government is typically the sole provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Instead, [[innovation in the public sector management|innovation in the public sector]] should contribute to a change in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Potential for Negative or Unintended Impacts**
    Innovations do not always have purely positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For example, while digital advancements might offer quicker services to many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, they can inadvertently exclude parts of the population that lack access to digital tools or the capability to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Therefore, [[innovation in public sector]] can be both beneficial and detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Ultimately, [[innovation in public sector]] is defined by new things implemented in a new context that bring some form of value to the population they serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

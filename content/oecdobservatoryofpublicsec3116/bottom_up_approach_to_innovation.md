A bottom-up approach to innovation is closely linked with [[understanding_adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]], which focuses on [[the_discovery_process_in_innovation | the discovery process]] itself without clear predetermined goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach encourages the exploration of new ideas and the discovery of what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Core Principles

The bottom-up approach provides allowance and room for new ideas to emerge from those closest to the people or the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This perspective allows individuals to:
*   **Explore new ideas** on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Draw upon signals** from citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Innovate accordingly** or test out experiments based on feedback from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

This method is crucial for the emergence of truly new ideas, as it moves beyond existing paradigms and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Innovations stemming from this approach can either become useful enhancements to current services or challenge existing systems altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Both transformative and enhancement-oriented innovations can emerge from such adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Example in Practice

In Canada, a bottom-up approach led to civil servants developing applications "by the side of their desk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These apps aimed to make the regulatory system more easily understandable and usable for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Instead of simplifying regulation, the focus shifted to making it comprehensible for clients, for example, by clarifying regulations applicable to establishing a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This direct, user-centric innovation emerged from the adaptive nature of a bottom-up approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

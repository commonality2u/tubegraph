The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a global surge in innovation across the public sector, highlighting the critical role of agile and adaptable governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) has been actively tracking these [[innovation in response to crisis | innovative responses]] worldwide, collecting over 250 examples of varying scope and originality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:38">[08:47:38]</a>. This period has demonstrated that public governance matters, emphasizing the need for robust systems that can handle both short-term emergencies and long-term recovery and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">[03:00:10]</a>.

## Drivers of Innovation During Crisis

The crisis has proven to be conducive for innovation, often accelerating changes that were already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:11">[03:08:11]</a>. Key factors influencing this surge in [[public sector innovation during Covid19 | public sector innovation]] include:
*   **Clarity:** The overriding message that change is necessary and innovation is clearly needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:50">[03:21:50]</a>.
*   **Parity:** New options are given equal footing with existing solutions, as old methods often prove inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Suitability:** Investment and support for new ways of working and thinking have dramatically increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Normality:** Trying unusual approaches becomes perfectly normal, even expected, during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

This period has shown that innovation is not a luxury but a necessity, increasing the legitimacy of public sector innovation in the eyes of many governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## Types of Innovative Responses

The range of innovative activities observed includes:
*   **Structural Responses and Longer-Term Shifts:** For example, rescue packages for national airlines including climate change ambitions as a condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
*   **Solidarity Platforms:** Governments and non-governmental organizations making it easier for people to volunteer and support communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.
*   **Hackathons and Challenges:** Pan-European hackathons and government challenges to develop novel responses quickly, with some ideas, like those from Lithuania, implemented rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.
*   **Service Delivery Adjustments:** A lot of digital transformation, including virtual weddings and distant wedding registrations, showcasing the crisis's impact on human activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.
*   **Legislative Adaptations:** Legislatures adopting virtual meetings to continue their role in scrutinizing the executive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   **Infection Control and Tracking:** Development of various apps and measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Resources:** Redeploying available capacities, such as airline stewards in Sweden trained to support the health network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   **Improved Communications:** Providing targeted information, special declarations for children (e.g., New Zealand's Easter Bunny as an essential worker, Portugal's Co for Kids platform), and imaginative educational tools (e.g., China's 1-meter distance hats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

## Country-Specific Examples

### Portugal
Portugal's innovative responses have been categorized into a three-fold approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>:
*   **Inside-Out:** The state responding to new demands. An example is the "We are on it" hub, a single point of contact (a large portal) providing reliable, up-to-date information on legal initiatives and public services, and direct access to digital services via the ePortugal portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>. This portal also provides companies with access to support programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.
*   **Outside-In:** Civil society organizing to provide solutions and challenge the state. The "Tech for [[covid19_responses_and_government_adaptability | COVID-19]]" platform, a community of over 5,000 professionals, offers solutions like free online consultations, apps for remote work, and platforms to help local businesses sell online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.
*   **Within:** Collaborative initiatives within the state. A collaborative work plan for public administration led to 22 projects involving 27 public entities and civil society organizations. These projects included a guide for leadership in crisis, promoting innovation through an "Innovation Barometer," and disseminating information strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. The crisis acted as a trigger to accelerate the delivery of the state and coordinate public entities' efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>.

### Denmark
Denmark's crisis response has been somewhat mild, with relatively low case numbers and deaths, but has seen significant innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>:
*   **Communication:** The Prime Minister held press conferences for children, and the government used influencers to reach diverse audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation:** Denmark experienced a "quantum leap" in digital transformation, building on its already strong digital infrastructure where 86% of the population interacted with government digitally in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>. Scaling capacity for remote work was a major focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>. Tools like Microsoft Teams, previously met with skepticism, became essential during lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[25:56:00]</a>.
*   **Service and Product Innovations:** Rapid implementation of technologies like video consultations with GPs and chatbots for [[Government response to the Covid19 crisis | COVID-19]] questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>. Some municipalities developed local e-commerce platforms to support local shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>. Libraries are exploring becoming "libraries in the cloud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>.
*   **Collaboration:** Significant cross-sector collaboration emerged, including companies and volunteers 3D printing face shields. The health system, traditionally fragmented between regional hospitals and municipal home care, saw unprecedented collaboration, leading to calls for structural reform based on these "proof of concepts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>.
*   **Citizen-Centric Digital Communication:** Moving beyond simple digital versions of paper documents (like "digital post"), social workers used platforms like Signal to reach young people who don't use email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.

### South Africa
South Africa's response highlighted context-specific innovations and the repurposing of existing capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:04:00">[29:04:00]</a>:
*   **Contextual Adaptation:** Examples from Africa include Rwanda's rapid rollout of handwashing facilities at public transport hubs and Ghana repurposing zipline drone vaccine deliveries for test kits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a>.
*   **Repurposing Existing Programs:** Leveraging experience with epidemics like HIV, TB, malaria, and Ebola. Community health workers trained in these areas were rapidly deployed for [[government_responses_to_covid19 | COVID-19]] screening and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a>. Existing tuberculosis testing machines were repurposed for [[Government responses to COVID19 | COVID-19]] diagnostics, especially in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:01:00">[30:01:00]</a>.
*   **Public Trust and Communication:** Campaigns like "#ListenToTheDoctors" encouraged citizens to trust experts. Daily videos from doctors and regular briefings from the Minister of Health with technical experts helped build trust and convey complex information to the public, including messages targeted at children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Innovation

### Ambiguity of Crisis
The crisis presents an ambiguous situation for innovation:
*   **Easier Aspects:** The urgent need for action solves the problem of inertia, compelling immediate practice of innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:16:00">[42:16:00]</a>. It magnifies the value that innovation brings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>. The crisis has confirmed the reality and activity of the innovation ecosystem, facilitating collaborative sharing of knowledge and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>. It also provided a huge occasion to demonstrate the criticality of public governance and the state's ability to overcome challenges and provide a powerful reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:18:00">[44:18:00]</a>.
*   **Harder Aspects:** Crisis mode can lead to centralization of decision-making, which might be too far removed from the frontline context and possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>. Innovation work unrelated to [[government_response_to_the_covid19_crisis | COVID-19]] has likely taken a back burner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>. Specialization can lead to siloing, where innovations in one sector (e.g., health) don't easily translate to others (e.g., social services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:04:00">[39:04:00]</a>. Competency in using appropriate tools for innovation has been problematic at the organizational level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35:00">[39:35:00]</a>.

### Managing Different Timeframes
Governments must operate across immediate, recovery, and long-term horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:37:00">[51:37:00]</a>. The crisis has exposed the insufficiency of normal planning processes for dealing with complex, recurring crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:19:00">[52:19:00]</a>. This forces a rethinking and reimagining of the public service and economy. Many officials are intuitively adopting a scenario approach for short, medium, and long terms, allowing for anticipatory governance and [[resilience and innovation in pandemic response | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[52:50:00]</a>.

Key considerations for managing innovation across timeframes:
*   **Counteracting Presentism:** While quick, pragmatic answers are necessary, there's a risk of a "tunnel effect" where focus on immediate solutions ignores other ongoing crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:51:00">[59:51:00]</a>. The need to make solutions sustainable and regular is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>.
*   **Building a New Normal:** Instead of a "nostalgia of normality," the crisis underscores the need to build a new, better normal, driven by urgency rather than mere aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Blame Games and Magical Thinking:** The crisis often leads to finger-pointing, which hinders rational problem-solving. It's crucial to avoid the "wishful thinking" that the crisis will magically solve all problems and instead embrace experimental approaches to manage risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.
*   **Balancing Expertise and Public Debate:** While medical and technological solutions are powerful, they are not a substitute for public debate and citizen engagement in shaping the new normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Data and Reinvesting in Ecosystems:** Use evidence-based decision-making by triangulating qualitative and quantitative data, and analyze the vast amounts of data generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. Public administrations should reinvest in the innovation ecosystem, maintaining bidirectional transit with external stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Use, Not Just Output:** Many good innovations might not be used or sustained. It's vital to understand why and ensure solutions are user-centered and inclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.
*   **Responsible Innovation and Experimentation:** Innovating means thinking about consequences, anticipating what can be desired and undesired. Foresight and anticipatory methodologies are crucial. Experimentation allows for testing, learning from failures, and reducing risk before widespread implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.

### Digital Transformation
The [[government innovation during COVID19 | COVID-19 crisis]] has spurred a significant "quantum leap" in digital transformation across governments, even in countries with already high digital adoption rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This has fundamentally disrupted digital work habits and accelerated the adoption of virtual working tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. However, it also highlights challenges like the digital divide and the risk of exacerbating existing inequalities if digital services are not inclusively designed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:59">[01:04:59]</a>.

### Social Inequalities
The crisis has exposed and potentially magnified social inequalities. Municipalities struggling before [[COVID19 responses and government adaptability | COVID-19]] have been hit harder, as seen in unemployment rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Governments must ensure that innovative responses, particularly digital ones, do not further penalize vulnerable populations lacking internet access or digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:59">[01:04:59]</a>.

## The Future of Public Sector Innovation

The crisis serves as a huge laboratory and an accelerator for a paradigm shift in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>. It has demonstrated the public administration's extraordinary capacity for adaptation and response to unprecedented challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>. This adaptive capability is built upon a long, silent, and gradual accumulation of small changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>.

To sustain positive changes and move towards a "new normal," several actions are critical:
*   **Legitimacy and Dialogue:** Continuously legitimize discussions about learning from the crisis and questioning what needs to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
*   **User Involvement:** Leaders should involve users and adopt design thinking to push for sustained change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>.
*   **Highlighting Successes:** Document and emphasize stories of successful "new normal" practices to push them up the management chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>.
*   **Institutional Strengthening:** Beyond individual innovation, there's a need to strengthen institutional environments to enable innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. Innovation must be brought on par with other governmental priorities to drive systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>.
*   **Collective Resonance:** Harness the "collective resonance" felt during the crisis, where citizens and public servants attuned to each other's needs, to foster a more participatory state and collaborative models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>.
*   **"Dirty Hands" Approach:** Moving from "innovation theater" to practical, hands-on innovation and experimentation, essential for navigating future crises like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>.

Ultimately, the crisis is not an end but the beginning of something new, requiring a continuous dialogue to balance a desire to return to the old normal, retain new successful prototypes, and seize the opportunity for radical, systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:35">[01:23:35]</a>. The problems created by the pandemic, such as social impacts on employment, will require continued creative and [[Government responses to COVID19 and lessons learned | innovative solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>. The [[role of Government after COVID19 | role of government]] in fostering innovation needs to evolve from command-and-control to a more socially active way of managing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

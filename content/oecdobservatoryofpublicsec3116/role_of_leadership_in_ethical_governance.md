The effectiveness of governance, particularly in preventing corruption and fostering public integrity, is significantly influenced by the [[Role of Leadership in Ethical Governance | role of leadership]]. Recent research and practical application of behavioral science insights highlight how leadership can shape the ethical environment within public administration, encouraging accountability and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

## Slovak Republic Project Context

A four-year project, a partnership between Slovakia and the OECD, aimed to improve capacities in the Slovak public administration to reinforce integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This initiative involved analytical work and direct engagement with civil servants to implement integrity measures and develop concrete tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Key areas of focus included:
*   Incorporating a strategic approach to inform integrity policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   Improving horizontal coordination across integrity functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   Engaging the whole of society in integrity efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   Applying a behavioral risk-based approach to corruption prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

An Integrity Review of the Slovak Republic, published in 2022, revealed that while measures to strengthen corruption risk management were in place, their practical application lagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. This challenge is common across many OECD countries, where frameworks exist but consistent and coherent application struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Slovakia actively engaged in exploring innovative ways to improve corruption risk management, including applying behavioral insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

The project aligns with the OECD Recommendation on Public Integrity, launched in 2017, which provides a strategic approach to fighting corruption by shifting focus from ad hoc policies to a context-dependent, behavioral risk-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. This recommendation also stresses the importance of cultivating a culture of integrity across all societal stakeholders, including public servants, businesses, civil society organizations, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

## Behavioral Insights in Anti-Corruption Policy

Behavioral insights (BI) play a crucial role in [[Role of Leadership in Ethical Governance | integrity policy]] by:
*   **Supporting [[Ethical Considerations | ethical choices]]**: Most people possess a moral compass and strive to act with integrity, even when unobserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. Policy should empower these officials and create an environment that supports [[Ethical Considerations | ethical choices]], or an "open culture of integrity," where staff feel comfortable discussing ethical concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
*   **Ensuring effective implementation of integrity policies**: BI helps overcome assumptions about how policies will be implemented, considering the real behaviors of public officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

### Identifying Barriers to Reporting

The project aimed to understand how to prevent corruption in the Slovak public administration, specifically focusing on empowering public sector employees to detect and report corruption risks safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. Through focus groups and interviews with anti-corruption coordinators and public officials, several behavioral barriers were identified:
*   **"Ticking the Box" Behavior**: Managers formally adhere to procedures but don't act in line with the code of conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
*   **Culture of Silence**: Employees often do not speak up about corruption risks due to a culture of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Leadership by Example**: Leaders themselves often fail to speak up about corruption risks, setting a poor example for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:15]</a>.
*   **Limited Understanding of Channels**: Employees may be aware of risks but don't know how or where to report them, or are unaware of existing channels like electronic surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.
*   **Psychological Costs**: Perception of retaliation and lack of feedback mechanisms discourage reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.

The study specifically narrowed its focus to employees not speaking up about **potential corruption risks**, not just incidents, as this is where the line is often blurred and reporting is less clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.

### Experiment Design and Findings

A randomized vignette experiment was conducted with 2,537 respondents from line Ministries and central authorities in Slovakia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:33:00">[30:33:00]</a>. The experiment tested two interventions targeting specific barriers:
1.  **Understanding a Risk**: Provided an analogy from health (speaking to a doctor about risk factors like smoking to diagnose cancer) to make corruption risks easier to grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Exemplary [[Role of Leadership in Ethical Governance | Leadership]]**: Presented a scenario where a manager leads by example, raising hiring risks and encouraging colleagues to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a>.

Both messages also applied injunctive social norms, reminding participants that every civil servant should be honest and speak about risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>.

#### Key Results:
*   In the control group (no intervention), only 48% of respondents were likely to communicate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47:00">[31:47:00]</a>.
*   The **[[Role of Leadership in Ethical Governance | leadership]] message was most impactful**, increasing the likelihood of communicating a risk by approximately 14 percentage points compared to the control group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29:00">[33:29:00]</a>.
*   The "understanding of risks" message increased the likelihood by approximately 9 percentage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[33:42:00]</a>.
*   Younger respondents were more likely to communicate a corruption risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>. An increase in age by one year decreased the likelihood by 0.23 percentage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:00">[34:27:00]</a>. This could be due to a greater fear of retaliation or "status quo bias" among more senior staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>.
*   Career length was not found to correlate with the likelihood of reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>.
*   People generally felt safer communicating a risk after being asked whom they would prefer to report to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>. They significantly preferred reporting to their managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:00">[35:52:00]</a>.
*   Trust in the risk management system correlated with feeling safe and being more likely to communicate corruption risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:00">[36:58:00]</a>.

## Recommendations and Future Outlook

Based on these findings, three main axes of work are recommended for Slovakia, particularly as they formulate a new National Anti-Corruption Strategy for 2024-2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:41:00">[38:41:00]</a>:

1.  **Empower [[Role of Leadership in Ethical Governance | Leaders]] to Set the Standard**: The experiment confirmed that when leaders set the example, employees follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:20:00">[39:20:00]</a>. Providing training for leaders to equip them with the knowledge, skills, and resources to act with integrity is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35:00">[39:35:00]</a>. Anti-corruption coordinators also have a key role in this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:52:00">[39:52:00]</a>.
2.  **Make Risk Communication Easy and Well Understood**: Policies should be designed to align with how people behave, such as their preference to report to managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>. Awareness of existing reporting channels (e.g., electronic surveys) must be raised, and clear, concise, and behaviorally informed guidelines should be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:02:00">[41:02:00]</a>.
3.  **Cultivate a Culture of Safety**: Feelings of safety are a key enabler for people to speak up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>. This involves making it a social norm to report and ensuring mechanisms are in place that demonstrate action is taken when risks are reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.

Experts agree that this project exemplifies how behavioral approaches can support policymaking, providing concrete lines of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. The use of vignettes and randomized assignments helps establish a causal connection between interventions and behavioral changes, highlighting the significant impact that subtle changes in communication can have on sensitive issues like corruption reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:57:00">[45:57:00]</a>.

The study is an ambitious first step, opening avenues for future research and larger-scale real-world experiments to further test interventions in different public administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. Ensuring that reported risks lead to actual mitigation measures is the crucial next step for these efforts to be effective and build sustained [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:42">[01:24:42]</a>. Education on integrity and risk management should also start earlier, at universities and high schools, to cultivate a more integrity-conscious society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

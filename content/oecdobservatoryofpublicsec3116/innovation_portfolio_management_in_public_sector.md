A recent panel discussion explored [[portfolio_exploration_for_public_sector_innovation | innovation portfolio approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) is actively working on a portfolio assessment tool for public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Background and Need for Innovation Portfolios in Public Sector

In general, policy and [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] projects within governments often adopt a layered approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This means there isn't always a systematic method for policy design or [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Findings from OECD countries show that policies and [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] projects are often layered on top of each other, without a comprehensive view of their collective outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

A fundamental concept being introduced to the public sector is that not all [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] is the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Different [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation activities]] exist in parallel or synergy, but it's often difficult to see how they interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This highlights the need for a more portfolio-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

OPSI's thinking on portfolios begins with the *purpose* of [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>:
*   To do things better in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   To capture emerging possibilities that may fundamentally change operations, as seen during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   To achieve goals and solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   To respond to environmental changes and evolving societal/technological situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The public sector inherently operates with an [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | innovation portfolio]], whether intentional or not, as it constantly innovates to address these core questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This portfolio often includes a mix of mission-oriented, enhancement-oriented, adaptive, and anticipatory [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] projects and programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The challenge is to manage these diverse portfolios effectively and systematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, recognizing that different types of [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] (e.g., mission-oriented vs. adaptive) cannot be managed in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Challenges in [[innovation_portfolio_management_and_its_challenges | Innovation Portfolio Management]]

A key challenge is whether different types of [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] can effectively coexist within the same portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Simply juggling various projects (anticipatory, adaptive, enhancement-oriented) does not guarantee synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Often, there are so many activities that it's difficult to gain an overview of how they fit together or how their impacts intermingle and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

Initial analysis of portfolio management (in both public and private sectors) reveals various components, including sense-making, stewardship, supportive structures, defining purposes, finding synergies, resourcing, monitoring, evaluation, learning, and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, most portfolio approaches tend to focus only on initial sense-making and stewardship, with little attention given to the institutional or organizational supporting structures, valuation, and monitoring needed for ongoing function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

A common challenge is the siloed nature of large organizations, which impedes effective collaboration necessary for a portfolio approach <a class="yt>01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. There's also the issue of dealing with actors or institutions that hold power and vested interests in maintaining current systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>.

## Components and Approaches to [[innovation_portfolio_management_in_the_public_sector | Innovation Portfolio Management]]

### OECD's Portfolio Assessment Tool

OPSI is developing an [[innovation_portfolio_management_in_the_public_sector | innovation portfolio assessment tool]] specifically for public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This tool is designed for organizational level, as this is often where [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] processes and portfolios begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

Target users include:
*   **Lone wolf innovators:** Individuals seeking to understand their organization's [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] portfolio and drive systemic discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Forward-looking teams and innovation labs:** Groups interested in making a case for [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]], legitimizing processes, managing their own portfolios, and understanding how organizational structures influence their ability to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Central organizations and senior advisors:** Traditional stewards of policy portfolios who want a systemic view of [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] portfolios to build strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

The tool will feature different modules:
1.  **Experience-based module:** Generates heat maps showing how organizational experiences (tools, methods, culture, rules, procurement, leadership, incentives) shape and potentially bias [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] portfolios, particularly across different types of [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] (mission, enhancement, anticipatory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
2.  **Project-based assessment module:** Evaluates how different [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] projects align with various innovation types and their value within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. It aims to assess common outcomes and synergies of layered projects, and whether resources and effort are sufficient to achieve organizational goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. This provides a snapshot of resource allocation and value in the broader portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
3.  **In-depth organizational analysis module:** A close look at how individuals perceive and interact with the [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] portfolio, and how these perceptions change based on roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. This aims for a full picture of all elements acting together within an organization and its innovation goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

### Vinnova (Swedish Government Innovation Agency)

Vinnova, the Swedish government [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] agency, applies portfolio thinking at the agency level, missions, and on-the-ground places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Their focus is on achieving societal outcomes rather than just setting targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. They prioritize action, collapsing policy and delivery to change how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

Key aspects of their approach:
*   **Mission Portfolio:** Separates societal outcomes (missions like affordable sustainable neighborhoods) from enablers (like AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. Missions align top-down and bottom-up activities across disciplines, sectors, and levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.
*   **Learning System:** Recognizes there's no fixed playbook for missions, so they create a learning system through highly participative co-design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. They work with hundreds of organizations to develop "system canvases" for missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.
*   **Demand and Supply Side:** Stretches out approaches to include both technology-push (supply side) and demand-side measures (citizen engagement, place understanding, cultural adaptation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
*   **System Layers:** Considers places (e.g., streets, schools) as systems demonstrators, with common systemic layers running across them to enable scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Beyond Investment:** Views portfolios as platforms and systems for deeper engagement, not just investment checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.
*   **Place-Based Delivery:** Focuses on "objects" like streets or schools as complex systems to be "busted open" from siloed management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. This allows for a portfolio of actors (e.g., car companies, landscape designers, school kids) to drive multiple outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.
*   **Value Models:** Uses metrics beyond traditional traffic measures (e.g., decreasing domestic violence by adding greenery to streets) to guide a portfolio of interventions at the street level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
*   **Aligning Existing Projects:** Missions serve as an umbrella to align existing projects, investments, and various types of [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] (anticipatory, enhancement-oriented) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Agency Role:** The agency acts as a "glue," facilitating missions and working across national, local, and regional levels, and public/private sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

### Climate-KIC

Climate-KIC, a pan-European EU-funded [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] agency, has pivoted its strategy to a portfolio approach since late 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. Their core belief is that incremental [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] is insufficient for addressing the climate emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. They moved from grant funding single-point innovation to being deliberately transformative, demand-driven, and applying [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] in systems through an intervention perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.

Their portfolio approach has two interlinked sides:
1.  **Composition:** Making deliberate choices about work from a portfolio perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. This means moving away from project-by-project decisions to those based on the sum of the whole, interactions, complementarity, and where individual activities fit within a broader portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>.
2.  **Sense-making:** Understanding what is being learned from external activities that catalyze system change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. This informs what to do next in an agile way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

Climate-KIC uses a portfolio approach to navigate high levels of uncertainty, providing a spread of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>. They consider diversity of [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] (beyond technology to business models, citizen engagement, policy, finance) and apply the approach across various scales (whole organization, projects, programs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.

Key practices and learnings:
*   **Collective Intelligence:** Utilizes diverse colleagues from different parts of the organization for consensus-based decision-making in composition and sense-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. This addresses inherent biases and incorporates broader perspectives, crucial for complex challenges like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.
*   **Expertise as One Input:** Decouples expertise from being the sole voice in decision-making, encouraging open-mindedness in complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.
*   **Good Project Isn't Enough:** A project's individual merits may not be sufficient for inclusion if it doesn't align with broader portfolio questions (fit, complementarity, gap-filling, interdependencies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>.
*   **Organizational Change:** Implementing the portfolio approach leads to significant organizational change, shifting behaviors and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>. It pushes people out of their comfort zones, leading to learning and changes in business-as-usual processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.
*   **Demand-Driven Approach:** Focuses on working with "challenge owners" and carefully defining them, understanding that influencers and problem owners may be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.
*   **Space for Outliers:** Allows for serendipity and working with unusual actors to avoid siloing, while still maintaining an orchestrated approach for impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.
*   **Capability Building:** Alongside diverse voices, extensive internal capability building and perspective exploration are crucial to address imbalances in whose voices are heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>.

### Sitra (Finnish Futures Fund)

Sitra focuses on facilitating the development of changemaker [[innovation_skills_for_public_sector | skills]] and attitudes to address "wicked problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. They support other organizations and their internal work in building capacities around [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | innovation portfolios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.

Key aspects of their approach:
*   **Systems Change Focus:** Addresses the global need for systems change rather than just incremental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>. Wicked problems (multiple stakeholders, constant change, multiple scales) require different approaches than traditional management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.
*   **Shift from Strategic to Innovation Portfolio Management:** Distinguishes from traditional strategic portfolio management (executing defined strategies) to [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | innovation portfolio management]] that fosters transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>. This means shifting focus from organization-centric, team-based approaches to collaborating for world transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.
*   **Projects as Experiments:** Projects are no longer flat means of execution but experimental means of learning about and tackling problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.
*   **Transformation Time Span:** Considers the time span needed to achieve transformation when framing a portfolio, using it to inform projects, budgets, and planning cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Integrated Capabilities:** Builds capabilities by integrating three approaches:
    1.  **Sense-making and intelligence practices:** Focus on learning and adapting across projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.
    2.  **Portfolio composition:** Ensures projects have synergies for greater impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.
    3.  **Impact design and visualization:** Designing the portfolio's impact and using visualization techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **Facilitator Role:** Operates across different sectors (government, municipalities, associations, private sector) and time scales in Finnish society, acting as a platform for experimentation and developing new activity models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>.

## Key Learnings & Future Outlook

The field of [[innovation_portfolio_management_in_the_public_sector | innovation portfolio management]] is still new and emerging, more of an art than a science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>.

### Organizational Change vs. Organizing
A portfolio approach often demands or enables significant organizational change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. However, radical change can be met with immediate resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. Instead of planning for a static organizational change, a new framing focuses on "organizing" – creating spaces for constant learning and adapting based on experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>. Projects can be used to sketch out what the organization might become, rather than being defined a priori by the existing structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.

### Leadership Requirements
A new type of leadership is emerging that enables transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. This involves:
*   **Collaboration:** Leaders who collaborate to achieve desired transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>.
*   **Systems Leadership:** The ability of different people within a system to take the lead on various issues, helping the whole system achieve outcomes beyond single organizational goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>.
*   **Letting Go of Control:** A shift from traditional leadership that expects control and knowing all answers, to a willingness to let go of these assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:59">[01:20:59]</a>.
*   **Comfort with Uncertainty:** A personal and behavioral trait to sit in uncomfortable uncertainty, which is crucial when asking people to work in new ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41">[01:21:41]</a>.

### Moving Forward
The OECD plans to launch a beta version of its portfolio assessment tool (Modules 1 and 2) by the end of July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>. This tool will provide a snapshot analysis of an organization's [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | innovation portfolio]] and offer insights into managing mission or system change-oriented portfolios that extend beyond single organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>. A functional tool is aimed for the Government Aftershock event in November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:49">[01:24:49]</a>.

[[innovation_portfolio_management_in_the_public_sector | Innovation portfolio approaches]] are expected to play a huge role in helping public sectors "bounce forward" from crises, not just return to the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:03">[01:26:03]</a>.

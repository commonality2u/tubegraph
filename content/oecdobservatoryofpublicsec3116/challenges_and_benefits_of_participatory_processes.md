Participatory processes, often referred to as co-creation, involve engaging stakeholders to identify problem dimensions and collaboratively design and implement solutions through a generative exchange of insights and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This approach moves beyond simple consultation, which might only involve gathering comments on a draft policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Instead, co-creation fosters a dynamic dialogue where people interact, refine ideas, and align on a path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Benefits of Co-creation

Co-creation processes aim to build [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | inclusive societies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, leading to:
*   More robust solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   Increased support for decisions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Enhanced public acceptance and buy-in for implemented solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.
*   Significant learning experiences for both participants and the administration involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. Public administration officials can learn more in a single day of participatory work than in a year of study with consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
*   Better and more sustainable solutions, particularly for complex challenges, due to the sharing of diverse views, findings, knowledge, and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.
*   Reduced risk of opposition and obstruction during implementation, as stakeholders are engaged early in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.
*   Protection against undue influence from lobbyists by maintaining transparent and open processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>.

## Challenges and Pitfalls

Despite the benefits, implementing co-creation faces several [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_sector_innovation | challenges]]:
*   **Hierarchical Mindset**: A top-down approach is often more comfortable for many in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. This mindset can hinder the openness required for new ideas, views, and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.
*   **Lack of Participatory Knowledge, Skills, and Tools**: Public servants may lack the necessary skills, such as active listening and systemic thinking, to effectively engage in co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.
*   **Time Consumption**: Participatory processes can be time-consuming, especially at the initial stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Change**: Challenges are often addressed in the same way they were 20 years ago, despite the increasing complexity of the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Legitimacy and Transparency**: When moving off traditional policy-making tracks, ensuring ethical processes, transparency, and dealing with the "soft power" unleashed during co-creation are critical to prevent collusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   **Lack of Internal Collaboration**: Public administrations may struggle to host external collaboration if their internal practices are not collaborative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   **Rigid Regulatory Frameworks**: Inflexible national legislation, austerity measures, or cumbersome procurement procedures can impede experimentation and create an unfavorable climate for co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.
*   **Silos within Organizations**: The presence of organizational silos can limit effective collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.
*   **Exclusion of Future Generations**: Current co-creation processes often fail to involve future generations, despite the long-term impact of decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
*   **Distinguishing Public vs. Community Interest**: A group of stakeholders might form a consensus that serves a community interest but not necessarily the broader public interest, requiring public officials to provoke and challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.

## Success Factors and Preconditions

Several factors contribute to the success of participatory processes:
*   **Political Backing and Clear Purpose**: Political support and a clear understanding of the problem to be solved are crucial. The process defines the outcome, not the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.
*   **Skilled Hosting and Secretariat**: A capable secretariat to manage content and a high-powered hosting team to facilitate the process are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
*   **Authenticity and Trust**: Administration must be authentic, listen actively, and respect the process from start to finish. Decisions should reflect the co-created outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **Involving Stakeholders Early**: Engaging stakeholders from the problem definition and solution design phases, through implementation and evaluation, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   **Mindset and Openness**: A willingness to embrace new ideas, views, and opinions is fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.
*   **Understanding Complexity**: Recognizing when a challenge is complex and requires diverse input is key. Simple problems with known solutions may not require extensive participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.
*   **Committed Project Ownership/Sponsorship**: A project sponsor who is committed to the co-creative manner of design, delivery, and implementation, and has the mandate to do so, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. Support from state administration leadership has proven effective in Slovenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.
*   **Concrete Commitments and Communication**: Clearly defined responsibilities, deadlines, and regular communication with all participants about the progress of proposed solutions are essential for continued cooperation and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.
*   **Staff Capacity**: Staff should be skilled in project management, receive regular and systematic training, and have autonomy and willingness to grant discretion to external stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.
*   **Institutional Strategic Buy-in**: Senior leadership must recognize the importance of co-creation for complex, emergent problems, and be willing to engage in a "learning journey" alongside participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.
*   **Ability to "Hold Uncertainty"**: Institutions must learn to embrace and manage uncertainty, which requires a "theory of care" where the administration is open to open-ended questions and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.
*   **Open Working and Transparency**: Processes should be transparent, with open documentation of discussions, learnings, and progress to allow for public challenge and input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.

## Examples and Approaches

### Circular Plastics Alliance (European Commission)
Ian Anderson facilitated a multi-stakeholder alliance to keep waste plastic out of landfills, aiming to recycle 10 million tons of used plastic into new products by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This involved a complex system of producers, designers, consumers, waste collectors, recyclers, public authorities, and regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Instead of legislating, the commission created an alliance by inviting value chain members to co-build a declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Meetings used classic participatory techniques like World Cafe and Open Space Technology, with everything meticulously scripted to ensure freedom within structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>. The process was based on building trust and fostering generative exchange, leading to a declaration with 120 signatories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a>.

### Innovative.si (Slovenian Ministry of Public Administration)
Matia Codra coordinates Innovative.si, a project focused on creatively resolving complex social challenges and building competences for new ways of working in the public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. It strengthens innovation culture in a top-down hierarchical environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. The project matches public sector challenges with facilitators to guide co-creative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Key to its success is the active involvement of users from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   **Innovation Community Platform**: This platform fosters networking, learning, and support, with over 400 members from public, private, and academic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Innovation Ambassadors**: Individuals who actively participate in the community and implement acquired knowledge in their work environments, serving as entry points in their institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

### CoGo Digital Toolkit
Sanja Verbeek was part of an international consortium that developed the CoGo digital toolkit, designed to provide holistic support for public organizations in implementing co-creation at the service level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. It comprises four tools, ideally used consecutively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>:
1.  **CoReady**: Assesses an organization's readiness for co-creation through a self-evaluation questionnaire, providing a roadmap for improvement and allowing for comparison with other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
2.  **CoServe**: Helps determine which public service is most suitable for renewal through co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
3.  **CoNew**: Actively includes service users in the renewal process using user journey mapping to identify problems and suggest improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
4.  **CoMaster**: Assesses the quality of co-creation that occurred during service renewal, helping identify areas for future improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

### Dark Matter Labs (UK)
Indy Johar emphasizes that co-creation is a continuous act, especially for complex systems, rather than a linear process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. Central authority cannot fully understand or control complex systems due to inherent informational problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. Co-creation also involves building a learning capacity within the system, fostering a distributed learning community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. The focus is on re-imagining institutions and [[democracy_and_public_participation_in_policy | democracy itself]] to facilitate collective decision-making in a legitimate way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

One example involved working with a city in Sweden on mental health, a multi-actor problem involving schools, workplaces, homes, and neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. They built a community called Mind Shift because no single agency could drive the necessary change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. This required politicians to "hold space" and engage in a learning journey, rather than providing all the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.

### Participatory Budgeting in Antwerp
This example highlights how to include the voice of citizens who are not typically heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. Antwerp dedicated 10% of its municipal budget to a [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | participatory budgeting]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>. Initially, the usual demographic participated, but the city made a concerted effort to reach immigrant communities, less educated citizens, and impoverished citizens by going to places they frequent like sports centers and supermarkets, ensuring a true reflection of the municipality's inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

## Key Learnings

*   **Mindset Shift**: A fundamental shift from control-oriented mindsets to ones that embrace openness and care is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. This may require different recruitment strategies for public servants who can "hold space" effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.
*   **Systemic Approach**: Co-creation needs to be embedded structurally within institutions, with strategic buy-in from senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
*   **Iterative Policy-making**: Crises like COVID-19 have shown the inadequacy of linear policy-making and the need for agile, iterative processes that continuously adapt based on data and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. This calls for a re-evaluation of public budget planning to allow for such flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.
*   **Citizens as Stakeholders**: There should be no distinction between stakeholders and citizens, as stakeholders *are* citizens. [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_participation | Citizen juries]] and [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | citizen assemblies]] are increasingly used as deliberative frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>.
*   **Learning Communities**: Building and sustaining authentic learning communities through continuous training, networking, and support is vital for ongoing success and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.
*   **Role of the Public Official**: Beyond hosting, public officials also have a role to provoke and challenge community interests to ensure the broader public interest is served, alongside transparent open documentation of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

Co-creation is not a rigid recipe but requires critical assessment and adaptation to each unique context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. It is about fostering a culture of openness, trust, and continuous learning to navigate complex societal challenges effectively.

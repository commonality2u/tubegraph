Government "Aftershock" forums emphasize the critical role of government, particularly in partnership with others, to tackle modern-day challenges and reveal issues about the role and expectations of government now and in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. A key theme emerging from these discussions is the [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | importance of empowering women and local communities]].

## Barefoot College: Fostering Self-Sufficiency

The Barefoot College International, based in India, exemplifies this approach by working with the world's poorest and most remote communities, recognizing their inherent potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. Founded on the Gandhian principle of "Leave No Man Behind," its programs span 93 countries across Latin America, Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and 14 Pacific Island states, addressing 14 of the 17 United Nation Sustainable Development Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.

### Empowering Women as Agents of Change
A flagship program of Barefoot College is its innovative, multifaceted, women-led clean energy initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. This program trains mainly illiterate and semi-literate women to become solar engineers, known as "solar mamas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

Beyond technical skills, Barefoot College developed a co-curriculum called "Enrich" that focuses on "soft skills" to enhance aspirations, confidence, and competencies in areas such as:
*   Financial inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>
*   Digital inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>
*   Women's health (especially reproductive health) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>
*   Microenterprise skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>
*   Civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>
*   Human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>
*   Environmental sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>

This comprehensive approach recognizes that access to energy alone is insufficient; providing tools and knowledge to leverage that access into other competencies creates more long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.

Trained women return to their communities to build, install, and maintain solar systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. Households receiving solar power contribute a portion of their previous kerosene, candle, and battery expenses to a village fund, which pays the solar engineers' salaries and covers replacement parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

The benefits of this empowerment include:
*   Light from dusk to dawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>
*   Ability to pump water, saving women time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>
*   Better education outcomes for children and adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>
*   Improved health outcomes by reducing exposure to kerosene smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>
*   Empowerment of women and girls, particularly important in regions where girls are married off at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>
*   Environmental sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>
*   Livelihood development, by enabling two incomes per household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>

This "Power Platform" allows for social and economic growth by putting education and technology directly into the hands of communities, who inherently understand their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. It promotes self-sufficiency and agency, which are vital for creating developmental opportunities in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

Women are seen as catalysts because they are often an untapped resource, marginalized, uneducated, and restricted to household roles, limiting their aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. Achieving gender parity could increase world GDP by 26%, exceeding the combined GDP of the USA and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

### Government Partnerships
Barefoot College works with governments, private organizations, and NGOs, seeking proactive investment to scale their model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Zanzibar**: The President highlighted the importance of solar mamas in their energy policy to reach last-mile communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.
*   **Madagascar**: The government partnered to build a Regional Training Center, planning to train 744 solar engineers and electrify 630,000 homes by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.
*   **Fiji**: The government is building a Regional Training Center, with the Minister for Women recognizing its key role in [[empowering_public_servants_with_tools_and_insights | empowering women]] in rural communities to drive prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

### Adapting to Crisis
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Barefoot College quickly pivoted its microenterprise training to help communities meet new needs, such as producing PPE equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. They also focused on ensuring communities did not go hungry, addressing sudden shortfalls in income and resources caused by the larger economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

## Other Approaches to Public and Community Engagement

### Ministry of Possibilities (UAE)
The UAE's Ministry of Possibilities is a virtual ministry created to incubate and solve systemic challenges and "impossibilities" that hinder government progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. It operates with time-bound departments focused on "wicked questions" or national portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This model applies design thinking and experimentation to develop proactive and disruptive solutions, critically bringing together federal and local government teams, the [[privatepublic_partnerships_in_addressing_global_challenges | private sector]], and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The ministry's work centers on identifying "Impossibles," incubating solutions, educating individuals on design and experimentation, and inspiring other governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>.

This approach acknowledges the challenge of initiating projects with unknown solutions in a government environment that typically seeks certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. It requires protecting those who try, giving them a "safe zone" with legal permission to experiment outside current regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:54">[01:48:54]</a>. Leadership buy-in is crucial, as is making all stakeholders (citizens, private sector, government entities) owners of the problem, fostering synergy and shared commitment to impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>.

### Elements of AI (Finland)
The "Elements of AI" initiative, an online course from the University of Helsinki, aims to improve AI literacy among the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. This directly supports [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_participation | citizen participation]] by enabling the public to engage in discourse about regulating AI and digital technologies, which are societal and political questions, not merely technological ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.

The course emphasizes AI for everyone, requiring no coding or complex math, and focuses on understanding how AI affects society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>. It boasts a high diversity of participants, including 38% female users globally and a majority in Nordic countries, as well as users from various ages and backgrounds, breaking typical online course demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. The goal is to transform people from consumers of AI into contributors, better able to work with and manage AI projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

### Hack the Crisis (Estonia)
Estonia's "Hack the Crisis" initiative, a rapid online hackathon organized in response to COVID-19, showcased strong public-private cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. The initiative demonstrated that government can act as a facilitator for important projects, leveraging existing strong connections with the private sector and tech community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. It yielded solutions like a government chatbot for citizen questions and physical assets like breathing ventilators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

## Lessons for Future Engagement
The experiences highlight several key lessons:
*   **Partnership is key**: Continued and strong collaboration between public, private, and non-governmental sectors is essential to drive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Leverage urgency**: Crises can act as catalysts for rapid innovation; this momentum should be leveraged for other critical societal challenges like mental health and climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>.
*   **Address systemic issues**: Innovation labs and programs should aim to identify and address systemic errors that hinder effective public services, requiring a bold approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:47">[01:51:47]</a>.
*   **Ensure equitable benefits**: While digital innovations offer great potential, it's crucial to ensure they are equally beneficial to all citizens and do not exacerbate knowledge or skills gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
*   **Balance innovation with care**: The rapid pace of innovation can lead to burnout; it's important to provide support and time for reflection for those driving change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.
*   **Empowerment through education and tools**: Providing communities with the tools and knowledge empowers them to find their own solutions and overcome challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. This is critical for [[empowering_public_servants_with_tools_and_insights | empowering public servants with tools and insights]] and citizens alike.

The past year has demonstrated that years or even decades of advancement can occur in a short time, proving that impactful innovation, especially through [[cocreation_and_stakeholder_engagement_in_mission_setting | co-creation and stakeholder engagement]], is possible within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.

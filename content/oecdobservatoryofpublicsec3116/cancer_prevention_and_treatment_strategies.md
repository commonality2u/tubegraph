This article summarizes key insights from a workshop focused on mission-oriented innovation to optimize [[personalized_medicine | personalized medicine]] for [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer prevention]], diagnosis, and [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | treatment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The event was jointly hosted by Vision Zero Cancer and the OECD Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation_strategies | Public Sector Innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Challenge of Cancer
In 2020 alone, 2.7 million people in Europe were diagnosed with [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]], and 1.3 million lost their lives to the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Globally, the problem is even more extensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. With an aging population, a rising number of [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] cases is expected in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:18">[01:38:18]</a>. This makes collaborative efforts to combat [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] a worthwhile and urgent purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Mission-Oriented Innovation Approach
The concept of mission-oriented innovation involves purpose-driven, ambitious tasks and outcomes that require collective innovation to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. It's a coordinated package of initiatives—policy, regulatory, and collective action—tailored to mobilize science, technology, and innovation to address societal challenges in a precise way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. Key requirements include:
*   Ambitious and concrete goals within a defined timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   Spanning multiple stages of the innovation cycle, from research to market launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   Crossing various disciplines, sectors, and policy silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>.
*   Utilizing different support instruments, both supply-side and demand-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

This approach is seen as a way to move complex adaptive systems, like healthcare, to a more desirable state without requiring destructive overhauls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.

## European and National Strategies for Cancer Control

### European Union
The European Union has launched a European Cancer Mission, with an update occurring prior to the workshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>. This mission involves setting up national mission hubs in every country to coordinate local, regional, national, and European actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:08">[01:31:08]</a>. The European Commission presented Europe's Beating Cancer Plan in February 2021, aiming to tackle the entire disease pathway, structured around four key actions: prevention, early detection, diagnosis and [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | treatment]], and improvement of quality of life for [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:07">[01:36:07]</a>. The European Cancer Mission and Europe's Beating Cancer Plan aim to make a real difference in people's lives by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Sweden: Vision Zero Cancer
Sweden is a leading example, adopting an ecosystem-purpose-driven approach to [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Vision Zero Cancer is a vision-driven innovation milieu where actors across society engage in strategic collaborations to defeat [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:41">[02:24:41]</a>. Its ambition is global, starting in Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:48">[02:24:48]</a>.

**Goals and Structure:**
*   To build a resilient society through collaboration and innovation, placing the citizen and [[role_of_patient_involvement_in_cancer_research | patient]] at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:57">[02:24:57]</a>.
*   Managed as a partnership, coordinated by the research institute at Stockholm School of Economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:37">[02:26:37]</a>.
*   Founded by a "quintuple helix" collaboration, including large industrial companies (e.g., Elekta, AstraZeneca), Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, regional [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] centers, [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | Cancer]] Society, research groups, think tanks, [[role_of_patient_involvement_in_cancer_research | patient]] associations, academia, and industry associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>.
*   Aims to create a "one-stop shop" for innovation in [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] care in Sweden, moving from isolated initiatives to a national point of contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:57">[02:49:57]</a>.
*   The vision is "Vision Zero [[Cancer_Treatment_and_Prevention | Cancer]]" – no one should die of [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]], and more people should live longer and better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:16">[03:00:16]</a>.
*   Focuses on five areas with milestones for system renewal: prevention, early detection and diagnosis, [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | treatment]], quality of life, supported by science, clinical trials, health data and registries, and economic/ethical considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:06">[02:59:06]</a>.
*   Started with lung [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] due to its challenges and opportunities, moving towards an agnostic approach, and focusing on pediatric [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] and [[personalized_medicine | personalized medicine]] generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:33">[02:51:33]</a>.

**Swedish [[Cancer_Treatment_and_Prevention | Cancer]] Strategy (since 2009):**
*   Established six regional [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] centers for knowledge management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:57">[01:56:57]</a>.
*   Led to more [[role_of_patient_involvement_in_cancer_research | patient]]-focused, accessible, equitable, and effective [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:06">[01:57:06]</a>.
*   Key activities include 50 national guidelines, over 30 standardized care pathways, approximately 30 registries, and 11 concentrations of highly specialist treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:24">[01:57:24]</a>.
*   Contact nurses and more equal use of therapies are now in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:40">[01:57:40]</a>.
*   Sweden has high survival rates: 85% for children with [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] and 70% for adult [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] [[role_of_patient_involvement_in_cancer_research | patients]] are long-term survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>.
*   To achieve "vision zero [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]]," survival needs to improve by 15% in children and 30% in adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>.
*   This is targeted through [[personalized_medicine | precision diagnostics]] and [[personalized_medicine | precision treatment]], combined with more focus on prevention, early detection, and rehabilitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>.
*   Swedish successes are attributed to free [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] care (public responsibility, tax-financed), close collaboration between healthcare, academia, and industry, and an active [[implementation_of_health_policies | public health policy]] for lifestyle-related diseases, screening, and vaccination programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:38">[01:58:38]</a>.

### Germany: National Decade Against Cancer

## Key Themes in Cancer Control Strategies

### [[Personalized_Medicine | Personalized Medicine]]
A paradigm shift in healthcare towards [[personalized_medicine | personalized medicine]] allows for tailored and more impactful approaches, aiming for equal access to diagnosis and [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | treatment]] across Europe and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This includes developing [[personalized_medicine | precision diagnostics]] and [[personalized_medicine | precision treatment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

### Prevention and Early Detection
Focus on prevention is a key strategy, aiming to reduce preventable [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:24">[01:39:24]</a>. This includes [[implementation_of_health_policies | public health policy]] to prevent lifestyle-related diseases, screening programs, and HPV vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:11">[01:59:11]</a>. Examples include working with early symptoms and risk assessment in primary care and pushing for national lung [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] screening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:02">[02:27:02]</a>.

### [[Role of Patient Involvement in Cancer Research | Patient Involvement]]
Integrating the [[role_of_patient_involvement_in_cancer_research | patient]] into the system, from diagnosis to treatment and outcome, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. There is a strong focus on improving [[role_of_patient_involvement_in_cancer_research | patient participation]] in research and a desire to shift the culture of [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] research towards [[role_of_patient_involvement_in_cancer_research | patient]]-oriented research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:41">[01:49:41]</a>. This involves including [[role_of_patient_involvement_in_cancer_research | patient]] representatives in strategy committees, working groups, and evaluation panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:20">[01:52:20]</a>.

### Collaboration and Ecosystem Activation
Effective [[innovation strategies | innovation]] requires working together across sectors and disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This means activating an ecosystem and creating synergies across different innovations and actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Collaborations can be between healthcare, academia, and industry, as seen in Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:55">[01:58:55]</a>. Organizations emphasize creating a "community of values and cultures based on cooperation and learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:14">[03:33:14]</a>.

### Data and Registries
National quality registers and clinical guidelines are important contributing factors to successful [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:35">[01:59:35]</a>. Health data and registries are also key areas for system renewal in [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:27">[02:26:27]</a>.

### Regulatory and Ethical Aspects
The highly regulated nature of healthcare means that policies and laws at local, regional, national, and global levels influence the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Addressing regulatory, ethical, and funding barriers is crucial for missions to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. National drug authorities are directly involved in strategy committees and working groups in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:02">[01:51:02]</a>.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned in Implementation

### Complexity and Uncertainty
Healthcare is an "adaptive complex system" where changes ripple unpredictably, often causing unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Mission-oriented initiatives must operate in conditions of uncertainty, making project planning difficult when outcomes are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>.

### Silos and Coordination
One of the main challenges is crossing disciplinary, sectoral, and policy silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>. This requires complex multi-level, cross-ministerial, and cross-agency governance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. Ensuring timing coherence between different policies and initiatives that may hold back the mission is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>.

### Long-Term Commitment and Sustaining Momentum
Missions are long-lasting initiatives, and it's difficult to maintain engagement from all stakeholders and public attention for 10 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:58">[01:47:58]</a>.

### Conflicts of Interest
Managing conflicts of interest among experts and stakeholders who may also wish to conduct the research or have specific interests is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>. Diversity of membership on expert panels, including international members, can help mitigate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:59">[01:29:59]</a>.

### Defining Metrics and Evaluation
Measuring the impact of systemic interventions is complex, and there is a lack of adapted methodologies and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. Setting clear, articulable metrics and conducting early evaluations to refine the mission's path are crucial for accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:04">[01:28:04]</a>.

### Language and Communication
Communicating complex mission concepts in an inclusive way that resonates with diverse stakeholders, including citizens, is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:20">[02:25:20]</a>. Avoiding jargon and encouraging rather than discouraging engagement is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:35">[02:25:35]</a>. Bridging the "language" and "tempo" differences between national policymakers and local implementers is a persistent challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:11">[02:14:11]</a>.

### Scaling Up and Leadership
Scaling up successful mission-oriented initiatives from subsystems to a broader scale is a common hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Strong, active leadership that can manage different interests, appreciate diverse knowledge, and foster trust is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:31">[03:32:31]</a>. Political backing and senior leadership support are vital for navigating uncertainty and resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:44">[02:24:44]</a>.

The overarching lesson is that while the mission framework generates attention and political will, the "doing part"—implementation, trust-building, and continuous adaptation—is where the real work lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>.

Foresight plays a crucial role in enabling public sector organizations to detect, understand, and act upon future changes in their present-day work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. This is particularly vital when confronting long-term, complex challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Why Foresight Matters for Climate and Biodiversity

The future is deeply relevant to how societies address the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. [[strategic_foresight_for_future_global_challenges | Strategic foresight]] contributes significantly to promoting public trust and preparing governments to better serve societies amidst these environmental shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.

Terms like "future-proof" or "future-fit" only hold meaning if organizations actively work in the present to prepare for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. While this involves enhanced knowledge and analysis, it is also a deeper matter of policy legitimacy in a democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## Integrating Foresight into Policy Actions

While governments constantly consider the future, they often do not fully leverage what they could or should know to better prepare for and shape it—a phenomenon termed the "impact gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. There is no shortage of high-quality [[foresight_and_scenario_planning | strategic foresight]] and anticipation work, much of it generated by governments and organizations like the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

The challenge lies in ensuring that [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] and other anticipatory work translate into tangible policy actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. This means:
*   **Prototyping and Experimentation** Developing new approaches like prototyping to embed [[foresight_and_scenario_planning | strategic foresight]] work into national government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. This involves creating innovative and value-changing prototypes and experiments to bridge the impact gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing Uncertainty** Considering multiple alternative futures helps in imagining potential outcomes and making more prepared decisions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Foresight is about integrating uncertainty into decision-making rather than being paralyzed by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>.
*   **Learning and Evidence Gathering** The learning and evidence obtained through experimentation are central to public sector innovation and effective democratic and sustainable public policy, forming what is known as [[anticipatory_innovation_and_strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | anticipatory innovation governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Approaches

### Organizational Habits and Risk Aversion
A significant challenge in applying foresight, particularly within large bureaucratic institutions like governments, is overcoming entrenched organizational habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. These habits can include:
*   Adherence to existing policies and precedents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>.
*   Resistance to change due to past routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.
*   Risk-averse cultures and insufficient internal capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.
*   A "myth of best practice," where past methods are assumed to work in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>.

Unless these habits are investigated, thinking about the future and innovation remains challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.

### The "What if We Were Wrong?" Question
Foresight prompts the critical question: "What if we were wrong?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. This is difficult for large organizations to entertain, but events like the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated the dramatic impact of unexpected disruptions and the potential for being significantly wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>. The focus has now shifted to preparedness rather than merely convincing people they might be wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.

### Time Horizons and Policy Options
Considering a longer time horizon, such as a decade or a generation, fundamentally changes the available policy options for solving complex problems like reforming an education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>. This longer runway is a key goal of futures work and its connection to the innovation process, especially where experimentation plays a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.

### Overcoming Foresight Illiteracy
Many organizations face a lack of "foresight literacy," where policy and political pressures often focus on the short-term present rather than anticipating future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>. This is compounded by a culture that prioritizes quantitative models, which can struggle to incorporate factors like human values or behavioral changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.

To address this, training programs help colleagues become more comfortable with uncertainty, emphasizing that it does not inherently mean negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:00">[22:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>. Foresight's purpose is to help steer towards positive outcomes and mitigate negative ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>.

### Continuous Experimentation
Due to the diverse contexts and specific policy requests, foresight practitioners must continually experiment, adapting standard methods and processes to unique circumstances and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:00">[23:48:00]</a>. Every project typically requires some form of experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>. For example, organizing participatory foresight sessions with high-level decision-makers, such as using a scenario exploration system with the European Commission's college, can "contaminate their thinking with foresight seeds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:00">[24:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:56:00">[24:56:00]</a>.

Collaborative learning through designed experiments—involving public sector, academia, and private sector—allows for testing, observing, reflecting, and re-testing to gain insights in uncertain environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>.

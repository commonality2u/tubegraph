In the realm of public sector innovation, the journey from problem identification to successful implementation is complex. While the initial phase of [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | generating good ideas]] is crucial, the subsequent process of evaluating and selecting which ideas to pursue is equally, if not more, critical for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:45:00">[45:45:00]</a>.

## What is Ideation (and why selection is key)
[[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | Ideation]] is more than just brainstorming; it involves finding the best ideas from various internal and external sources, then effectively screening and prioritizing them to determine which ones to move forward with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. It's about exploring many different options and solutions to a specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. Once numerous potential ideas are generated, the challenge shifts to narrowing them down to a manageable handful for further exploration or implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Selecting Ideas
A significant challenge in the public sector is the tendency to celebrate only grand successes, often overlooking the failures, false starts, and false steps that occur behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This creates a perception that innovation only happens when it works out perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

When it comes to selecting ideas, transparency is often lacking. The process of how ideas from public consultations or different ministries are filtered down to a few policy proposals can seem like a "secret sauce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:37:00">[46:37:00]</a>. This lack of transparency can lead to selections based on the popularity of the person proposing the idea, their assertiveness, or the strength of their internal coalition, rather than the intrinsic merit of the idea itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:10:00">[47:10:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Idea Selection

### Beyond Simplified Scoring Models
A common, yet often oversimplified, method for filtering ideas involves using scoring models with components like novelty, usefulness, value, acceptance, feasibility, visibility, and risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:41:00">[47:41:00]</a>. While these can provide a basic framework, they don't always capture the nuances of different innovation contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:53:00">[49:53:00]</a>.

### Considering the Purpose of Innovation
The criteria for selecting ideas should align with the purpose of the innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:16:00">[48:16:00]</a>.

*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation**: If the goal is to solve a clearly defined problem (e.g., poverty), the primary selection criterion should be the idea's consistency with the mission and its ability to systematically move towards the desired solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>. Novelty might be less important here; if an existing idea works, it should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:00">[49:09:00]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory/Radical Innovation**: When exploring new technologies or uncertain areas (e.g., artificial intelligence, blockchain), traditional legitimacy or risk propositions might be less relevant because existing feedback systems may dismiss such ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:17:00">[49:17:00]</a>. In these cases, the willingness to experiment and explore multiple options is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:02:00">[52:02:00]</a>.

There isn't one "best" method for narrowing down ideas; the strategy must be cognizant of the specific goals and the potential outcomes of each approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:26:00">[51:26:00]</a>. An iterative approach, allowing for experimentation, can lead to a list of options to explore further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:04:00">[52:04:00]</a>.

### Avoiding Biases in Selection
Formats like "Shark Tank" or "Dragon's Den" where individuals pitch ideas can be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:05:00">[50:05:00]</a>. These confrontational situations often highlight the presenter's personal characteristics and sales ability rather than the merits of the idea itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>. Many talented public sector innovators may avoid such panels, leading to a biased selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:35:00">[50:35:00]</a>. To ensure an inclusive filtering strategy, it's essential to explore diverse methods that reduce the impact of personal biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:55:00">[50:55:00]</a>.

## Checklist for Ideation and Selection Readiness
Before moving into ideation, and subsequently selection, consider the following practical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:46:00">[33:46:00]</a>:

1.  **Problem Framing**: Have you spent enough time truly understanding and loving the problem, rather than jumping straight to solutions? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a> This prevents common pitfalls like developing a solution and then trying to find a problem for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Innovation Environment**: Do you understand the innovation environment, including whether it's a top-down or bottom-up initiative, and how resistant leadership might be to change in the specific topic area? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:12:00">[35:12:00]</a> This includes political, organizational, and external factors, especially for problems where the public sector has limited control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:33:00">[35:33:00]</a>.
3.  **Strategy Match**: Does your [[ideation_and_generating_good_ideas | ideation and generating good ideas]] strategy match your environment? For uncertain, emergent spaces, broad strategies like crowdsourcing or public consultations might be needed. For more understood problems with less uncertainty, a smaller, selected group may suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:23:00">[36:23:23]</a>.
4.  **Inclusivity**: Does your strategy allow everyone to contribute effectively? People work differently; an environment focused solely on extroverted, "on-your-toes" interactions (like rapid sticky-note sessions) can exclude valuable contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:00">[37:45:00]</a>. Allow time for thoughtful reflection, as ideas can come hours or days after an initial session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>.
5.  **Diverse Engagement**: Do you have the right people engaged? A diverse group with varied backgrounds, thinking styles, genders, education levels, and lived experiences is crucial to avoid groupthink and generate truly novel ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:00">[39:10:00]</a>.

A self-assessment tool, rating the clarity, certainty, agreement, stability, existing solutions, experience, ownership, and discretion related to the problem, can help an organization collectively prepare to respond to challenges and guide the entire innovation process from problem definition through to [[developing_innovation_proposals | proposal development]], execution, and [[evaluating_impact_of_innovation_portfolios | impact evaluation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:04:00">[43:04:00]</a>.

## Next Steps
The process of innovation continues beyond idea selection into [[developing_innovation_proposals | developing innovation proposals]], actual [[implementing_innovative_ideas | implementation]], and diffusion. These steps, and the overall [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | innovation challenges and strategies]] in the public sector, will be explored in subsequent discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

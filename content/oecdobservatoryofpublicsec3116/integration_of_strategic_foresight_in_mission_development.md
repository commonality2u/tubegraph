The "Government Beyond Recovery" conference highlights the shift from recovery to bold missions, emphasizing anticipation in public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis, which began in 2019, presents an opportunity to define new missions to prevent future global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A key challenge is ensuring these missions are long-term, adaptable to alternative futures, and implemented in agile, iterative ways to avoid lock-in within an uncertain future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## The Need for Future-Ready Missions

A poll conducted during the conference revealed that only about 17% of organizations believe their missions are future-ready, while 41% stated they are not, and 43% were unsure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. The highest perceived uncertainty for missions lies in climate challenges (47%) and societal challenges (40%), followed by economic (25%) and health challenges (15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. This underscores the importance of [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | future scenarios]] and integrating [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]] into mission development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Integrating Foresight in Practice

Organizations like the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) are working on both anticipatory and mission-oriented approaches, having recently launched a Missions Action Lab to focus on implementing missions iteratively and in an agile manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### European Commission's Approach
The European Commission's DG Research and Innovation launched five missions in September, backed by potentially billions in funding from the Horizon Europe program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. These missions include:
*   **Conquering Cancer:** Aiming to save 3 million lives by 2030, with people living longer and better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Climate Resilient Europe:** Preparing Europe for climate disruptions and accelerating transition to a healthy, prosperous future by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Mission Starfish (Restoring Oceans and Waters):** Targeting clean marine and freshwaters and restored degraded ecosystems by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **100 Climate Neutral Cities:** Supporting systemic transformation towards climate neutrality by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Caring for Soil (Caring for Life):** Aiming for at least 75% of EU soils to be healthy for food, people, nature, and climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The development of these missions benefited from [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]], an evidence-gathering process, expertise from mission boards, and a novel approach of listening to citizens' inputs through dedicated participative and dialogue techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Danish Perspective: Green Transition Missions
Denmark, post-pandemic, is focusing on [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_policy_making | mission-driven innovation]], particularly in the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The Danish government's green research strategy (September 2020) highlights four green research and innovation missions:
*   Capture and storage/use of CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   Green fuels for transport and industry (e.g., Power2X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   Climate and environment-friendly agriculture and food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   Circular economy with a focus on plastics and textiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

These missions aim for a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050, while also increasing biodiversity and competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. Success relies on systemic development across the full value chain, including technological, financial, and regulatory roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. Denmark has embraced an agile approach, creating the mission program within six months and continuously developing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.

### Norway's Seamless Services through Foresight
Norway's digital strategy prioritizes seamless services for seven "life events" (e.g., new in Norway, losing/finding a job, having children) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. These represent wicked problems requiring systemic change beyond traditional approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. Some life events, like "seriously ill children," are exploring a mission approach, which involves collective, targeted efforts from public, private, and voluntary sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:58">[01:18:58]</a>.

Norway uses [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] methods to future-proof services by analyzing driving forces for change, potential impacts, and developing scenarios to reframe future contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>. This includes exposing strategic blind zones and developing future personas to challenge assumptions and inform the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48">[01:20:48]</a>. The aim is to generate innovative ideas, create long-term value, and foster better collaboration and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

### OECD's Findings on Foresight in Missions
The OECD's analysis of [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_policy_making | mission-oriented innovation policy]] finds that while missions are inherently future-oriented, formal [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | foresight]] practices are not widely used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>. This suggests a "blind spot" where [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight]] could better inform policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:41">[01:42:41]</a>. Missions are often co-created by diverse actors, emphasizing shared objectives and commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:13">[01:43:13]</a>.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Overcoming "Mission Washing"
A significant concern is "mission washing," where existing activities are merely relabeled as "missions" without a true commitment to changing how things are delivered or what innovations are pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. To counter this, missions must be bold, future-oriented, and require doing things differently in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>.

### Political Commitment and Dynamic Processes
Senior leaders face challenges committing to ambitious, long-term missions that may extend beyond their political terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>. To address this, approaches include:
*   **Strong Agreement:** Emphasizing broad, robust agreement across policy areas and citizen buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:27">[01:31:27]</a>.
*   **Decision Points and Monitoring:** Incorporating regular decision points and an analytical framework to monitor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:48">[01:31:48]</a>.
*   **Beyond Framework Programs:** Missions should extend beyond typical multi-year funding cycles (like Horizon Europe's seven-year plan) and involve diverse funding sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:34">[01:33:34]</a>.
*   **Co-creation of Roadmaps:** In Denmark, roadmaps for green missions were co-created by the entire ecosystem (companies, public administration, investors, researchers), allowing diverse partners to see where they fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>.
*   **Learning Mindset and Agile Financing:** Investment plans and governance models should allow for a learning mindset, adapting to unknown future needs for partners and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This means continuous adaptation of mechanisms for financing, evaluating, and driving initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>.
*   **Breaking Incumbent Bias:** [[Role of Strategic Foresight in Anticipatory Innovation | Incorporating partners]] who view mission-driven innovation differently, fostering international collaboration, and integrating social science and humanities are crucial to avoid incumbent bias and ensure broad impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:46">[01:39:46]</a>.

### Integrating Behavioral Dimensions and Well-being
Most climate missions remain technological or scientific, with few venturing into behavioral dimensions, social norms, or population habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:50">[02:10:50]</a>. To make transitions smoother and prevent future pain, it's vital to integrate well-being and behavioral dimensions directly into mission design, encouraging societal efforts beyond just technological fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:01">[02:12:01]</a>. This requires recognizing that missions will inevitably create winners and losers, impacting people's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:01">[02:13:01]</a>.

### Dealing with "Failure"
The concept of "failure" in missions is complex; it's rarely a binary outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>. Instead, it involves aspects that succeed or don't prosper, and often leads to unforeseen positive side effects (e.g., the internet from Cold War missions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:48">[02:17:48]</a>. A system of performance measurement and governance sympathetic to this challenge is needed, fostering a "culture of cooperation" where blame is not attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:45">[02:16:45]</a>. Learning from failures through strong evaluation and reflective processes, potentially with an "exit strategy" that repurposes activities rather than entirely abandoning them, is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:12">[02:20:12]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Future-Proofing Missions

### Intergenerational Justice
To improve intergenerational justice through missions, it's crucial to design processes for deep and effective participation and representation, ensuring the voice of future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:33">[02:35:33]</a>. Japan's public dialogues, for example, create space for people born and not yet born (e.g., 2060 scenarios) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:51">[02:35:51]</a>. Tapping into the energy and perspective of young foresight practitioners who use systematic ways of thinking about the future to transform communities is also vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:09">[02:36:09]</a>. Missions, particularly green deal missions, aim to develop strong connections with youth involvement actions like the European Solidarity Corps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>.

### Rethinking and Adapting Planning Processes
The turbulent 2020s, marked by colliding demographic, ecological, and geopolitical uncertainties, necessitate that policymaking and government planning processes become more emergent and applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:50">[02:06:50]</a>. Planning processes in government, which often look across ministries in the long term, should be opened up and innovated to harness their potential, becoming more participative and future-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:54">[02:07:54]</a>.

[!NOTE]
An emerging area of focus for [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_government_organizations | integrating strategic foresight into government organizations]] is the concept of a "culture of cooperation" and developing performance measurement systems attuned to the challenges of ambitious missions, rather than rigid, binary success/failure metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:54">[02:16:54]</a>.

## Commitments for the Future
The OPSI and OECD's Missions Action Lab are committed to action research and practice-based research, focusing on implementation and providing advice to missions while continuously learning from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:31">[02:27:31]</a>. Personal commitments include:
*   **Courage and Pace:** Being courageous in doing things differently and maintaining a rapid pace, as there is no blueprint for success in solving complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>.
*   **Building Trust and Ownership:** Recognizing the power of sharing information to foster trust and extend ownership in mission implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:39">[02:53:39]</a>.
*   **Intergenerational Fairness:** Continuously asking if decisions and investments are intergenerationally fair and helping to highlight who benefits and who loses between generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:26">[02:56:26]</a>.
*   **Developing Tools and Methods:** Developing and applying tools and methods that integrate [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] across different fields for mission purposes in various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>.

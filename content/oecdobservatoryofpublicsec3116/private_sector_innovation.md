Innovation is generally difficult to define, as it concerns novelty and things that did not exist previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Knowledge about innovation is more extensive in the private sector compared to the [[comparison_of_innovation_between_public_and_private_sectors | public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Definition

In the private sector, innovation involves something new that is implemented within a market context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its primary goal is for a firm to gain a competitive advantage through this innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This can manifest as a new service, process, product, or any other form of new thinking applied to achieve a direct market proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Unlike the [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]], the private sector benefits from the market's feedback system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

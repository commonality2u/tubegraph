Health missions, particularly in the context of personalized medicine for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, represent a collaborative and purpose-driven approach to addressing complex societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Hosted jointly by Vision Zero Cancer and the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), these initiatives aim to solve systemic problems rather than just improve existing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. They necessitate collective innovation and a paradigm shift in healthcare to ensure tailored, impactful, and equitable access to care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Health is recognized as a complex adaptive system, where changes in one area can ripple unpredictably throughout the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. [[mission_oriented_innovation_challenges_and_implementation | Mission-oriented innovation]] offers a framework to navigate this complexity, guiding the system towards a more desirable state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.

## Defining [[mission_oriented_innovation_strategies_and_practices | Mission-Oriented Innovation]] in Health

A mission-oriented approach involves a coordinated package of initiatives, including policy, regulatory actions, and collective efforts like platforms and networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. These are specifically designed to mobilize science, technology, and other resources to precisely address a societal challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>. Key characteristics include:
*   Ambitious and concrete goals with defined timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.
*   Spanning multiple stages of the innovation cycle, from research to market launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   Crossing disciplinary, sectoral, and policy silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.
*   Utilizing diverse support instruments, both supply and demand-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

## Challenges in Implementing Health Missions

Implementing health missions is inherently challenging due to their transformative nature and the complex systems they aim to influence.
*   **Defining Clear and Bold Missions:** It is often difficult to set truly bold, targeted, and measurable missions, with a risk of "mission washing" where objectives remain too broad or confined to science and technology without addressing systemic behavioral change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.
*   **Coordination and Governance:** Establishing and maintaining complex, multi-level, cross-ministerial, and cross-agency governance structures can be cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Engagement:** There can be weaker engagement from non-science, technology, and innovation (STI) stakeholders, including citizens, making it hard to mobilize broader participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.
*   **Measurement and Evaluation:** Measuring the impact of systemic interventions differs significantly from assessing individual, fragmented measures, and appropriate methodologies and tools are often lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
*   **Scaling Up Successes:** Missions often achieve significant results in specific subsystems, but scaling these successes across broader contexts remains a major hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.
*   **Incumbent Biases and Resistance:** Missions can be disruptive to established roles, technical capabilities, and partnerships, requiring deliberate efforts to address existing structures and overcome biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.
*   **"Quick Win" Mentality:** Avoiding a "quick win" mentality, where focus is on single-point projects rather than a broader target, is crucial for long-term mission success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.
*   **Budget and Scope:** Balancing ambitious goals with finite budgets and defining key priority areas within a long-term timeframe (e.g., 10 years) can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>.
*   **Political Changes:** Political shifts and the need to align national procedures with local initiatives can create significant resistance and tempo differences between various levels of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:54">[02:13:54]</a>.
*   **Managing Conflicts of Interest:** Particularly in smaller communities of experts, managing conflicts of interest among those who inform research priorities and also seek to conduct that research is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>.

## Strategies for Effective Implementation

### 1. Co-creation and Broad Engagement
*   **Purpose-Driven Approach:** Missions need to be purpose-driven, ambitious, and lead to specific outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Involving Diverse Stakeholders:** Bringing together key players from medicine, research, society (including patients), politics, regulatory authorities, and the business sector is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.
*   **Patient Participation:** Actively involving patients in research and decision-making processes, even to the point of shared decision-making, requires a cultural shift for clinicians and informed patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:41">[01:49:41]</a>.
    *   *Example (Germany):* The National Decade Against Cancer involves patient representatives in strategy committees, working groups, and even in the evaluation of proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:20">[01:52:20]</a>.
*   **Community-Driven Initiatives:** Missions can be vehicles to grow a movement, driven by the community itself, not just top-down directives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:54">[02:19:54]</a>.
    *   *Example (Camden Council):* The Food Mission aims to be community-driven, moving from a council decision to a continuous effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:01">[02:20:01]</a>.

### 2. Building Trust and Shared Ownership
*   **Trust and Connection:** Building trust between different levels (national, regional, local) and various organizations is essential for successful co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>.
*   **Sharing Responsibilities:** Encouraging common ownership and commitment from all stakeholders, even those who may not see immediate direct benefits, is vital for long-term engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:40">[01:48:40]</a>.
*   **New Narratives:** Developing new narratives and language that resonate with all stakeholders (quadruple helix: researchers, entrepreneurs, governments, citizens) helps foster belief and shared purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:21">[01:58:21]</a>.
    *   *Example (Netherlands):* The "Don t Louise" village for dementia patients shared its dream with the entire community, inviting contributions from bakers, municipalities, tech entrepreneurs, and neighbors, leading to an open village where residents can freely move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:33">[02:03:33]</a>.

### 3. Adaptive Planning and Governance
*   **Adaptive Approach:** Missions must remain adaptive over their lifespan, adjusting to new information and emerging priorities. This can be supported by regular evaluations and feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>.
*   **Early Evaluation:** Implementing early evaluation processes to check if grants and initial activities are meeting objectives allows for refinement of the mission's path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>.
*   **Clear Terms of Reference:** For expert advisory panels or similar bodies, clear terms of reference or scope help manage expectations and prioritize within finite budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:35">[01:29:35]</a>.
*   **Diverse Membership:** Ensuring diversity within expert panels, including international members, can help mitigate conflicts of interest and bring independent perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>.
*   **Multi-Level Linkages:** Consciously connecting local, regional, national, and international actions is critical for successful implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:29">[01:30:29]</a>.

### 4. Strategic Communication and Storytelling
*   **Translating High-Level Goals:** Clearly translating overarching mission goals into short, medium, and long-term investments helps ensure alignment and coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:53">[01:26:53]</a>.
*   **Mindful Language:** Using inclusive and encouraging language is crucial, as many stakeholders may not be familiar or interested in the technical framework of missions. The communication should make it clear that it's not just "another strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:20">[02:25:20]</a>.
*   **Public Dialogue:** Engaging in comprehensive public dialogue can gather feedback and build broader public awareness and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:29">[01:46:29]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Opportunities:** Actively identifying and leveraging opportunities with national and international partners can increase the impact of missions beyond direct funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>.

### 5. Embracing Uncertainty and Learning
*   **Working with Uncertainty:** Missions often operate in conditions of amplitude and uncertainty, as outcomes cannot always be precisely defined upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>.
*   **Learning Journeys:** Acknowledge that implementing missions is a continuous learning journey, requiring openness to criticism and a willingness to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a>.
*   **Enabling Infrastructure:** Provide an enabling infrastructure that empowers diverse actors and creates connections for effective communication and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a>. This includes creating opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and multi-level learning between different organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:50">[02:12:50]</a>.

By addressing these challenges with proactive strategies, health missions can drive significant societal change and improve health outcomes.

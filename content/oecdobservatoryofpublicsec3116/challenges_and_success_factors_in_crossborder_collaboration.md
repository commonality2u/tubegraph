Governments are increasingly looking beyond their borders to develop solutions to global challenges, as complex issues have become the norm in a continuously changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. While there are many examples of this happening, such as ending pandemics, tackling migration, or reducing economic carbon dependency, it is not yet clear how cross-border collaboration can be best achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. The central question is how governments can improve their ability to innovate together for the public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated digital transformation and the pace of innovation, while also exposing shortcomings and pre-existing vulnerabilities at the national level, highlighting a lack of preparedness among governments to tackle global challenges like climate change, pandemics, or disruptions in global value chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. Public sector innovation has become a key tool to collectively address today's most pressing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. However, government innovation efforts are largely confined to national and local borders, raising the question of why global level collaboration is not happening more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed Bin Rashid Centre for Government Innovation have partnered to determine how innovative practices can best support [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border government collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Their research, global calls for innovation, and workshops aim to understand and facilitate this collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## Key Challenges to Cross-border Government Innovation
Research highlights several significant barriers to [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border government innovation]]:
*   **Cultural Norms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>: These are often cited as a primary challenge, creating friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a> and blocking emergent projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Feedback Mechanisms and Learning Loops** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>: Without structured processes to capture and apply lessons learned, efforts remain isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:33:00">[27:33:00]</a>.
*   **Undeveloped Ecosystems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>: The absence of a robust supporting environment, including shared infrastructure and established communities, hinders collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a>. This is often the most significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:00">[31:54:00]</a>.
*   **Scaling of Experiments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>: Moving from successful pilots to widespread implementation across borders proves difficult without pre-considered design for scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">[27:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:53:00">[28:53:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding Cost and Benefits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>: Clearly articulating the value proposition for all partners is crucial but often complex.
*   **Procedural and Legal Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>: Innovation can feel "handmade in combat each time," as project managers must negotiate with various departments (attorneys, public affairs, CIOs) often without sufficient support structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:30">[37:51:30]</a>. Legal and policy restrictions, such as those governing financial awards, can also necessitate parallel processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.
*   **Lack of Institutionalization**: Unlike scientific fields where global collaboration, shared data, and experimental results are commonplace, the public sector often lacks established disciplines, journals, funders, or formal mechanisms to organize and share knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>. Most governments also lack stable roles, structures, and funding streams for innovation, let alone for [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:23:00">[35:23:00]</a>.

## Success Factors for Cross-border Collaboration
Overcoming these challenges relies on several key success factors:

*   **Culture of Openness and Innovation**: This is a critical characteristic for successful projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>. Creating a movement where joining innovative initiatives is seen as "cool" and beneficial fosters participation and momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:24">[01:20:24]</a>.
*   **Agility and Adaptability**: Being able to adjust and respond flexibly to evolving needs is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>. The UAE's government accelerators, for example, emphasize a flexible, fast, and agile government cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding and Engaging Diverse Stakeholders and Ecosystems**: This involves mapping the ecosystem to identify interested parties and then actively engaging them. It's not just about making data open, but about building active ecosystems around that data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. This includes building communities of practice and supporting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:21:00">[40:21:00]</a>.
*   **Clearly Defining Roles and Responsibilities**: Ambiguity about who is responsible for what can impede progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>.
*   **Honing the Role of Cross-border Facilitators or Orchestrators**: Individuals or entities dedicated to building relationships and bringing people together are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:00">[28:16:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Budgeting**: When piloting initiatives, budgets should assume success to ensure ongoing resources for scaling, preventing delays in implementation due to funding gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a>.
*   **Iteration and Learning**: Building in structured learning groups and feedback mechanisms allows for continuous improvement and learning from both successes and failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>.
*   **Scalable Design**: Projects should consider scalability from the design process to ensure learnings and solutions can be applied to other contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:53:00">[28:53:00]</a>.
*   **Formal Mechanisms**: Developing and implementing formal mechanisms like sandboxes and testbeds can create a structured environment for experimentation and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:04:00">[29:04:00]</a>.
*   **Citizen-Centricity and Knowledge Sharing**: The UAE, for instance, focuses on being citizen-centric and sharing best practices and services globally as a core principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:42:00">[49:42:00]</a>. This knowledge sharing can also serve as a "testing of our tools" in different governmental contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:25:00">[51:25:00]</a>.

## Examples and Approaches

### The UAE Government Accelerators
The UAE's Government Accelerators program emphasizes taking innovative ideas from ideation to accelerated implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. It uses a "100 days or less" sprint model to pilot innovative solutions by empowering frontline employees and focusing on [[crossdisciplinary_collaboration_for_mission_success | collaborative work]] among different entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. The goal is to solve specific challenges, and towards the end of the 100 days, focus shifts to setting up a sustainability team to ensure the innovative solution is sustained and scaled to similar areas or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. This methodology is also shared with other countries through the Government Exchange Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:48">[01:13:48]</a>.

### Deep Space Food Challenge
An international collaboration between the Canadian Space Agency and NASA, this challenge incentivizes innovation in food production technologies that can meet the needs of space exploration while also addressing terrestrial needs like reducing food insecurity on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. This initiative demonstrates a "vertical ecosystem building" approach, bringing together diverse innovators focused on a specific mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. Despite legal and policy restrictions on financial awards, parallel prize competitions are run, with co-marketing and synchronized activities to foster [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | collaboration]] and leverage global energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>.

### Global Innovation Collaborative
This network and platform facilitates collaborations among city governments worldwide (e.g., Paris, London, New York, Berlin) to launch open innovation competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. It invites innovators to deploy solutions in local testbeds, aiming for more resilient and sustainable cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. The London Office of Technology and Innovation (LOTI) acts as a curator, organizing and facilitating engagement with local authorities and tech communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>. This "open call" approach not only identifies winning ideas but also exposes the public sector to the art of the possible, showcasing the potential of technology for future applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:13">[01:46:13]</a>.

## The Future of Cross-border Collaboration
Many of the largest global challenges today are inherently cross-border, necessitating new ways to collaborate even when processes, culture, or ecosystems pose difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>. Governments must increasingly work through procedural issues to develop strong partnerships, trust, and open collaborative relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>.

Key areas for future collaboration include:
*   **Net Zero Emissions**: Cities and nations need to achieve goals on decarbonizing, retrofitting old houses, and neighborhood energy, requiring many parallel experiments and quick learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>.
*   **Food and Water Security**: Regional and global challenges related to resource scarcity will drive a stronger need for [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-cultural collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>.
*   **Public Health and Education**: Designing discovery processes, open challenges, and structured experiments to test solutions and gather data for global health and education initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:58">[01:15:58]</a>.

The future of collaboration will likely involve "mini-lateralism" – collaborations among groups of countries around specific tasks, rather than relying solely on traditional multilateral bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:41">[01:35:41]</a>. This shift requires institutionalizing processes to avoid reinventing solutions and fostering enthusiasm among participants to overcome cultural problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>. Ultimately, the next decade's task is to leverage the internet, web, and data to organize [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | collective intelligence]] and make it a common practice across all government functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

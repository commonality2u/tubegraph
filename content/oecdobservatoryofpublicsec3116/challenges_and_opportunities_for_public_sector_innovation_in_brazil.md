Two recent OECD reports, conducted in partnership with Brazil's National School for Public Administration (Enap), provide an [[overview_of_oecd_reports_on_public_sector_innovation_in_brazil | overview of public sector innovation in Brazil]], focusing on its system and the necessary skills and leadership for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These reports stemmed from a 2015 Memorandum of Understanding between Enap and the OECD, initially leading to a 2016 review of digital government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Building on this success, two new reviews were initiated: one on innovation skills and leadership, and another on the innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The reports aim to consolidate insights and play a relevant role in upcoming reforms in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Context and Drivers for Innovation

Innovation is crucial for Brazil to meet its ambitions and solve complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. While innovation has occurred sporadically in Brazil, a more deliberate and systemic approach is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Government challenges, such as inequality, financial position, fighting corruption, and changing demographics, necessitate routine, ongoing innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Innovation, while not a "magic bullet," is a necessary component for effective governance today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Historical Journey of Public Sector Innovation

Over the past three decades, Brazil's public service has focused on areas sympathetic to innovation, including:
*   **De-bureaucratisation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>
*   **New Public Management** in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>
*   **Modernization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>
*   **Digital Transformation** and specific innovation needs in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>

Key characteristics of the Brazilian public service that emerge from this history include a very legalistic system, a strong emphasis on controls and fighting corruption, and a recurrent focus on de-bureaucratisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. While there is a strong emphasis on the citizen and impressive digital transformation efforts, innovation has not yet been fully integrated into the public service narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## [[Challenges in Public Sector Innovation | Challenges in Public Sector Innovation]]

The public sector, as an institution, inherently faces challenges that limit innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion**: This is a common issue in public sectors, as the institution is built to avoid negative feedback and focuses on what goes wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. This contrasts with the private sector, where pain can be tolerated for potential profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Complexity**: Innovation is inherently hard to do, regardless of sector, as it is an ongoing learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
*   **Lack of Systemic Approach**: Innovation has often been sporadic, driven by exceptional individual efforts, crises, or political commitments, rather than being systematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Directives emphasizing innovation, while helpful, are not sufficient to embed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Structural Bias**: The inherent biases of the public sector lean against innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Innovation**: In a large and complex system like Brazil with thousands of local government situations, disparate innovative approaches can risk overall coherence and interoperability at a national level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
*   **Leadership Support Gap**: While individuals may feel confident in their innovation skills, support from management and the organization's readiness for innovation are often significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.
*   **Legal Risks for Innovators**: Civil servants attempting innovation may face legal troubles due to unclear job descriptions or gray areas, making personal risk a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>.

## Developing a Deliberate and Systemic Approach

A deliberate and systemic approach to public sector innovation is needed to counteract these difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This approach requires considering three key aspects:
1.  Is innovation occurring to the extent needed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>
2.  Is the innovation occurring likely to provide the right mix of options? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>
3.  Is there a form of stewardship to ensure the innovation system is delivering as hoped? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>

### Models for Systemic Innovation

The reports use two models to illustrate systemic thinking:
*   **Determinants Model**: This model considers innovation driven by individuals, single organizations, or as a systemic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. If innovation isn't driven systemically, it falls to organizational or individual levels, becoming vulnerable and unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
*   **Innovation Facets Model**: This model identifies different types of innovation activity:
    *   **Enhancement-oriented**: Building on existing approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.
    *   **Mission-oriented**: Dealing with large, audacious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
    *   **Adaptive**: Responding to bottom-up changes on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
    *   **Anticipating**: Asking fundamental questions about future relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
    In Brazil's risk-averse environment, innovation tends to be pushed towards enhancement-oriented (incremental and uncontroversial) rather than more radical exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   **System Stewardship**: This refers to collective consideration of the whole system to ensure coherence and interoperability, especially in a large country like Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Currently, stewardship in Brazil is often implicit or circumstantial rather than explicitly recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

## [[Role of Innovation in Brazilian Civil Service Reforms | Role of Innovation in Brazilian Civil Service Reforms]] and Leadership

The report on skills and leadership links to broader [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_sector_reform | public sector reform]] by examining Brazil's civil service system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. A 2010 OECD report found the Brazilian civil service system to be rigid, fragmented, and lacking leadership and vision for future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. Innovation is seen as a rallying call for rethinking how civil services are fundamentally organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

### Why Focus on Senior Civil Servants?
Senior civil servants are pivotal for driving or enabling change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.
*   **Productivity and Efficiency**: Brazil's civil service is expensive (13% of GDP remuneration vs. OECD average of 10%; 30% of public expenditure vs. 20% OECD average) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. Effective leadership can ensure this investment is managed well to maximize output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.
*   **Public Trust**: A highly qualified, professional senior civil service correlates with greater integrity and higher public trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Support for Innovation**: Leadership support is critical for successful public sector innovation, and its absence is a significant barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.

### Skills and Competencies for Public Sector Innovation Leadership
The report identifies six core skills areas for public sector innovation, viewed from an organizational perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. Leaders need a workforce with these skills and the ability to activate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.

A survey of nearly 3,000 Brazilian civil servants indicated:
*   **Self-Assessment**: Middle-level confidence in their own skills, with stronger curiosity but less confidence in iteration and user-centricity (e.g., prototyping, behavioral insights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.
*   **Managerial Support**: Significantly lower perception of management's ability to support innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.
*   **Organizational Readiness**: Perceptions of organizational readiness fell between self-assessment and managerial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.

Workshops with innovators identified three main skills groups for public sector leaders, built on a foundation of public service values and ethics:
1.  **Business Skills**: Aligning resources with needs, using management tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.
2.  **Innovation Skills**: Leaders need to understand how to support iterative processes, data science, and create space for professionals to use these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
3.  **Mindsets**: Empathy, empowering civil servants and citizens, continuous learning, courage, and understanding digital approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.

### Senior Civil Service System: Supply and Demand
Most OECD countries have a structured senior civil service system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. This report proposes a supply and demand model:
*   **Supply Side (Building Leaders)**:
    *   Clearly define required skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>.
    *   Provide opportunities to develop these skills (current and future leaders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
    *   Map the workforce to identify existing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.
    *   Create a learning culture for continuous skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.
*   **Demand Side (Calling for Leaders)**:
    *   Implement merit-based appointment processes that use innovation-related criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>.
    *   Provide ongoing support through training, performance, and accountability mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.

In Brazil, there's significant effort on the supply side (e.g., various innovation training initiatives led by Enap), but very little on the demand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. This is partly due to Brazil's political system, where appointments have traditionally been made at the will of the president and ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>. Building demand requires political buy-in and politicians relinquishing some autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

## [[Challenges and opportunities in public sector innovation | Opportunities for Public Sector Innovation]]

Brazil has several existing strengths and areas of opportunity for innovation:

### Existing Achievements
*   **Innovation Awards**: Provide rich insight into innovation, underscore the value of public service, and inspire others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.
*   **InnovaGov Network and Innovation Week**: Excellent mechanisms for socializing innovation, connecting people, and building momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   **Collaboration among Major Actors**: Demonstrated by joint sponsorship of the OECD report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.
*   **Growth of Innovation Labs**: Across different agencies, these labs highlight how to test new approaches and foster new thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation Agenda**: Played a crucial role in highlighting the value of change and offers a model for broader system-level transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

### Key Areas of Opportunity for Advancing the System
The report suggests opportunities categorized by audience:
*   **Whole System (All Actors)**:
    *   Establish an explicit agenda for public sector innovation, clarifying what is wanted and how it will be supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
    *   Give more attention to structural drivers to offset inherent inertia and bias against innovation (e.g., audit focusing on risks of *not* innovating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
    *   Assign explicit responsibility for stewardship of the public sector innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
*   **Central Actors (e.g., Enap, Ministry of Economy, TCU)**:
    *   Large agencies should have explicit roles in supporting the system's functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
    *   The Ministry of Economy should clarify links between public sector innovation and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
    *   Control bodies like TCU should identify how control processes (audit, risk management) can support innovation instead of being a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
    *   Enap could partner with other actors to develop an annual high-level commentary on system performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
*   **Individual Agencies**:
    *   Publicize innovation priorities within their operations to guide internal staff and external collaborators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

### Recommendations for Skills and Leadership (Immediate, Second Stage, Longer-Term)
*   **Building Supply (Networking & Leadership Development)**:
    *   **Immediate**: Enap and others should develop a hub to unify initiatives, map existing efforts, and include sub-national levels and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
    *   **Second Stage**: Use this network to develop a more unified innovative leadership competency model through a collaborative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.
    *   **Longer-Term**: Align the broader ecosystem of leadership development, ensuring training is responsive and transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Conduct skills analysis to align training offers with the competency model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.
*   **Building Demand (Merit-Based Hiring & Performance)**:
    *   **Immediate**: Develop merit-based hiring practices for senior positions, building on recent presidential decrees establishing minimum criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. Better understand where these practices are already used successfully within federal administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.
    *   **Second Stage**: Enap could pilot support for merit-based hiring and recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.
    *   **Longer-Term**: Scale up and embed merit-based hiring in legislation carefully, avoiding rushing that could reinforce negative narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>. Incorporate innovation-oriented objectives into job profiles and performance assessments for senior civil servants, giving them clear roles and protection for undertaking innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.

### Role of Universities and [[Open Innovation and its Application in the Brazilian Public Sector | Open Innovation]]

*   **Public Universities**: While not a specific focus of the report, universities can provide insight into identifying problems, generating new solutions (technology, policies, practices), and offering rigor in evaluating implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. They also play a "crucial role" in feeding the pipeline of public servants and leaders, requiring stronger linkages with government to attract and prepare talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. There is an overlap between innovation policies and policy innovations where universities can be more fluidly engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:49">[01:15:49]</a>.
*   **[[Open Innovation and its Application in the Brazilian Public Sector | Open Innovation]]**: This can be a valuable tool, recognizing that solutions may come from outside government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>. However, its value changes based on the context; it's effective for clear aims where external solutions can be integrated, but less so for exploratory or adaptive innovation where questions are less defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>. Brazil is experimenting with [[open_innovation_and_its_application_in_the_brazilian_public_sector | open innovation]] through challenge platforms that allow public sector organizations to solicit solutions and offer awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>.

The reports provide useful prompts and starting points for discussion, aiming to foster a more mature public sector innovation system that is systemic, consistent, deliberate, and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. This marks a continuation of discussions rather than a conclusion, emphasizing ongoing learning and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.

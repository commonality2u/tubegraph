Implementing innovation, particularly through portfolio approaches, often necessitates significant organizational change. This shift involves altering established processes, behaviors, and even the fundamental culture of an organization to foster a more adaptive and collaborative environment for innovation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>

## The Necessity of Change
Traditional models of innovation, often characterized by grant funding incremental projects or single-point solutions, are deemed insufficient to address complex, pressing issues like climate change, which require transformative action. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a> A portfolio approach, which focuses on interventions within systems and catalyzing broader change, demands an agile and responsive organizational structure. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>

## Specific [[Challenges and strategies in implementing innovation | Challenges]]
### Overcoming Silos
A significant hurdle to implementing a portfolio approach is the pervasive issue of silos within large organizations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a> These departmental or functional divisions can hinder effective collaboration and the integration of diverse innovation efforts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>

### Addressing Internal Biases
Organizations, particularly government agencies, may have inherent biases shaped by their traditional remits (e.g., focusing on industrial sectors due to ministry alignment). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a> There can also be an inherent bias towards funding as the primary solution, rather than exploring other forms of collaboration or resource optimization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>

### Shifting Behaviors and Culture
The implementation of new innovation approaches, such as a portfolio approach, often leads to significant behavioral and cultural shifts within the organization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a> This process can push individuals out of their comfort zones, leading to discomfort, but it is essential for learning and adapting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>

### Adapting Business-as-Usual Processes
Innovation initiatives are not merely additions; they change existing "business as usual" processes, systems, and steps, creating a broad ripple effect across the organization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>

## Strategies for Organizational Change
### Systemic and User-Centered Approach
Instead of organizing around government structures or traditional industry sectors, a more effective approach is to organize around "reality" or specific systems (e.g., mobility, health, food). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a> This "user-centered" or "place-based" approach brings together diverse actors who naturally "collide" in real-world contexts, facilitating cross-disciplinary and multi-level relationships. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>

### Starting with a "Coalition of the Willing"
Rather than initiating change with a top-down mandate for radical organizational restructuring, it is more effective to start by building a "Coalition of the Willing." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a> This involves identifying and engaging individuals or teams within existing silos who are supportive of the new process. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:44">[01:15:44]</a>

### Problem Framing Before Organizational Solutions
Organizations should prioritize sense-making and problem framing to define the issues at hand before prescribing organizational solutions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a> This adaptive approach allows the organization to evolve based on learned experiences. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>

### Leveraging Projects as Organizational Prototypes
Innovation projects themselves can serve as "prototypes" for what the future organization might look like. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a> By working through projects, organizations can sketch out new multidisciplinary departments or collaborative structures, rather than designing them a priori. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>

### Building Collective Intelligence and Diverse Perspectives
Decision-making and sense-making processes should actively seek and integrate a diversity of voices from different parts of the organization and external community. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a> This collective intelligence helps to address inherent biases and ensures a broader understanding of complex problems, as no single expertise is sufficient. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>

### Capacity Building and Perspective Exploring
Alongside bringing diverse people to the table, organizations should invest in internal capability building and perspective exploring. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a> This helps individuals recognize and work with biases, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>

## The Role of Leadership
A new type of leadership, known as "systems leadership," is emerging, focusing on enabling transformation rather than traditional, static, role-based authority. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a> This leadership involves:
*   **Collaboration:** Leaders collaborate to achieve collective transformation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>
*   **Empowerment:** Granting the organization the mandate to adapt processes, structures, and networks based on new learnings and experiences. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>
*   **Letting Go of Control:** Acknowledging that leaders may not always have the "right answer" and being willing to let go of the assumption of control. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>
*   **Comfort with Uncertainty:** Possessing the personal and behavioral trait to sit within uncomfortable uncertainty, which is inherent in complex innovation processes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41">[01:21:41]</a>

Ultimately, the aim is to build processes within the public sector that are less dependent on "hero leaders" and more on an inclusive, adaptive approach to innovation, fostering [[collective_system_change_through_innovation | collective system change]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>

> [!NOTE] This approach is still in its early stages and is described as "more of an art than a science." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a> Organizations are actively learning and adapting as they implement these new ways of working. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>

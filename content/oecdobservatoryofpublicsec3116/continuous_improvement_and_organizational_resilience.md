The Public Sector strives to design policies, regulations, and services in an inclusive, co-creative, transparent, accountable, and trustworthy manner, adjusting them to the needs of citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This objective necessitates a close connection between quality and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Research indicates that both quality and innovation are interconnected and should not be treated separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. A platform created by innovation helps organizations improve and be ready to innovate, setting a mindset that embraces change and moves beyond comfort zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## The Role of the Common Assessment Framework (CAF)

The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) has proven to be a significant aid for organizations, preparing them for uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. It supports constant learning and helps organizations understand their performance and workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This holistic approach to performance analysis transforms the mindset of both the organization and its staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. CAF is more than just a quality tool; it cultivates attributes that position public sector organizations to overcome disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

Organizations that have committed to the path of excellence using CAF or similar quality performance tools have consistently outperformed others, demonstrating that [[resilience_and_innovation_in_pandemic_response | innovation and resilience]] involve both thinking ahead and being well-prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

CAF's current 2020 model explicitly integrates innovation, mentioning it 50 times and reinforcing its presence from the 2013 version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. It is included in the principles of excellence, specifically Principle 6: "continued learning innovation and improvement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>. Furthermore, Criterion 2, related to strategy and planning, highlights the need to "manage change and innovation in an agile way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

## Lessons from the COVID-19 Crisis

The COVID-19 pandemic severely tested public administrations and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. Responses included:
*   Creation of new institutional structures and increased cross-ministerial coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.
*   Increased government expenditures as a share of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.
*   Approval of many emergency regulations, with exceptions to regulatory impact assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   Implementation of new health and sanitary protocols while maintaining productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.
*   Rapid digitalization of services and a widespread shift to teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>.
*   Development of new communication protocols and channels to combat misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

The crisis underscored the need for public sector organizations to focus on complex, multi-dimensional challenges, including economic recovery, protecting vulnerable populations, building a green economy, and ensuring debt sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>.

### Key Characteristics of Resilient Organizations

The Deloitte 2021 Global Resilience Report identified five characteristics of resilient and innovative organizations, all of which are embedded within the CAF model and its principles of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>:
*   **Prepared:** Organizations with clear short and long-term priorities and strategies outperform others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Adaptable:** Utilizing an adaptable workforce and flexible teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Collaborative:** Increasing collaboration both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Trustworthy:** Building trust between leaders and employees and ensuring transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Responsible:** Adapting beyond the bottom line in response to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Public administrations must strengthen their [[public_sector_resilience_and_transformation | resilience and agility in government]] to future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. Initial lessons highlight the importance of preparedness, agility, digital transformation, cultivating skills and capabilities for solving complex problems and innovation, developing foresight capacities, strengthening coordination and communication, and embedding cross-cutting challenges like the environment, inclusiveness, and digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>.

## Real-World Applications of CAF

### Vienna City Administration

Vienna's long-standing experience with CAF, spanning almost 20 years, highlights its role as a coach for [[organizational_habits_and_futures_thinking | organizational development]] and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>. Innovation requires a solid foundation of organizational development, continuous improvement, and systematic progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>. CAF aids in detecting maturity levels and closing the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, fostering continuous development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. This systematic improvement leads to greater organizational fitness, agility, and [[resilience_and_agility_in_government | resilience and agility in government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Working on small improvements contributes to larger systemic gains, providing a basis for innovation rooted in the expectations of citizens and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>.

CAF also serves as a "window to the world," facilitating mutual exchange of experience and development through the international CAF network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:45">[01:22:45]</a>.

### Krakow City Administration

Krakow's administration has conducted four CAF self-assessments since 2011, leading to significant improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. The latest assessment in 2017 focused on communication with clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:35">[02:27:35]</a>. Key initiatives included:
*   **Taxpayer Portal (2018):** An electronic tool offering an information platform on local taxes and a personalized communication channel for taxpayers, enabling online tax declarations and payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:08">[03:07:08]</a>. This significantly reduced telephone inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:48">[03:33:48]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Official Language (2019):** Guidelines and workshops were developed to help officials write and speak in a more inclusive and understandable manner, leading to improved customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:08">[03:11:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:53">[03:49:53]</a>.
*   **Parcel Lockers for City Services (2020):** Inspired by the COVID-19 crisis, this innovation allowed citizens to receive physical documents and items (e.g., license plates) via parcel lockers, reducing queues and providing access outside regular office hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:24">[03:14:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:24">[03:51:24]</a>. This is an example of [[crisisdriven_change_and_resilience_in_urban_environments | crisis-driven change and resilience in urban environments]].
*   **Integrated Contact Center (2021/2022):** A new unit designed to consolidate answers to questions about various city services and municipal units, addressing issues of long telephone queues and confusion about departmental responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:34">[03:13:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

CAF acted as a trigger, inspiring these innovations by focusing management and employees' attention on the area of client communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:31">[04:36:31]</a>.

### Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and Sports

The Slovenian Ministry, through its CAF self-assessment, identified a need for an employee survey to gauge satisfaction, climate, and understanding of the ministry's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:01">[04:09:01]</a>. This led to a voluntary, collaborative effort with seven other public organizations to create a uniform methodology for employee surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:06">[04:18:06]</a>. The objective was to gain organizational insight, provide information for strategic decisions, allow for comparisons, and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:04">[04:22:04]</a>.

The subsequent implementation and analysis of survey results, particularly using latent analysis to differentiate between satisfied and unsatisfied employees, helped pinpoint actionable areas for improvement in the working environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:55">[04:52:55]</a>. This demonstrated that CAF is a strong [[managing_innovation_in_complex_environments | management tool for strategic planning]] when results are properly utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:30">[04:53:30]</a>.

## Focus on Human Resource Management

A poll among session participants revealed that Human Resource (HR) Management is perceived as the most affected field by CAF implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. This aligns with findings from a Slovenian study on CAF's impact on HR management and people, which found a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. Lessons from the COVID-19 crisis, particularly regarding remote and hybrid working models, necessitate a different approach to HR management, including areas like knowledge management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. CAF helps organizations implement these necessary changes step by step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>.

## The Future of CAF and Continuous Improvement

The CAF model continues to evolve to support [[public_sector_resilience_and_transformation | public sector resilience and transformation]] in the EU member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. A project involving the OECD and multiple European countries aims to:
1.  **Look back:** Take stock of how public sector organizations managed the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>.
2.  **Look forward:** Highlight and promote innovations for more resilient public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>.
3.  **Support the CAF network:** Strengthen the model's use and facilitate new developments to the framework in the post-COVID-19 period, without reinventing the recently revised CAF model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

This ongoing work, including surveying CAF users, will identify main challenges and draw lessons to help organizations cope with future crises and become more resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. The aim is to contribute to [[feedback_and_iterative_improvement_process | continuous improvement]] and [[leadership_and_organizational_readiness_for_future_challenges | organizational readiness for future challenges]] by learning from collective experiences and acting on insights daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>.

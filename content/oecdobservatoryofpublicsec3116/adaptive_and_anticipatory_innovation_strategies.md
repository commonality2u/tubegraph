## What is Public Sector Innovation?
Public sector innovation is defined as something novel, implemented in its context, that results in a shift in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Innovation can vary significantly in scale (big or small), certainty of process, and origin (directed top-down or undirected bottom-up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Given its many facets, a framework is needed to understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The OECD Public Sector Innovation Model
The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation developed a model to categorize public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This model is based on two core features: how directed the innovation is, and the level of uncertainty in its process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. From these axes, four distinct facets of [[types_of_innovation_missionoriented_enhancement_adaptive_anticipatory | innovation]] emerge:
*   Enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Mission-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   [[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive Innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

## [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]]
[[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] aims to influence future developments before they become fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. An example of this is the current exploration of ethical and technological boundaries for artificial intelligence projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## [[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive Innovation]]
[[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]] involves exploring what is possible and discovering what could be or might be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. A relevant example is how social media has introduced new interaction methods between government and citizens, reshaping citizen expectations and creating new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## A Balanced [[innovation_strategies | Innovation Portfolio]]
Since innovation is multifaceted, there is no single, universal approach to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Focusing on only one or two facets can lead to unbalanced innovation efforts and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Therefore, governments require a balanced [[innovation_strategies | innovation portfolio]] that covers all facets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Modern governance increasingly emphasizes the critical role of [[interaction_between_governments_corporations_and_citizens | collaboration between governments, corporations, and citizens]] to effectively address complex and emerging challenges. This [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | cross-sector collaboration]] is seen as vital for strengthening democracy, fostering trust, and developing proactive, innovative solutions for the future.

## The Imperative for Citizen Participation

A fundamental shift from a reactive to a proactive governance model necessitates active [[citizen_participation_in_technology_governance | citizen participation]] and engagement throughout policy cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Governments must build systems that allow policymakers to learn from diverse approaches and ensure citizens have a voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:01">[02:35:01]</a>. Partnering with civil society, businesses, and other stakeholders is crucial for this integrated approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## Strengthening Trust and Democracy

Proactive governance, underpinned by robust [[Citizen participation in technology governance | citizen participation]], plays a crucial role in strengthening [[citizen_trust_and_public_communication | citizen trust]] towards government and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Conversely, anticipatory innovation governance can also strengthen the trust of government towards its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This reciprocal trust is vital for society, especially amidst growing pressures from democratic change, economic and social consequences of global pandemics, climate change, and the evolving digital environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Moving Towards Co-Creation and Co-Design

Historically, foresight and anticipation in government have been primarily linked to expert analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>. However, tackling complex challenges like sustainability and inequality requires more than just expert groups considering options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>. The shift is towards real-life co-creation and co-design approaches, where citizens and other stakeholders are proactively involved in policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:55">[02:22:55]</a>.

This involves:
*   **Wider Understanding**: Broadening the understanding of the urgency for governance system changes to meet rapid societal transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Motivating Political Decision-Makers**: Engaging political decision-makers in discussions that address issues within a wide social context and with broad social consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Openness of Public Actions**: Increasing the openness of public actions and actively involving citizens and other stakeholders in a proactive role in policy making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **Multi-Disciplinary Approaches**: Bringing together people from diverse backgrounds, including designers, ethnographers, and policymakers, to collaboratively create policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Case Studies and Approaches

### Finland
Finland is at an early stage of building a proper anticipatory innovation system, but is optimistic about creating a new governance model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Key building blocks include changes to strategic planning (e.g., strategic government program system from 2015), experience with experimentation, enabling legislation, widespread digitalization efforts, and adopting "ecosystemic approaches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. A current challenge is linking intensive foresight work with actual political decision-making and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:88:00">[01:88:00]</a>.

### Ireland
Ireland is also at the start of systematically introducing strategic foresight into its policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Their "Our Public Service 2020" strategy aims to consider future challenges and ensure the public service is fit for purpose by 2030 and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This involves identifying megatrends (like climate crisis, migration) and their impact across public service sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. The approach includes exploring strategic foresight tools, engaging with best practices from countries like Finland and Singapore, and building capacity through an action plan funded by the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. A critical aspect is linking strategic foresight insights directly into the wider policymaking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Sweden
Sweden aims for the whole country to be a "testing ground" for new work ways, technologies, and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. They use the concept of "regulatory greenhouses" rather than sandboxes, where different actors—agencies, companies, civil servants, civil society—can jointly test new things transparently and under real conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. This fosters a test culture that requires leadership, new governance, steering, and courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. They also propose a committee for municipalities, agencies, and regions to report regulatory problems hindering innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>.

### Basque Country (Gipuzkoa)
In the Basque Country, efforts focus on connecting anticipatory governance frameworks to a specific mission: accelerating a transition towards a more sustainable economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. This project distinguishes between traditional foresight and anticipatory innovation by combining traditional expert analysis with a portfolio approach that incorporates strong social and cultural initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. The aim is to build sense-making capabilities at different levels of action, from large-scale public sector initiatives to community-driven actions and small-scale startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>. This approach generates an infrastructure that can produce more innovative responses to emerging, unexpected problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.

### Norway
Norway is developing "seamless public services" for seven prioritized life events, which requires systemic innovation and digital transformation involving municipalities, county authorities, and central government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This project offers foresight/anticipatory innovation methodology and services, running workshops to test and learn with these live events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. By establishing an understanding of the voluntary sector and exploring future scenarios, they aim to make it easier to establish a common mission and align different stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>. This approach creates an "innovation space" for experimentation and cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:57">[01:24:57]</a>. They also consider digital ethics and privacy by inviting technical startups, private businesses, and the voluntary sector to develop solutions together, testing and learning collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>.

## Empowering the Public and Embracing Humility

For [[Collaboration and governance in digital services | collaboration and governance]] in digital services and broader societal challenges, there is a call to empower the people who are actually dealing with the problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:01">[02:21:01]</a>. This empowerment includes allowing them to use the future to envision their own future, becoming sovereign and capable of defining and addressing their own problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:12">[02:21:12]</a>.

Ultimately, humility is a key lever for driving this collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:13">[02:22:13]</a>. Leaders must be willing to admit they don't have all the answers and embrace a willingness to work together with an open mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:21">[02:22:21]</a>. This collective effort, moving beyond traditional hierarchical structures, is essential for governments to navigate and shape complex and uncertain futures responsibly.

### Key Organizations and Their Contributions
*   **OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI):** Focuses on making missions operational and accessible to civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. They have developed resources like the Mission Planning Canvas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a> and the [[Facets of Public Sector Innovation | Innovation Facets Model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a> to support context-aware methodologies for working with missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. OPSI also investigates emerging [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] practices on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
*   **UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose (IIPP):** Directed by Mariana Mazzucato, IIPP advances theoretical knowledge in mission-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. They focus on economic growth and the government's role in directing it towards equitable and green outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. IIPP collaborates globally through its Mission Oriented Innovation Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **European Commission:** Has been keen on applying the mission concept, particularly through reports authored by Mariana Mazzucato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Driving Forces for Missions in the Public Sector
The year 2020, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, brought the idea of mission-oriented innovation into sharper focus for many countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Governments realized their capacity to deliver quick recovery plans and direct economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This shift encourages governments to be proactive, welcome uncertainty, take risks, and adopt a long-term view in shaping the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Missions provide a new policy framework to reorganize policymaking, moving away from siloed government departments towards working together with the private sector for common goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The core idea is for government to take a dynamic approach to shape future markets, rather than solely focusing on market failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### [[Principles of public sector innovation | Principles of Mission Design]]
The European Commission report outlines five criteria for effective missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>:
1.  **Inspirational:** Missions should motivate wider audiences beyond mere percentages or targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
2.  **Clear and Targeted:** While inspirational, missions must also have clear, measurable targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
3.  **Investment in R&I:** Missions should include investment into research and [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
4.  **Cross-Sectoral and Cross-Disciplinary:** Missions should not be limited to technology, but also include behavioral aspects (e.g., how people eat, commute, dress) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
5.  **Multiple Solutions:** Governments should invest in multiple solutions rather than focusing on a single one, enabling a wider search for solutions by various actors (private sector, universities, NGOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. The government's role is to enable the space for solutions, not to dictate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## [[Challenges in Managing Innovation within Public Sector Organizations | Challenges in Public Sector Innovation]]
Participants identified several [[Challenges in Managing Innovation within Public Sector Organizations | challenges]] in implementing mission-oriented approaches:

*   **Defining and Communicating Missions:** How to make missions both inspirational and clear/targeted, understandable for a wide audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Breaking Silos:** Moving from siloed government departments to cross-ministerial and cross-disciplinary collaboration is crucial but difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Evaluation Methodologies:** Assessing mission impact is complex, as it involves creating new markets and outcomes beyond simple cost-benefit analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   [[Challenges in public sector innovation funding | Risk and Reward Distribution]]: Determining who invests and who benefits from the mission's outcomes, particularly highlighted by the race for vaccines during COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **"Mission Washing":** The risk of simply redefining existing policies as missions without fundamentally changing approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   **Governance Redesign:** Missions require a redesign of governance structures to support cross-policy and cross-ministerial approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.
*   **Gaining Mandate and Legitimacy:** Public sector innovators often struggle to get the mandate to lead activities and networks beyond their immediate organizational boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.
*   **Overcommitment:** The need to balance ambitious goals with realistic implementation plans, avoiding overcommitment upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.
*   **"Lock-in Effect":** The danger of only engaging with core teams, leading to missed opportunities from external stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.
*   **Internal Resistance:** Overcoming resistance from those sticking to old mindsets and bureaucratic norms is a persistent challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>. This often stems from rational reasons within organizational feedback systems that punish ambitious goals without sufficient resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>.
*   **Capacity Imbalances:** Mission-oriented change can force new ways of working, potentially leading to significant staff turnover if individuals are unwilling or unable to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>.

## Roles of Different Actors
### Governments and Public Sector Organizations
Governments are expected to play a proactive role in shaping economies and directing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This involves:
*   **Long-Term Vision:** Shifting from short-term, siloed goals to long-term, cross-cutting policy objectives, like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.
*   **Coordination:** Missions facilitate coordination across ministries and agencies towards common goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   **Innovation:** Public sector organizations need to become more innovative themselves, not just funding external innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.
*   **Policy Reframing:** Missions serve as a reframing tool to address 21st-century problems and build new government structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>.

### Civil Servants
Civil servants play a crucial role in operationalizing and even setting missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. They need methods and working approaches to prepare and implement missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. They must learn to build networks and lobby partners to gain necessary levers of control, even if a mission extends beyond their direct mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.

### Citizens and Civil Society Organizations
Active engagement from citizens and civil society organizations (CSOs) is vital for mission success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.
*   **Bottom-Up Input:** CSOs can drive mission-oriented innovation by providing input from the ground, especially in democracies with strong civil societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   **Sustained Support:** Missions often extend beyond political cycles, requiring broader societal support to maintain momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>.
*   **Legitimacy and Buy-in:** Engaging society from the outset leads to stronger public buy-in, ensuring missions resonate with people's daily experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.
*   **Social Movements:** Movements (e.g., climate change activism) can bring critical issues to the forefront, compelling politicians to adopt them as missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>.

## Examples of Mission-Oriented Initiatives
*   **Vinnova (Sweden):** Actively engaged citizens in developing missions for healthy and sustainable food and sustainable mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. They focused on tangible changes like decarbonizing food habits and making streets more livable, prototyping changes quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
*   **Health Holland (Netherlands):** Set a mission for all Dutch citizens to live at least five years longer in good health by 2040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. This involves participatory experimental processes across different domains and regional contexts, acknowledging that complex behavioral change requires ongoing adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.
*   **Spain (National Innovation Agency):** Worked on increasing sustainable mobility while reducing aggregate mobility, aiming for more compact cities with lower carbon footprints, requiring coordination across different ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.
*   **Royal Academy of Engineering (UK):** Emphasized not overcommitting upfront, but rather exploring possibilities and understanding existing capabilities in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. They advocate for a flexible approach to achieve concrete mission goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[Challenges and opportunities in public sector innovation | Public sector innovation]], driven by mission-oriented approaches, requires a fundamental shift in how governments operate. It demands cross-sectoral collaboration, dynamic policymaking, new evaluation methods, and deep engagement with citizens and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. The journey is one of learning and adaptation, as there are no single "best practices" but rather emerging, diverse approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

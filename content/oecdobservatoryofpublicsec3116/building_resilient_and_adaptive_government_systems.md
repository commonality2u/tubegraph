Governments globally face a world characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and novelty (VUCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The problems public organizations deal with are inherently complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, with new developments, both technological and otherwise, constantly emerging from the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This necessitates that governments respond adequately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> and be prepared to define the potential future they wish to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## The Innovator's Dilemma in Government

Established practices and policies in government, like in the private sector, can become outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This is because environmental conditions change and new ideas emerge that render previous systems less relevant or necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Incorporating "disrespectful information" – ideas that challenge the status quo – is difficult because current stakeholders often provide information based on existing services, not future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

New ideas are rarely perfect at the outset and may underperform existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Furthermore, an organization's strategic intent can work against anticipation, especially when leadership is preoccupied with current challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. There is also natural resistance to change, as organizations are accustomed to current performance and may not want dramatic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. However, ignoring new transformations is not a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

A core challenge for the public sector is the "Collingridge dilemma," where the possibility to control change is much larger in the early phases of technological development, but evidence of potential impacts increases only in later phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. For example, early on, there was more opportunity to influence the development of platform economies like Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, but once millions of users adopt a technology, it's very difficult to roll back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This means governments must think about technological and non-technological changes early to influence their values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

Governments often view the future from a static perspective, using traditional futures cones as a one-time exercise for strategy development, rather than as a continuous practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Relying on five different scenarios, for instance, can lead to five different ways of being wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. To be truly [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipatory]], there must be a continuous practice of using strategic foresight knowledge for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

## The Need for Anticipation

Futures are created through present dialogue, influencing what the future might be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | Anticipatory innovation]] involves looking at future trends and possibilities, but taking action in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This includes experimenting and developing ideas to test possibilities to avoid being caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

**Strategic Foresight** is an important part of [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipating innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. It provides input into anticipation by identifying signals of upcoming developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. However, strategic foresight often operates in silos within governments, leading to an "impact gap" in translating insights into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. Insights may be ignored if they challenge current practices or if there's no clear mechanism to enforce their integration into action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The focus must be on designing engagements for those who will implement the insights, not just for the practitioners' own satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

> "The amount of time your leadership is dealing with current challenges of things that are now on the table may actually take away from looking at the risks or opportunities that are upcoming." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>

A notable example of this impact gap is the COVID-19 pandemic. As recently as 2017, governments had good scenarios regarding international pandemics, yet very little action was taken based on this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. This led to a "tactical zone" in 2020 where adaptation to the crisis was necessary rather than strategic anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

## Distinguishing Key Concepts

It is crucial to understand the differences between resilience, adaptation, and anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>:

*   **Resilience** aims to make a system more prepared for external shocks, allowing it to expand without breaking and uphold its core values and properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | Public Sector Resilience and Transformation]] is about maintaining function.
*   **Anticipation** can inform when a system should *not* be resilient, indicating a need for fundamental change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. It's about building new structures to respond to new challenges rather than clinging to an outdated system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.
*   **Adaptation/Agility** refers to the capacity to react tactically and adaptively to ongoing changes, often in the midst of a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. It involves quickly testing and measuring different possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. [[Adaptive innovation in public services | Adaptive innovation in public services]] is responsive.

[[Anticipatory innovation for governments | Anticipatory innovation]] strengthens both resilient and [[Adaptive innovation in public services | adaptive capacities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. It helps governments question if they are moving in the right direction, addressing the right challenges, and if tactical adaptations foreshadow bigger necessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

## Building an [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] System

An [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] system is a framework of structures, institutions, agencies, and environments that supports the creation and application of future-oriented knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. It aims to bridge the gap between foresight and actionable innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

This framework involves two key sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>:
1.  **Agency**: Building the capacity to anticipate and innovate, transforming anticipatory knowledge into action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. This addresses vested interests and cognitive biases through public participation, networks, skills, and capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.
2.  **Authorizing Environment**: A feedback system that provides data, measurement, and learning to evaluate if explored ideas are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

Key characteristics for effective [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipatory innovation governance]] systems, identified through work with governments like Finland, include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>:
*   **Demand**: A leadership culture that actively seeks strategic foresight and anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
*   **Capacity**: Developing knowledge and skills, such as having horizon scanners and scenario planners embedded within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   **Embeddedness**: Coordinating anticipatory activities with other system elements like electoral cycles and policy reviews, ensuring insights are implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
*   **Institutions and Teams**: Establishing specific teams or units responsible for [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipatory innovation]] that connect with broader organizational functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.
*   **Feedback**: Systems to evaluate how well anticipation was used and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

Finland, for instance, has multiple teams and institutions throughout its government, including a parliamentary committee and a community that brings together government, non-government, and academic organizations for strategic foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

Initial work with governments focuses on understanding and mapping their existing systems to outline necessary roles and capacities for [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>. This includes understanding how strategic foresight information can be transformed into a digestible format for exploring options and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>. It's important to provide autonomy to critical thinking teams whose job is to challenge the main organization and its "business as usual" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>.

### Case Studies

*   **Sweden (Vinnova & Helsingborg)**: Vinnova, Sweden's innovation agency, was an early supporter, allowing the OECD to analyze its innovation portfolio and contribute to the "sea thinking" of anticipatory innovation governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The city of Helsingborg consciously decided to become an anticipatory organization, starting by building leadership capacity in city managers and politicians to discuss futures and foresight, and then supporting [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipatory innovation]] projects as test beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.
*   **Ireland**: The OECD is working with the Irish government to understand what their [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipatory innovation governance]] system would look like, defining roles and coordination mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.
*   **South Africa**: During its transition from apartheid, a set of scenarios called the "Morphet scenarios" were developed and shared with senior decision-makers, including Nelson Mandela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a>. These scenarios reframed decisions and led to positive outcomes, demonstrating how strategic foresight practices can navigate political instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Leadership and Culture
Leadership interest in [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipatory innovation]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>. However, it's an inherently political challenge as leaders making decisions about uncertain futures face political risk and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. There's often an aversion to challenging assumptions and values, as the future might reveal current approaches are wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. Strong, open-minded leaders are needed to welcome such challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

Biases, such as expert bias and the "minimal squeak behavior" (ignoring problems until they become crises) also need to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>. The tendency to treat policy problems as linear and to present oneself as the sole expert must change to effectively address uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

### Technology and Innovation
Innovation is often seen as a discipline solely related to technology, but it is increasingly multi- and transdisciplinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. [[Anticipatory innovation for governments | Anticipatory innovation]] requires looking at technology from a human-centric or system-design perspective, understanding how its design influences human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. While technology enables changes like centralization or decentralization, human and social contexts also call for specific technological solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. Technology should serve a goal towards preferable futures, not be a goal in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>.

### Mission-Oriented Innovation
Mission-driven innovation focuses on a single, agreed-upon purpose, like decarbonizing an economy by a specific date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>. This provides a clear goal that legitimizes and drives innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>. However, [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipatory innovation]] is crucial even within mission-oriented approaches to account for the unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>. This includes anticipating new technological solutions that might be more successful or unforeseen side effects of mission-driven changes, such as job displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.

## Conclusion

The OECD has been working on [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipatory innovation governance]] for about two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Future work includes releasing an overview of the concept and a working paper with references on methods for creativity, legitimacy, and exploring different futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>. Projects are underway to explore mechanisms for building agency and an authorizing environment that supports and evaluates this work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>. Key initiatives include a demonstration case in Finland, work on the future of the public sector with Slovenia, and building anticipatory ecosystems around technologies with Latvia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.

A core challenge remains how to make decisions and take actions without evidence, which is central to [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipatory innovation]] and requires a different type of measurement and evaluation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>.

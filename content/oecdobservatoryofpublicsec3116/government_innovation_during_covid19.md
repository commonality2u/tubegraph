The "Government Aftershock" initiative was launched as a collective learning exercise to explore the future of government in the wake of the [[Government responses to COVID19 and innovation | COVID-19 pandemic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This global enterprise involved a co-design process with over 60 stakeholders and hosted more than 65 events worldwide, engaging over 5,500 participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The initiative aimed to share key insights by asking three core questions: what to leave behind, what to keep, and what to do differently given what was learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Reimagining Government in the Wake of COVID-19

Over the past decade, the relationship between people and government has become increasingly strained due to global shocks, which have eroded citizens' trust in their government's ability to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The [[Government response to COVID19 | COVID-19 crisis]] brought into sharp focus the imperative for governments to operate differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The Center for Public Impact (CPI), a not-for-profit foundation, works to "reimagine government so that it works for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This vision entails a government that embraces complexity, relationship building, and experimentation for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Change-makers across various levels of government and frontline public services are pioneering a new vision based on three core beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>:
1.  Most societal challenges are complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
2.  The quality of human relationships is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
3.  Progress is best achieved through experimentation and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

These beliefs have given rise to new values and principles that guide the future of government, particularly in rebuilding a [[Government innovation and collaboration postpandemic | post-COVID-19 society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>:
*   Think systematically but act locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   Share power with those best placed to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Challenge unnecessary hierarchy and collaborate across boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   Seek out strengths and build on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   Champion the voices of those heard the least <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   Optimize for learning rather than control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

The [[Government responses to COVID19 and innovation | COVID-19 recovery]] presents a powerful opportunity to bridge the gap between government and its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Key Insights and Themes

The "Government Aftershock" events revealed several consistent themes regarding government's response to the crisis:

### What to Keep Doing
*   **Creating Community and Cross-Sectoral Collaboration:** Initiatives like Government Aftershock foster community and facilitate cross-sectoral collaboration, breaking down silos within and across governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Sam Ray of Conservation Volunteers Australia noted a "much more joined up thinking and more collective learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Shortened Feedback Loops in Frontline Services:** The direct and faster feedback loops between frontline services and central government were a welcome side effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Jennifer McAteer of Groundswell highlighted the benefit of feeding community needs to NHS England in real-time, noting that bureaucracy often disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### What to Leave Behind
*   **Short-Term Thinking:** The crisis offered an opportunity to think beyond political cycles and short-term solutions, moving towards more long-term, systems-based discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Rigid Ways of Working and Siloed Thinking:** Failures in the [[Public Sector Innovation in Response to COVID19 | public sector response]] were often attributed to rigid ways of working, the misconception that government has all the answers, and practices that inhibit systems thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Misha Core of the Australian Taxation Office suggested the need for "unlearning" old assumptions and mental models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### What to Start Doing
*   **Building Relationships in Unexpected Ways:** There has been significant cross-sectoral and cross-silo interaction, fostering new relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Jerome Harvey of the Tope Project emphasized the "art of listening" and the importance of government leaders demonstrating vulnerability to build trust with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Focus on an Inclusive Recovery:** The pandemic, alongside movements like Black Lives Matter, presents an opportunity to reimagine and restructure economies to be more inclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### Sustaining Innovation and Addressing Challenges
The [[Government responses to COVID19 and innovation | COVID-19 pandemic]] demonstrated government's capability to innovate, be agile, adapt, work remotely, and collaborate across silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. The challenge is to sustain this agility beyond individual efforts and embed it into the entire system and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

Key areas for continued focus include:
*   **Rapid Digital Transformation and Data Use:** Governments and society digitized overnight out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. However, this necessitates human-centric regulations, data privacy, transparency, and digital rights at the core of every strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. Digital approaches should not replace human elements, and inclusion must be prioritized to avoid leaving people behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. It's crucial not to simply transpose physical processes online, but to critically reflect on whether these methods are truly optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **Collaboration:** [[Government innovation and collaboration postpandemic | Collaboration across government levels, country borders, and societal sectors]] was essential during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. The question remains how to sustain this when immediate common problems are less apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. Strengthening local government networks, supporting their work, and integrating them into governance processes are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. Private and non-profit sector collaboration through hackathons and challenge-based procurement also needs to continue beyond crisis scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>. A poll indicated 72% of respondents believe it's more important for national governments to work with each other now than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>, highlighting the cross-border nature of modern challenges.
*   **Trust and Transparency:** Trust is critical for the success of government measures during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. Governments adapted their communication strategies to be more human-centered and inclusive, reaching communities normally overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. Increased openness about uncertainty and a willingness to make decisions based on available knowledge contributed to increased trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. This human side of communication and inclusive participatory processes need to be sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
*   **Policy Priorities and Inclusion:** The crisis exposed gaps in welfare policies, creating opportunities to explore new programs like Universal Basic Income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>. Issues of gender-based violence and systemic racism also came to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>. The focus must be on improving citizens' well-being and building inclusive, sustainable economies and societies, with people at the center of policy and government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. As quoted, "people are not hard to reach, they're seldom heard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.
*   **Approaching Futures and Uncertainty:** The complex challenges faced this year highlight the need to proactively explore uncertainty and the future, rather than being caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. This requires adopting new methods and investing in approaches that move beyond pure risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. A poll revealed strong appetite for "anticipation and futurist thinking," "systems approaches," and "agile and adaptive working methods" as innovation methods to gain more traction beyond [[Government responses to COVID19 and innovation | COVID-19]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

While governments demonstrated impressive capabilities, there were also areas where performance was not up to scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. The pandemic revealed the need for new measures and skills to evaluate government activities and decisions in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. It forced a realization that outdated structures, like back-end bureaucracies remaining rigid despite front-end digitalization, are no longer viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. Public institutions must move beyond simply delivering services to becoming "managers of well-being," creating environments where people feel safe and trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

### A Pivot Point for Change
The crisis emphasized that there is "no time" to lose in making necessary changes, particularly as future shocks like climate change and more pandemics are anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. This is a "real pivot point" for government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.

A poll asking if government was eager to return to the old normal or willing to learn showed a concentration towards being "willing to reflect on lessons learned but less willing to take action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. Therefore, the ambition is to ensure that the gravitational pull of previous default settings does not revert governments to an unsatisfactory state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. The goal is to connect, empower, and legitimize efforts within and outside government to demand better, knowing what has been learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.

The "Government Aftershock" initiative itself served as a "collective learning prototype," demonstrating a different way of sense-making and encouraging widespread engagement to drive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. This is an ongoing process that seeks to provide actionable guidance, futures thinking best practices, and inspiration for what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>.

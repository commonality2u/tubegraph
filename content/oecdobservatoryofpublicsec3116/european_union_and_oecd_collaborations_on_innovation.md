The European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have established a long-standing partnership focused on advancing public sector innovation. This collaboration is crucial for governments worldwide to tackle complex policy challenges and adapt to rapidly changing circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Historical Partnership and Support

The EU's engagement with public sector innovation dates back to 2013, when an expert group report recommended EU investment in supporting governments' internal innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Based on this, a partnership with the [[oecds_role_in_public_sector_innovation | OECD]] was established in 2015 to investigate public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This support continues via the European Union's research and innovation framework program, Horizon Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This partnership is driven by a shared belief that innovation is core to government's ability to increase agility, responsiveness, public value, and the quality of services to citizens, especially during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Key Achievements and Initiatives

Over seven years, the [[cocreation_process_with_oecd | collaboration]] has yielded several tangible achievements:

*   **[[oecds_role_in_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] Platform**: Established to showcase case studies and offer a "toolkit navigator" for public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Declaration for Public Sector Innovation**: Adopted in 2019, it currently has 43 signatories, demonstrating a commitment from governments to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Mission Action Lab**: A dedicated initiative fostering mission-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Network of National Contact Points**: This network brings together practitioners from government administrations to share experiences on [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | public sector innovation]] and address sensitive issues challenging the status quo, such as the relationship between political leaders and civil service, or framework conditions for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The partnership has successfully opened up the often cautious government context to facilitate experience sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. A significant outcome has been the shift from merely listing ideas to implementing concrete actions like innovation weeks, trainings, and prizes, influencing core government business and policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Focus Areas

Governments face critical challenges, including:
*   The "permacrisis" involving multiple parallel crises (health, energy, climate, geopolitical dependencies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   A crisis of the welfare state model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   Tight public finances, inflation, and potential recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   Rising public demand for engagement, accountability, and democratic governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

To address these, radical changes are needed in working methods, including flexibility, digitization, and hybrid models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Public administrations must [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation | collaborate with citizens]] and other actors in the innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. There is a need for new organizational frameworks conducive to innovation and capacity building, and a long-term strategic approach that spans political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Focusing solely on adaptation or incremental improvement will not suffice; a "step change" is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The EU has experimented with designing five missions under Horizon Europe, practicing a mission-oriented innovation approach that engages all innovation ecosystem actors in "game-changing common endeavors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## The [[oecds_role_in_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] Innovation Facets Model and Portfolio Approach

The [[oecds_role_in_public_sector_innovation | OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation]] ([[oecds_role_in_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]]) has developed a model highlighting four key facets of public sector innovation, which are needed for different goals and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>:

1.  **Mission-Oriented Innovation**: Addresses complex challenges by setting ambitious, targeted, and time-bound goals for transformative change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This requires strong leadership commitment and effective governance tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.
2.  **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation**: Focuses on continuous improvement and efficiency, often driven by austerity, auditing, and performance measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
3.  **Adaptive Innovation**: Aims to build agility and responsiveness into organizations, enabling experimentation and quick reactions to new situations or citizen needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
4.  **Anticipatory Innovation**: Involves a future-oriented stance, using strategic foresight to anticipate risks and opportunities and inform decision-making about future transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

The collaboration advocates for a **portfolio approach** to innovation, which means managing a mix of these different innovation types rather than focusing on a single one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This approach helps:
*   Avoid "lock-in" in innovation practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>.
*   Develop a distribution of responsibilities and coordinate knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>.
*   Tailor projects for different risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>.
*   Prevent fragmentation between projects and build synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>.
*   Tackle risk aversion and perceived failure in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>.

The [[oecds_role_in_public_sector_innovation | OECD]] offers tools like the "portfolio explanation tool" and "portfolio mapper tool" to help organizations visualize and balance their innovation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:11">[02:02:11]</a>.

## [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | International Collaboration in Government Innovation]] and Case Studies

The EU-OECD partnership actively promotes [[crossborder_government_collaboration and innovation | cross-border government collaboration and innovation]] and knowledge exchange.

*   **Korea**: The [[oecds_role_in_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] report and its multi-faceted model are highly valued in Korea for guiding public sector managers and policymakers. They see the model as providing an envision statement for linking government innovation strategy to high-level public sector reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:40">[02:05:40]</a>. The report also helps in involving civil society stakeholders as strategic partners to create greater synergies and reinforce national agendas across government levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:59">[02:06:59]</a>. Korea has a strong focus on data-driven public administration and evidence-based policymaking, using quantitative and qualitative approaches, often relying on "open innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:33">[02:53:33]</a>.
*   **Austria**: Austria has utilized the [[oecds_role_in_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] facets model as an abstract background model for discussing various innovation approaches in projects and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:50">[02:03:50]</a>. Examples include:
    *   The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) for quality management as an example of enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:46">[02:04:46]</a>.
    *   "Finance Online," an online portal for taxpayers, showing how repeated incremental innovations lead to significant development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:48">[02:05:48]</a>.
    *   "Future of Work" and "Digital Public Administration and Ethics" projects are classified as anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:32">[02:06:32]</a>.
    *   The "Greening Commutes and Duty Travels" project is a mission-oriented innovation example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   **Sweden (Lund)**: Future by Lund, an innovation platform, has adopted a portfolio approach using the [[oecds_role_in_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] facets model overlaid with its "zone model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:03">[02:04:03]</a>. This approach helps in:
    *   Providing a holistic view for all stakeholders in the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:35">[02:04:35]</a>.
    *   Identifying gaps and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:35">[02:04:35]</a>.
    *   Tracking accumulated projects over time and visualizing the ecosystem's strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:35">[02:04:35]</a>.
    *   [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | Collaborating across municipality, companies, and universities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:09">[02:04:09]</a>.
*   **European Commission (Internal Transformation)**: The European Commission's Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, responsible for Horizon Europe, is undergoing an organizational transformation journey to embed innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:55">[02:19:55]</a>. Despite lacking an overarching innovation strategy, individual services foster "smaller pockets of innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:18">[02:18:18]</a>. The shift to a "strategic investment mentality" and [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | collaboration]] with stakeholders, moving beyond a traditional consultation culture, is a key challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:32">[02:18:32]</a>.
*   **United Arab Emirates (UAE)**: The UAE government, through the Mohammed Bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation, views a portfolio approach to innovation as "second nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:42">[02:04:42]</a>. They set ambitious visions, launch transformative programs (M1 and M2 projects) with performance contracts, and are part of the Agile Nations Network to try untested ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:42">[02:04:42]</a>. Their [[international_collaboration_on_innovation | international collaboration on innovation]] with [[oecds_role_in_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] since 2016, through the "Edge of Government" initiative, involves collecting hundreds of innovative cases globally to enrich their portfolio and showcase best practices at events like the World Government Summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:42">[02:04:42]</a>.

The [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | international collaboration on governance innovation]] and sharing of experiences across countries and organizations are vital for developing robust approaches to [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | public sector innovation]]. The latest [[oecd_reports_on_innovation_in_public_administration | OECD reports on innovation in public administration]] provide comprehensive insights into these efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:24">[02:00:24]</a>.

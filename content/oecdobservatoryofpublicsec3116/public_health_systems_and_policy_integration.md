The COVID-19 crisis has served as a critical test for public health systems globally, revealing both strengths and vulnerabilities and prompting a re-evaluation of future reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The "Government After Shock" event, an OECD initiative, aimed to gather insights from various localities worldwide to draw general lessons about what practices should be left behind, what should be kept, and what should be done differently given the new understanding of systemic vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Health System Readiness and Adaptability

The pandemic forced incredibly rapid changes, particularly in the use of technology, staff re-qualification and redeployment, and the application of behavioral change strategies for public communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Latvia
Despite having one of the worst-funded health systems in the EU, Latvia managed a "miracle" by regrouping, reorganizing, and leveraging its best resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Key to their success was a strong, "old school" epidemiological service for testing and tracing, and excellent cooperation with private service providers to dramatically increase testing capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This highlights that people can be more innovative than institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Ireland
Ireland's system was not ready for the scale of change, facing shortages of critical care beds and grappling with a new health reform program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. However, the willingness of staff, especially nursing staff, to undertake training and support intensive surge capacity preparations was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Most routine elective care was deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Key challenges included sufficient primary care staffing and recruiting for dedicated testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Korea
Korea's success in managing the crisis, with relatively low daily new confirmed cases, can be attributed to three factors:
1.  **Capacity for Diagnosis**: Early enhancement of PCR testing capacity, enabling over 25,000 tests per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
2.  **Existing Data Infrastructure**: Leveraging a national health insurance system covering 100% of the population with a single unified payer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This included a national drug utilization system for real-time tracking of prescriptions and a mask distribution system to curb panic buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
3.  **Governance of Relevant Organizations**: All relevant organizations, including local governments, were linked under a central disaster management headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

These capabilities were supported by a single unified national health insurance system, advanced information infrastructure, and lessons learned from the MERS crisis in 2015, which led to the development of a crisis management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The public's widespread use of facial masks due to prior experience with smog and pollution also contributed to lower transmission rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. This highlights that health system resilience is deeply linked to pre-existing healthcare delivery and universal operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.

### Sweden
Sweden focused on scaling up ICU capacity, doubling it and maintaining available capacity from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. They made a "frog leap" in creating a [[public_sector_and_technology_integration | digitalized health system]], delivering services digitally for follow-up visits, remote monitoring, prescriptions, and consultations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Accurate information and effective communication were key to building public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. The crisis also fostered tighter [[multilevel_governance_and_collaboration_in_urban_policymaking | collaboration]] within Sweden's traditionally fragmented health system, bridging gaps between national, regional, and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

### Israel
Israel, despite a thinly stretched healthcare system with tight spending and nearly 100% bed occupancy, benefited from a long-standing pandemic contingency plan that had been drilled several times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Key aspects of their response included:
1.  **Proactive Protection of Vulnerable Groups**: Early and intensive efforts to inform and protect the elderly and those with chronic diseases, significantly reducing their proportion among infected individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
2.  **Early Mass Diagnostic Testing**: Free, large-scale PCR testing, maintaining one of the highest global rates (over 80,000 tests per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.
3.  **Timely Adaptation of Hospital Care**: Early understanding that avoiding ventilation was beneficial, along with optimized supportive care and proning, contributing to one of the lowest case fatality rates globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
4.  **Rapid Transition to Online Care**: Leveraging existing digital health infrastructure to shift focus to chronic disease management and proactive preventive medicine through remote means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.

## Managing the "Double Burden"

A significant challenge during the pandemic has been managing the "double burden" of COVID-19 care alongside essential non-emergency services, which were often cancelled during initial lockdowns, leading to increased mortality from other conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

### Latvia
In spring, Latvia immediately closed all planned services to free up hospital capacity for COVID-19, which heavily impacted accessibility, despite low COVID-19 case numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. Now, they are reorganizing designated COVID bed capacities by shrinking ambulatory care rather than planned care, aiming to keep the healthcare system open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. A major problem is the shortage of healthcare workers, as many work in multiple places, making it difficult to restrict worker flow without shutting down services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. They are also developing home healthcare, including portable oxygen monitoring systems and leveraging general practitioners for home services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

### Ireland
Ireland faced challenges with key workers self-isolating and staff weariness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>. They rolled out [[public_sector_and_technology_integration | telehealth]] and online consultations in GP practices and outpatient clinics, fast-forwarding the implementation of electronic prescription transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. A COVID-19 tracker app was also introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. The country saw significant [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | community support]] in health and well-being, with a focus on prevention and a "keep well" campaign involving local authorities and sporting organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>. The health budget for well-being increased from 6 million to 20 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

### Sweden
Sweden's approach deliberately avoided a full lockdown to consider all health perspectives and mitigate negative impacts on overall public health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. This included keeping schools open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. While the first wave required reallocating resources, stopping screening programs and elective surgery, and saw many patients avoiding appointments, the health system has "bounced back" in the second wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. There are no current statistics showing an increase in suicidal rates or mental health illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. The healthcare workforce is tired, but applications to medical and nursing programs have increased by 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. There is an increased need to invest in preventive measures and public health to tackle waiting times, not just through surgical interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

### Israel
During the second wave, Israel handled the double burden differently than the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. Hospitals did not stop elective procedures, and there was a strong emphasis on maintaining community-focused care, primary health care, and [[public_sector_and_technology_integration | preventive medicine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. A proactive approach involved identifying patients at high risk of deterioration using predictive analytics and having physicians proactively reach out to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

### Korea
During a period of high prevalence in Daegu, Korea divided care facilities into three levels: general hospitals for severe COVID-19 patients, "living care centers" for low-level care, and home isolation with regular checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Hospitals were designated for specific types of diseases (COVID-19, other respiratory diseases, other non-pulmonary diseases) to separate patient tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. No increase in 30-day mortality for myocardial infarction was observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>.

## Policy Integration and Future Directions

The crisis has increasingly shown that public health is a complex public policy issue, inextricably linked to the economy, jobs, education, public transport, and other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

### Ireland
Ireland's budget increased public health funding by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. The government is looking at alternative approaches, including e-medicine, online consultations, and tackling obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. A "keep well" campaign promotes mental health, physical activity, and community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>. Political decisions largely followed expert advice, recognizing that the pandemic accelerated [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | innovation]] in public health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. The health service feels empowered, and there is a genuine public appreciation, creating an opportunity for improved collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

### Latvia
The Latvian Minister hopes the crisis will permanently end the "health versus economy" discussion, a false dilemma that has persisted for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. Adequate pandemic response and future effectiveness require implementing a universal health care approach and health promotion, which are strongly tied to socioeconomic factors like well-being, household situation, and environmental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>. The health care system impacts only around 20% of population health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. Politicians find it challenging to follow expert advice fully due to the unpleasant decisions required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. There is a commitment to tackling inequalities, as lack of savings motivates people to work even with mild symptoms, undermining restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.

### Sweden
The crisis has largely accelerated existing trends like digitalization, patient-centeredness, and health system [[intergovernmental_cooperation_and_policy_integration | collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. It has also forced rethinking, particularly regarding societal dependency on timely delivery and the need for better preparedness, adaptive systems, and quicker reactions to new crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. There's a recognized need to work much better with [[public_sector innovation and crosssector collaboration | civil society]] and industry, building new pathways for medical equipment and pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>. Personally, the Director General aims to speed up processes, increase the use of data from registers for research and statistics, and provide clearer, more focused messages on priorities to providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

### Korea
The crisis has led to a realization that Korea's largely private sector-dependent healthcare system may need to be redesigned towards a more public sector-dominant model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. This implies not just accelerating existing trends but fundamentally rethinking what constitutes a "good health system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>. The pandemic highlighted the importance of safety, seen as a form of [[role_of_public_sector_and_international_collaborations_in_health_innovation | human security]] at the national level, emphasizing that health issues are deeply linked with other sectors of human security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. The commitment is to building a sound healthcare delivery system with universal coverage to prepare for future crises and ensure a resilient and prepared health system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

### Israel
The pandemic served as the "best accelerator" for digital health, swiftly overcoming bureaucratic resistance and unionistic worries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. Once digital, there's no turning back to "analog medicine," and the focus will shift towards a new equilibrium where digital care proportion will adapt to illness waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>. This involves a *[[integration_and_impact_assessment_in_behavioral_science_policies | redesign of care processes]]* augmented by digital capabilities, moving towards proactive, asynchronous, and precision medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>. There is a strong hope that governments will realize the economic impact of a barely sustainable healthcare system and invest in safety margins, as pandemics are here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>.

## Changes in Population Behavior
While specific lifestyle changes for chronic disease patients are still being monitored, some observed behavioral shifts include increased working from home, more family time, and higher savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>. These changes present opportunities for future public health initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>. There's a recognized need for international collaboration in dealing with global problems, as national responses alone are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.

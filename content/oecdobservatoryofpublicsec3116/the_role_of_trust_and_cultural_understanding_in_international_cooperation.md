International cooperation is increasingly vital in a world where problems have evolved from complicated to complex, and from local to global, demanding collective action across countries and policy fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. While government innovation efforts often remain within national or local borders, understanding and overcoming barriers to cross-border collaboration is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Challenges to Cross-Border Innovation

Research indicates that issues facing governments are increasingly complex and transboundary in nature, necessitating existing governance mechanisms to adjust and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Despite the clear need, [[challenges_in_fostering_international_cooperation | challenges in fostering international cooperation]] persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Key challenges include:
*   A lack of preparedness among governments to tackle global issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Only half of OECD countries have dedicated institutions for identifying novel or complex crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Weaknesses in [[international_cooperation_and_data_standards | international cooperation]], as highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   The perception among government agency personnel that they lack "permission" to engage in cross-border initiatives, fearing it deviates from their Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
*   Funding metrics that disincentivize co-investment, even when it would lead to more efficient outcomes for neighboring jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.

### Cultural Differences and Identity

A significant challenge is navigating cultural differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. Even within a single country, cultural variations between states can pose difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. People often work in a "tribal" manner, believing their immediate work is the most important, which hinders cross-border or cross-sectoral engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.

The instruments of globalization, such as the internet and social media, which were expected to foster global community, are sometimes polarizing societies instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. This can make communication more complicated and push people away from international discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.

## The Pivotal Role of Trust

[[The_role_of_trust_and_leadership_in_public_service | Trust]] is identified as a key factor in successful cross-border collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. It is crucial to build relationships between counterparts, particularly when they may not already know each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. This investment in relationships, even without an immediate acute issue, allows for easier future communication and problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

[[Trust_and_engagement_in_public_governance | Building public trust in institutions]] and the ability to be generous are essential for long-term regional benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## Fostering Cross-Border Cooperation

Governments are increasingly leveraging new structures, including innovative governance bodies, horizontal networks, and coordinated systems approaches to tackle global issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. These actions, combined with partnerships in industry and civil society, lay a new foundation for multilateralism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Examples of successful cooperation include:
*   **Quarken Council:** The first legal Nordic cross-border entity, leveraging cross-sector collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. The council has fostered over 100 projects and launched a new environmentally friendly ferry between Sweden and Finland, partly funded by the European Investment Bank (EIB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.
*   **Open European Dialogue:** A network of European parliamentarians collaborating through experimental dialogue methods to foster shared learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal:** A new governance system in North England and South Scotland that secured significant co-funding for a unified approach to inclusive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Elements for Success

*   **Shared Vision and Common Goal:** A clear, defined common problem or area for collaboration is essential for cooperation to gain results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.
*   **Relationships:** [[Trust and transparency in public governance | Relationships]] are fundamental in all aspects of public and private life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Permission:** Political and senior agency leadership must recognize and encourage cross-border efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
*   **Institutional Frameworks:** Formalized arrangements and legal artifacts can be necessary to overcome financial and other barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>. The European Union's platform has made it easier to collaborate and secure funding for projects that might otherwise struggle for national priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Financial Incentives:** Public banks and [[role_of_international_organizations_in_innovation_missions | international organizations]] play a crucial role in crowding in private financing by de-risking investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

## Skills for Cross-Border Public Service

To enable more public servants to engage in cross-border cooperation, it is vital to:
*   **Provide Permission and Investment:** Senior leadership must explicitly allow and invest in these efforts, recognizing their long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>.
*   **Facilitate Direct Experience:** Bringing public servants to border regions or problem areas allows them to understand issues firsthand and engage in problem-solving in a "safe practice" environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>.
*   **Develop Skills:** Cross-border work is a learned skill, not an inherent one. Training and exposure are essential to build this capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.
*   **Foster Engagement and Readiness to Change:** Individuals need a personal readiness to learn and adapt to new ways of doing things, even if it entails transaction costs initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>. This means looking elsewhere and doing with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.
*   **Embed Mandates:** Mandates, whether through law, regulation, or [[international_cooperation_and_data_standards | international standards]], can reinforce the requirement for cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.

### Addressing Uncertainty

In the face of uncertainty, such as the [[impact_of_covid19_on_international_cooperation | COVID-19 pandemic]], the solution is not to close off but to intensify cross-border engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>. Diverse actors, including states, regions, international organizations, private sector, scientists, and NGOs, are all crucial in addressing global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>. This approach allows for shared learning, risk-sharing, and pooling of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.

Demonstrating collective ability to tackle global challenges is essential to reinforce democracy and [[public_trust_and_governance | public trust in government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

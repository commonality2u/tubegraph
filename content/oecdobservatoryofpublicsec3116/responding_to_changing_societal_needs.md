Governments must innovate and change their approaches to deliver new or better value for their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This need for [[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | adaptive innovation in public services]] stems from several factors, including unresolved existing problems, a rapidly changing global environment, and the necessity to anticipate future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Reasons for Government Innovation

Governments need to innovate for three primary reasons:

### 1. Unsolved Problems
Governments have not yet solved all the problems faced by their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges | Innovation is necessary]] to develop more impactful solutions and better address these existing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### 2. A Changing World
The world is constantly evolving around governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Many foundational government systems, such as healthcare, welfare, and taxation, were designed in the 1950s and no longer align with today's realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Key aspects of this changing environment include:
*   **Digitalization** People now engage with services online and expect the same ease of experience when interacting with government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Evolving Needs** The needs and lifestyles of citizens have changed significantly since the mid-20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Governments must adapt to new systems emerging from technological advancements and digital use, while also responding to the changing needs of societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### 3. Anticipating Future Challenges
Governments must look forward and prepare for fundamental changes and uncertainties that lie ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This includes [[addressing_complex_challenges_like_climate_change_and_aging_populations | complex challenges like climate change and aging populations]], as well as anticipating the emergence of new types of societies that are not yet fully formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Future-oriented thinking and [[adapting_science_and_technology_for_societal_challenges | different kinds of thinking]] are required to be ready for tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

In summary, governments need to innovate to be more impactful, adapt to the evolving environment, and proactively anticipate future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

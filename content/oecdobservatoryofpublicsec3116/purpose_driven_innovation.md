[[missionoriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is synonymous with purpose-driven innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This approach to innovation is characterized by a clear and defined purpose for why innovation is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The core idea is to solve a specific challenge or societal problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Characteristics
Purpose-driven innovation involves setting clear goals that dictate the reason for innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. From these goals, numerous new ideas can emerge that might prove beneficial in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Example: The Moonshot
A prominent example of [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] and, by extension, purpose-driven innovation, is the moonshot mission to reach the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This endeavor had an unequivocal goal: either the moon was reached or it wasn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Every component within the system, such as NASA, was designed and implemented to achieve this specific mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Innovation Outcomes
The moonshot directly resulted in a significant amount of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Furthermore, various other types of innovations emerged as side effects of this [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The ultimate objective, in this case, was the successful landing on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

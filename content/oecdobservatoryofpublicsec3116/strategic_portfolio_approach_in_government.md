The strategic portfolio approach in government is vital for tackling complex policy challenges and driving meaningful public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It provides a structured way to manage diverse innovation initiatives, ensuring they collectively contribute to broader strategic goals and address emergent challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Evolution and Importance of Innovation

The European Union has supported public sector innovation for years, initiating an expert group report in 2013 that called for EU investment in government innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This led to a partnership with the OECD in 2015, focusing on [[public_sector_innovation_strategies|public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Over seven years, significant achievements include the setup of the OPSY platform (showcasing case studies and offering a toolkit navigator), the adoption of the Declaration for Public Sector Innovation (with 43 signatories by 2019), and the establishment of the Mission Action Lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. OPSY has also fostered a network of national contact points, encouraging the sharing of experiences and addressing sensitive issues like the relationship between political leaders and civil service or framework conditions for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This work has helped influence the core business of government, moving beyond initial lists to actions like innovation weeks, trainings, and prizes, thereby influencing policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Why Innovation is a Must

Governments today face numerous critical challenges, often described as a "perma-crisis," encompassing health, energy, climate, and geopolitical dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The welfare state model is also in crisis, compounded by tight public finances, inflation, and potential recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Simultaneously, public demand for engagement, accountability, democratic governance, and deliberation is rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. These pressures necessitate radical changes in working methods, such as flexibility, digitization, and hybrid models, and require administrations to work collaboratively with citizens and the innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. New organizational framework conditions conducive to innovation and capacity building are needed, along with a long-term strategic approach that bridges several political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Relying solely on adaptation leads to reactive modes and delayed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Incremental improvements in existing systems are insufficient to address underlying institutional problems; a "step change" is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. For example, e-government work emphasizes cutting red tape rather than just digitizing existing bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. One approach for this step change is designing missions that engage all innovation ecosystem actors in game-changing common endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Key Messages of the Strategic Portfolio Approach

The latest OPSY report highlights several key messages regarding a strategic portfolio approach to innovation:

*   **Innovation is Core to Government:** Innovation is fundamental to a government's ability to increase agility and responsiveness, enhance public value, improve service quality for citizens, and achieve better spending, especially during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. [[Public sector innovation methods and strategies|Innovation in the public sector]] ultimately improves lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a> and is core to restoring trust in government and democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Professionalization of Public Sector Innovation:** In recent years, [[public_sector_innovation_strategies|innovation in the public sector]] has become more professionalized, with countries institutionalizing practices and concrete measures to support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Agility and Foresight:** Governments not only need to be more efficient but also develop greater agility to adapt, more foresight to anticipate, and increased ability to guide their missions and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. This includes setting long-term transformational goals through approaches like [[integrating_missionoriented_approaches_in_government_and_policymaking|mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Management:** Managing innovation as a portfolio of initiatives working together towards common goals is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This approach goes beyond managing several individual projects, instead focusing on managing risks across public sector activities and generating synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. It can be likened to the portfolio approach of venture capital firms, exploring risk and innovation areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## OPSY's Innovation Facets Model

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSY) has developed a model based on the premise that different situations and goals require different types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Governments need a mix of these innovation types, managed as a portfolio, to avoid being stuck in specific approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

The four key innovation facets are:

1.  **Mission-Oriented Innovation:** Needed to address new, complex challenges and fulfill public sector goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. It requires political commitment to ambitious, targeted, and time-bound challenges, instigating purpose-driven systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Governance tools and institutional entrepreneurship are essential for successful implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
2.  **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation:** Focuses on continuous improvement, especially given public money stewardship and austerity conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Strong drivers come from auditing, evaluation, and performance measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. A key challenge is preventing this facet from dominating the entire [[innovation_portfolio_management_in_public_sector|innovation portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
3.  **Adaptive Innovation:** Emphasizes agility to respond to citizens' needs and unforeseen situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. It requires building adaptive capacity and organizational frameworks that allow continuous experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. This involves making resources available, fostering the right culture, and granting civil servants license and time to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
4.  **Anticipatory Innovation:** Focuses on future outlook, anticipating what is coming to build strength against future challenges and develop collective visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. It uses strategic foresight as input for decisions on new opportunities and risks, requiring "transformation units" to explore, experiment, and generate evidence for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

A balanced [[innovation_portfolio_management_in_the_public_sector|innovation portfolio]] across these facets helps avoid "lock-in" to specific practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. It enables a distribution of responsibilities, coordinated knowledge, and tailored projects for different risk types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. Furthermore, it combats fragmentation, reduces risk aversion, and builds crucial synergies between actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. OPSY offers tools like the [[portfolio_exploration_for_public_sector_innovation|Portfolio Exploration Tool]] and Portfolio Mapper to help organizations visualize and balance their innovation projects for strategic decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

## Country Examples of Implementation

### Korea

Korea emphasizes political support as crucial for successful government innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. The multi-faceted innovation approach helps integrate different views and interests, build consensus, and increase support for the [[public_sector_innovation_strategies|public sector innovation]] agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. It also helps involve civil society stakeholders as strategic partners, fostering greater synergies and reinforcing the national agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. The approach helps set a national vision linked to broader public sector reform and innovation objectives, ensuring political leadership commitment, inter-ministerial coordination, and engagement across government levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

Despite the Ministry of Interior and Safety's vital function in public sector innovation, there's a need to translate, contextualize, and re-engineer concepts for Korean public health managers and civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. Partnerships with the Prime Minister's office, Ministry of Personnel Management, and think tanks are crucial for disseminating these approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. Both [[integrating_missionoriented_approaches_in_government and policymaking|mission-oriented innovation]] and [[strategic_foresight_and_innovation_in_government|anticipatory innovation]] are highly important, leveraging data, technology, social media, and platforms to improve accountability, inclusiveness, and digital government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This also strengthens ties between public and private sectors, extends partnerships, and develops business cases and experimental approaches for sustained funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. Risk management is crucial, especially concerning future social, economic, security, and privacy issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. Korea extensively uses data science and behavioral insights for experimentation and demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. The country relies heavily on open innovation approaches and cooperates intensely with think tanks, research institutes, and academic societies to measure government behaviors and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>. The Ministry of Interior and Safety annually creates and shares thousands of case studies to understand what types of innovation are necessary and sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.

### Austria

Austria uses the OPSY facets model as an abstract reference for discussing various aspects of projects and in training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. It is also used for mapping projects and instruments. For example, the Common Assessment Framework (CAF), a widely used quality management tool in Europe, is classified as enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. Another example of enhancement-oriented innovation is "Finance online," a portal allowing taxpayers to carry out actions online, which has seen continuous improvements over 20 years, including the integration of a bot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. These examples show that even incremental innovations, when carried out repeatedly, can significantly contribute to organizational development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>.

Projects like "Future of Work" (a real-life lab exploring mobile work forms in central administration) and "Digital Public Administration and Ethics" (defining ethical standards for digital technologies) are classified under [[strategic_foresight_and_innovation_in_government|anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. A "Greening Commutes and Duty Travels" project, aiming to avoid unnecessary travel and shift to eco-friendly transport, is mapped as [[integrating_missionoriented_approaches_in_government and policymaking|mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. While the model is used for mapping, reflection, and training, Austria currently does not use it as a strategic framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>.

### Sweden (Future by Lund)

Future by Lund, one of Sweden's Innovation Platforms, employs an ecosystem approach, working with external actors across the municipality, companies, universities, and research institutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. This approach recognizes that most societal challenges require the action of multiple actors, not just the municipal organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. They focus on fostering collective sense-making processes and developing innovative solutions from these networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

Future by Lund uses a "zone model" (yellow, green, red zones) to demonstrate different types of innovation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.
*   **Yellow Zone:** Unclear mandate, ideation, experimentation phase, based on relations and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
*   **Green Zone:** Ideas develop, partnerships form with a shared mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.
*   **Red Zone:** Clear mandate for a single organization to make decisions on funding and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
These processes can move back and forth between zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>. Future by Lund primarily operates in the yellow and green zones, consolidating ideas and forming consortia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>. The OPSY Innovation Facets Model is overlaid with this zone model, providing an international vocabulary to discuss and move projects forward across zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>.

The strategic portfolio approach provides a holistic view for all ecosystem stakeholders, showing how activities contribute to broader system change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>. It enables the identification of gaps and opportunities, tracks accumulated projects over time, and visualizes the strength and assets of the entire ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

## [[Challenges and Strategies for Effective Innovation Portfolio|Challenges and Strategies for Effective Innovation Portfolio]]

Implementing a strategic portfolio approach faces several challenges:

*   **Embedding Innovation into Regulatory Frameworks:** Integrating innovative projects beyond pilot phases into standard regulatory frameworks is a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.
*   **Measuring Success vs. Tracking:** Traditional measurement of success (e.g., number of implementations, specific outcomes) can be difficult in complex systems with multiple actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>. A shift towards "tracking" portfolios – documenting activities, investments, and events – can help understand impacts on engagement and mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>.
*   **Organizational Readiness for Missions:** While there's much experimentation around missions, less thought is given to whether mission-oriented policies require mission-oriented organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Specific capabilities and attention to organizational setup are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Orchestration:** Modern missions require galvanizing the entire ecosystem, not just top-down directives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. Public sector organizations are often not well-equipped for stakeholder engagement due to concerns about favoritism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.
*   **Building Dynamic Capabilities:** The "perma-crisis" environment demands public sector organizations develop dynamic capabilities to proactively shape issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>. This requires investment in HR and training, which is often overlooked in funding mission-oriented projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.
*   **Strategic Investment Mentality vs. Public Spending Mentality:** Large administrations, like the European Commission, often lack an overarching [[Innovation Strategies for Governments|innovation strategy]] or centrally coordinated approach, leading to fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. A shift from a public spending mentality to a strategic investment mentality is needed, along with system thinking, strategic collaborations, and hands-on engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>.
*   **Co-creation vs. Consultation Culture:** Many administrations have a consultation culture, but [[integrating_missionoriented_approaches_in_government_and_policymaking|missions]] and a portfolio approach require co-creation with ecosystem players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>. This represents a steep learning curve for those pioneering new approaches within existing administrative environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.

### Recommendations for Starting

To initiate a strategic portfolio approach, organizations should:

*   **Start with Sense-Making:** Gain a clear understanding of current activities and how they relate to the organization's intent or mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:34">[01:27:34]</a>. This includes noticing gaps, available resources, and capabilities within the specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53">[01:27:53]</a>.
*   **Embrace Diversity of Approaches:** Organizations often have monolithic understandings due to homogenous staff backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56">[01:28:56]</a>. Encouraging diversity in sense-making, perhaps by dedicating time for staff to learn new approaches, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">[01:29:07]</a>.
*   **Build New Capabilities:** Innovation is a fundamentally strategic process that requires organizations to build new capabilities to manage different forms of innovation, strategic decision-making, and integrate knowledge into policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>. Portfolios of strategic options can act as learning systems, helping organizations understand where they need to be in a system to effect change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>.
*   **Foster Internal Transformation:** Initiatives like creating a single budget line across programs can force collaboration and define shared goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>. Participatory leadership, staff engagements, and "Matrix teams" can empower staff and break down silos, leading to co-created visions and structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:53">[01:21:53]</a>. Regularly dedicating time for internal reflection weeks can address strategic questions and simplify procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>.

## Global Perspective: UAE

The UAE government exemplifies a strategic portfolio approach to innovation, considering it "second nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a>. They set ambitious visions, applying pressure to deliver, which naturally fosters innovative and diverse responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:18">[01:31:18]</a>. They launch transformative programs (e.g., "M1" and "M2" projects) with ministers signing performance contracts for delivery within 6-12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The Ministry of Possibilities works on [[integrating_missionoriented_approaches_in_government_and_policymaking|mission-oriented innovation]] to solve wicked policy challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>. As part of the Agile Nations Network, they are not afraid to try untested ideas, evidenced by launching the world's first regulatory authority for digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:49">[01:32:49]</a>.

The UAE collaborates with OPSY on the "Edge of Government" initiative, collecting hundreds of innovative government cases globally to enrich their portfolio and showcase best practices at the World Government Summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:09">[01:34:09]</a>. This effort demonstrates a commitment to collecting learning and avoiding a focus solely on incremental change or safe bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>. This global analysis identified over 4,000 public sector innovation cases in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:19">[01:36:19]</a>.

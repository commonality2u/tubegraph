This article provides an overview of two recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports focusing on [[Public Sector Innovation Introduction | public sector innovation]] in Brazil. The presentation was delivered by Alex Roberts and Daniel Gerson from the [[Role and Functions of OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation | Observatory of Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI), alongside Guillerme de Melo from Enap (Brazil's National School for Public Administration). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>

## Context and Origin of the Reports

The reports emerged from a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) executed in 2015 between Enap, the Brazilian national school for public administration, and the OECD. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> This collaboration previously led to a 2016 review on digital government, which introduced new visions for Brazil's e-governance processes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>

The current reports address two key areas:
*   Updating capacity building for 21st-century skills for civil servants. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Promoting an ecosystem for [[public_sector_innovation_introduction | public sector innovation]] in Brazil. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>

Brazil has a history of engaging with innovation, including "Innovation Awards for Public Sectors" since 1996 and the creation of "Inovagov," a network of over 100 public, private, and academic organizations interested in [[public_sector_innovation_introduction | public sector innovation]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> The reports, completed through multiple missions, consultations, and interviews, focus on [[Role of Innovation in Brazilian Civil Service Reforms | innovation skills and leadership in the Brazilian public sector]] and the innovation system of the Brazilian public service. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> They were launched at the fifth edition of Brazil's Public Sector Innovation Week. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>

A significant aspect of the reports' development was their continuity across a change in political administration in Brazil (started under one, concluded under another after 2018 elections). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> The external perspective of the OECD helped maintain the relevance and continuity of both agendas through this transition. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>

Future challenges include translating, refining, and disseminating the reports to a wider Brazilian audience to foster discussion and consensus on their findings and proposed next steps in capacity building and ecosystem development. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>

## Report 1: The Public Sector Innovation System in Brazil

This report examines how Brazil can adopt a more deliberate and systemic approach to innovation, moving beyond sporadic or reactive activities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>

### Key Messages
*   **Need for Innovation**: Brazil requires innovation to achieve its ambitions and solve pressing problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>
*   **Systemic Approach**: While innovation has occurred, a deliberate and systemic approach is essential to ensure innovation happens to the extent needed, with the right mix, and with proper stewardship. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
*   **Continuous Effort**: Much has been achieved, but more is required for the Brazilian public service to consistently and reliably innovate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>

### Why This Report?
Innovation must be at the core of government operations, not merely a side activity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> The complex and significant challenges faced today demand routine, ongoing innovation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> Despite examples of innovation (e.g., through long-standing awards), it has not yet been systemic. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>

### Drivers for Innovation in Brazil
Brazil has many reasons to adopt a more considered approach to innovation, including:
*   Addressing inequality. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>
*   Improving the government's financial position. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>
*   Fighting corruption. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>
*   Dealing with changing demographics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>

### Brazil's Innovation Journey
Over the last three decades, Brazil has focused on areas conducive to innovation:
*   **De-bureaucratization**: Emphasis on efficiency and streamlining processes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>
*   **1990s**: Focus on new public management and reforms for government effectiveness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>
*   **Later**: Period of modernization in government. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>
*   **Last Decade**: Attention to digital transformation and innovation needs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>

The history reveals recurring patterns in the Brazilian public service: a legalistic system, strong emphasis on controls and anti-corruption, and a citizen-centric approach. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a> While digital transformation has been impressive and innovation has gained momentum, it's not yet fully integrated into the public service narrative. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> Directives and laws mandating innovation are helpful but insufficient to embed a practice of innovation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> The system needs to balance its structural emphasis on processes with a focus on innovation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>

### Challenges to Innovation in the Public Sector
Innovation faces inherent challenges in the public sector:
*   **Risk Aversion**: Public sectors are built to avoid negative feedback; failures are remembered more than successes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> This differs significantly from the private sector, where profit potential can offset risks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>
*   **Complexity**: Innovation is difficult in any sector, requiring continuous learning and adaptation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>

A deliberate and systemic approach is needed to counterbalance these difficulties and inherent biases against innovation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a> This means moving beyond innovation driven solely by individual efforts, crises, or political commitments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>

### Requirements for a Deliberate and Systemic Approach
This approach requires three considerations:
1.  Is innovation occurring to the extent needed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>
2.  Is the innovation occurring likely to provide the right mix of options and choices? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>
3.  Is there a form of stewardship to ensure the innovation system delivers as hoped? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>

### Models for Understanding Innovation
The report uses two models to illustrate its thinking:
*   **Determinants Model**: Identifies drivers of innovation activity:
    *   **Individuals**: Often seen in Brazil, but "luck-driven," unsustainable, and vulnerable to individual turnover. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>
    *   **Single Organizations**: Innovation solves that organization's specific problems, not systemic issues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>
    *   **Systemic Activity**: Integrates collective interests into the innovation process, which is the desired goal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a> The aim is to move innovation from individual to organizational and then to systemic levels. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>
*   **Innovation Facets Model**: Describes different types of innovation activities:
    *   **Enhancement-oriented**: Building on existing approaches, doubling down on what's already there. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>
    *   **Mission-oriented**: Addressing big, audacious goals (e.g., putting a man on the moon). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>
    *   **Adaptive**: Bottom-up responses to changing circumstances on the ground. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>
    *   **Anticipating**: Asking fundamental questions about current practices and future needs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>
    In Brazil, due to a risk-conscious environment, innovation often leans towards enhancement-oriented approaches, raising the question of whether this mix is deliberate or unintended. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>
*   **System Stewardship**: Refers to the collective consideration of the entire innovation system. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a> In a large and complex system like Brazil with thousands of local governments, individual innovative approaches can create tension at the national level, highlighting the need for coherence and interoperability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>

### Findings on Brazil's Innovation System
*   Much innovation is driven by individuals or organizational perspectives, not systemic ones. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>
*   There's a lack of emphasis on underlying determinants that shape systemic activity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>
*   The current structure pushes innovation towards incremental and uncontroversial forms, despite a need for more radical exploration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>
*   Existing stewardship is implicit or circumstantial, not officially recognized or explicit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>

### Scenarios for the Future
The report explores three scenarios to test assumptions and illustrate potential dynamics, without advocating a specific path:
1.  **"What is"**: How the system might continue on its current trajectory. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>
2.  **Building upon existing efforts**: What if current measures were taken further? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>
3.  **Innovation at the center**: What if innovation became a core focus with significant emphasis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>

### Achievements in Brazil
The report acknowledges significant successes in Brazil's innovation journey:
*   **Innovation Awards**: Provide rich insight, underscore public service value, and inspire others. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>
*   **Inovagov and Innovation Week**: Excellent mechanisms for socializing innovation, connecting people, fostering learning, and building momentum. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>
*   **Collaboration**: Strong collaboration among major actors in the system (e.g., joint sponsorship of the report). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>
*   **Innovation Labs**: Growing number of labs across agencies highlight testing new approaches and thinking. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>
*   **Digital Transformation**: Has played a key role in demonstrating the value of change and serves as a model for broader system-level transformation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>

### [[Challenges and Opportunities for Public Sector Innovation in Brazil | Opportunities for Advancement]]
The report highlights key areas of opportunity, categorized for different audiences:
*   **Whole System**:
    *   Establish an explicit agenda for [[public_sector_innovation_introduction | public sector innovation]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>
    *   Give more attention to structural drivers for innovation to offset inertia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>
    *   Assign explicit responsibility for stewardship of the public sector innovation system. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>
*   **Central Actors**:
    *   Major agencies should have an explicit role in the system's functioning. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>
    *   Ministry of Economy: Make clear links between [[public_sector_innovation_introduction | public sector innovation]] and digital transformation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>
    *   Control Bodies (e.g., TCU): Identify how control processes (audit, risk management) can support innovation, not hinder it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>
    *   Enap: Partner with actors across the ecosystem to develop annual high-level commentary on system performance to be shared at Innovation Week. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>
*   **Individual Agencies**:
    *   Identify and publicize innovation priorities within their operations to guide internal staff and external partners. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>

These suggestions are intended as useful prompts and starting points for discussion, recognizing that the system is fast-moving and influenced by many factors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>

## Report 2: Skills and Leadership for Innovation

This report, developed in conjunction with the first, addresses the need for specific skills and leadership within Brazil's public sector to foster innovation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>

### Background and Rationale
A 2010 OECD report on Brazil's civil service found a rigid, difficult, and un-agile system with many disparate careers and a lack of leadership vision. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a> The concept of innovation now serves as a rallying call to rethink the fundamental organization of civil services globally. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a> Senior civil servants (DAS five and six positions, or FCPE equivalents in Brazil) are pivotal in driving or enabling change. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a> The 2010 report noted a lack of coherence in managing these positions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>

### Importance of Focusing on Senior Civil Servants
*   **Productivity and Efficiency**: Brazil's civil service is expensive (13% of GDP compared to OECD average of 10%; almost 30% of public expenditure compared to OECD average of 20%). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a> Effective management and leadership of this investment are crucial to maximize productivity and ensure talent is used to meet pressing needs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>
*   **Public Trust**: There is a clear link between perceptions of integrity in public service and public trust. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a> A highly qualified, professional senior civil service is an indicator of less corruption and greater public trust. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>
*   **Support for Innovation**: Leadership support is vital for successful innovation, and its absence is a significant barrier. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>

### Research Questions
The study aimed to determine:
*   What skills and competencies are needed across senior civil servants to support [[public_sector_innovation_introduction | public sector innovation]] and become stewards of the system? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>
*   What policies, programs, and reforms does this imply? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>
*   How do existing Brazilian public service reforms align with this vision, and what specific recommendations can be made? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>

### Public Leadership for Innovation
There is no simple formula for public leadership for innovation; it is highly contextualized. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a> Leaders must understand their specific situations and apply appropriate leadership tools. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>

#### Six Core Skills Areas for Public Sector Innovation
While not a leadership model, these organizational skills are crucial for civil servants:
1.  **Curiosity**
2.  **User-centricity**
3.  **Iteration**
4.  **Collaboration**
5.  **Sense-making**
6.  **Data use**
Leadership involves ensuring the workforce possesses and can activate these skills. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>

#### Survey Findings
A survey of almost 3,000 Brazilian civil servants revealed:
*   **Self-assessment**: Middle-level confidence in their own skills, strong curiosity, less confidence in iteration or user-centricity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>
*   **Managerial Support**: Significantly lower perception of managers' ability to support skill use. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>
*   **Organizational Readiness**: Perceptions fell between self-assessment and managerial support. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>
Specific gaps were identified in prototyping and the use of behavioral insights. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>

#### Desired Leadership Qualities
Workshops with Brazilian public sector innovators identified three main skill groups for ideal leaders, built on a foundation of public service values and ethics:
1.  **Business Skills**: Aligning resources with needs, various management tools. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>
2.  **Innovation Skills**: Leaders need to understand how innovation processes are supported and led, creating space for professionals to use innovation tools. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>
3.  **Mindsets**: Empathy, empowering civil servants/innovators/citizens, continuous learning, courage, and digital orientation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>

### Senior Civil Service System Model
The report introduces a model for a senior civil service system, thinking in terms of supply and demand:
*   **Supply Side (Building Leaders)**:
    *   Clearly define required skills. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>
    *   Provide opportunities to develop these skills in current and future leaders. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>
    *   Map the workforce to identify existing skills. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>
    *   Create a learning culture for innovation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>
*   **Demand Side (Calling for Leaders)**:
    *   Appoint leaders using defined criteria (e.g., innovation-related). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>
    *   Provide support through training, performance, and accountability mechanisms once leaders are in place. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>

### Main Findings and Recommendations
*   **Supply vs. Demand**: Brazil shows considerable effort in building the supply of leadership skills (e.g., varied innovation training, largely led by Enap), but very little is done on the demand side. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a> The demand side presents a significant political challenge due to appointment processes influenced by the will of the president and ministers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>
*   **Recommendations are phased**: Immediate, second stage, and longer-term, recognizing the need for iterative learning. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>

#### Building the Supply (Immediate to Longer-Term)
*   **Unify initiatives**: Develop a hub (Enap is already doing this) to bring together people working in innovation, map out activities, and include sub-national levels and civil society. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>
*   **Shared Vision**: Use this network to develop a unified "innovative leadership competency model" through a collaborative process. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>
*   **Training Ecosystem**: Increase transparency of training offers, conduct skills analysis, and align training to the competency model. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>

#### Building the Demand (Immediate to Longer-Term)
*   **Merit-based Hiring**: Develop practices that assess innovation competencies at higher levels. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a> A presidential decree establishing minimum criteria for DAS and FCPE positions is a great starting point, but much more is needed for a genuine senior civil service system. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>
*   **Pilot Initiatives**: Enap could pilot new hiring and recruitment approaches. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>
*   **Legislation**: Longer-term, scale up and embed these practices in legislation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>
*   **Job Profiles and Performance**: Innovation must be reflected in job profiles and performance assessments for senior civil servants. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a> This is challenging to measure but crucial to provide clear objectives and mitigate personal risk for innovators who might otherwise face legal troubles for crossing "gray areas." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>

## Q&A and Reflections

### Role of Public Universities
*   **Ecosystem Contribution**: Universities can provide insights into problem identification, generate new solutions (technology, policies, practices), and offer rigor in studying innovation processes and outcomes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>
*   **Talent Pipeline**: Universities are crucial for creating the pipeline of future public sector civil servants and leaders. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a> Stronger linkages between governments and universities are needed to target graduates and clarify opportunities in government. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a> Universities must teach the right skills and present the public sector as a valuable career path. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>
*   **Knowledge Creation**: Universities play a crucial role in innovation policies by promoting connections between government, universities, and the private sector to develop innovation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>
*   **Policy Innovation vs. Innovation Policies**: In [[public_sector_innovation_introduction | public sector innovation]], the focus is often on "how to do things differently in government" (policy innovation) rather than creating totally new knowledge (innovation policies). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a> This overlap means universities should be more fluidly integrated into policies to promote [[public_sector_innovation_introduction | public sector innovation]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>
*   **Piloting Public Policies**: Enap is exploring piloting public policies with universities to make testing and appraisals faster and more efficient, addressing the current cumbersomeness of pilot programs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>

### [[Open Innovation and its Application in the Brazilian Public Sector | Open Innovation]]
*   **Valuable Tool**: [[Open Innovation and its Application in the Brazilian Public Sector | Open innovation]] recognizes that solutions often come from outside government (e.g., from Brazil or global experiences). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>
*   **Context-Dependent Value**: Its value changes based on the questions and context. It is effective when the broad aim is known (allowing others to bring solutions) but less so in anticipatory or adaptive spaces where questions are less clear or require more exploratory work. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>
*   **Brazilian Experimentation**: Brazil is experimenting with [[Open Innovation and its Application in the Brazilian Public Sector | open innovation]], including a challenge platform ("Desafios") where public sector organizations can suggest challenges and offer awards (including money and additional funding) for solutions, answers, or prototypes from external entities (public, society, startups, companies). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a> This promotes tools for organizations to experiment and invest in new engagement methods. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>

The reports have already promoted some change in Brazil, but the impact is expected to be even greater once they are translated and disseminated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a> The process of creating a solid community around [[public_sector_innovation_introduction | public sector innovation]] and sustaining the conversation is ongoing, with challenges including implementing ideas and visions, bringing more people onboard, and aligning efforts for a more effective Brazilian civil service. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>

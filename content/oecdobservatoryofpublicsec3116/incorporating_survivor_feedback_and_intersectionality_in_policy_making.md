Effective public policy, particularly in sensitive areas such as gender-based violence (GBV), requires a deep understanding of the lived experiences of those affected. This necessitates incorporating survivor feedback and adopting an intersectional lens to ensure policies are truly inclusive and responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.

## Importance of Survivor-Centered Approaches
A core principle for governments should be to place the survivor at the center of all responses to violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>. This means actively listening to survivors and using their experiences to gauge the effectiveness of existing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. Professionals, despite their expertise, may not always know what is "best" for survivors, making direct input from those affected crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>. By [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | listening to survivors]], governments can learn directly if their actions are making a positive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

The [[importance_of_cocreation_in_public_policy | co-creation]] of policies and services with survivors helps ensure that support structures are truly accessible and meet their specific needs, avoiding secondary victimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. This perspective highlights the fundamental purpose of government: to serve its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.

### Practical Applications
The Family Justice Center model, which brings together different services under one roof to support survivors, demonstrates this principle effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. In Europe, these centers have utilized focus groups with survivors, which astonishingly revealed areas for improvement even when professionals believed they were "doing the right thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>. This feedback allowed for better adaptation of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.

A crucial lesson learned during the pandemic was the need for flexibility, creativity, and new ways of working in service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>. This includes leveraging technology and new tools to create communication channels with survivors, such as WhatsApp lines or online platforms, to enhance security and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>.

## Intersectionality in Policy Design
GBV policies must account for groups of women who are more likely to be subjected to violence due to their intersecting identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This includes women with disabilities, migrant women, and other vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. An [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | inclusive policymaking]] approach ensures that policies consider factors like age, disability, and migration status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.

### Addressing Diverse Needs
Measures to achieve this include:
*   **Multi-language communication:** Launching public awareness campaigns in multiple languages to reach diverse populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.
*   **Accessible helplines and websites:** Ensuring national websites and helplines for survivors are available in different languages and formats to cater to various needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>.
*   **Targeted messaging:** Identifying specific groups at higher risk of GBV and sending them tailored messages, guidelines, and information through key community actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
*   **Challenging unconscious bias:** Developing projects that [[implementing_behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | leverage behavioral insights]] to work with first responders (police, prosecutors, judiciary) to challenge preconceived ideas about gender and unconscious bias, thereby improving service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.
*   **Broader outreach channels:** Partnering with diverse organizations, like banks or grocery stores, to make GBV prevention information widely available in local communities, especially for those who may not have access to smartphones or traditional support channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>.

### Data and Evaluation
To effectively address these diverse needs, better data collection and analysis are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>. Robust data helps to:
*   Identify where efforts should be focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.
*   Target specific vulnerable groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.
*   Develop efficient and effective measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

It is critical to have reliable data readily available, even in short terms, to base actions upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.

## Cultivating a Whole-of-Society Approach
[[Addressing inequality and inclusion in governance | Addressing inequality and inclusion in governance]] requires that GBV be tackled as a society-wide issue, not solely by gender departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. This requires political will from the highest levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, along with continuous learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. Building strong coordination mechanisms between different services (police, shelters, counseling centers) and across all levels of government (national, local) is fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for governments to plan more strategically and act more proactively on GBV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It emphasized that no single agency can deal with complex issues like GBV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Moving forward, governments must focus on strengthening governance and survivor-centered approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, building on the lessons learned during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The Forum on Government After Shock hosted a session reflecting on what worked, what didn't, and what might be missing in government responses to the COVID-19 crisis, particularly focusing on [[innovation_in_public_service_delivery | innovation]] and [[public_sector_digital_transformation | digital transformation in public services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The session featured Nikolai Astrup, Norway's Minister of Local Government and Modernization, who shared insights into managing a global problem at both national and subnational levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Navigating the Crisis: Key Principles for Government Response

Minister Astrup highlighted several crucial elements for effective government response during a crisis:

### Building Trust and Communication
In Norway, a society with inherently high trust, it was critical to bring people on board and build further trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This trust was essential for the public's willingness to adhere to government advice and restrictions regarding COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Key communication strategies included:
*   **Frequent Press Conferences:** The central government held press conferences multiple times a week when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Targeted Communication:** Press conferences were directed at children, with the Prime Minister and other ministers answering kids' questions digitally, ensuring all parts of the population were reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Public Engagement Platforms:** Utilizing platforms like Facebook for "people's question time," where ministers answered public questions, contributed significantly to building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Transparency:** Being transparent about why measures are implemented, including uncertainties, is crucial for maintaining trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This includes being open about decisions based on scientific advice and instances where that advice is disregarded for broader considerations like the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Reaching Diverse Communities:** Efforts were made to reach immigrant communities who might not follow mainstream Norwegian news by working closely with religious leaders to convey guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Coordination Across Government Levels
Coordination was paramount for a national response, especially in a geographically diverse country like Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Regular Meetings:** Close contact was maintained with county governors and municipalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Meetings involved multiple national ministers to ensure cross-sector coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Unified National Approach with Local Adaptation:** While national guidelines, requirements, and advice were provided, local governments retained the authority and means to adapt measures to their specific situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This adaptability is key to maintaining public trust, as restrictions must align with local circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Collaboration with Health Authorities:** Press conferences and decisions are made in close contact with health professionals, basing decisions on scientific advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Focusing on Vulnerable Groups
A significant concern was safeguarding vulnerable children and ensuring that those struggling before the crisis did not suffer even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This focus also extended to immigrant communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Targeted Support:** Municipalities received financial support, advice, and guidance to follow up with vulnerable groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Specialized Personnel:** It was emphasized that healthcare workers specializing in vulnerable children should not be diverted to tasks like contact tracing, which can be done by non-medical professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## [[digital_transformation_in_government | Digital Transformation in Government]] and [[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | Adaptive Innovation]]

The COVID-19 crisis acted as a catalyst, accelerating many existing trends and innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### Accelerated Digitalization
*   **Online Health Consultations:** Despite long-standing aspirations to promote online health consultations, uptake was low before COVID-19. The pandemic led to an explosion in their use, which is expected to continue post-crisis due to efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   **Addressing Legal Barriers:** The crisis highlighted legal barriers to digitalization, such as requirements for physical meetings or signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This accelerated efforts to review laws and make them technology-neutral, moving towards "AI-ready laws and regulations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. This is seen as the beginning of a larger transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

### Cultivating an Innovation Culture
Minister Astrup identified three key elements for change in society: culture, leadership, and competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   **Culture:** Foster a culture that encourages challenging existing methods, new ideas, and allows for some failure, especially when exploring new ways to deliver services to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Leadership:** Leaders must inspire this culture of [[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
*   **Competence:** Ensure the necessary competence is available to follow through on innovations, especially in smaller municipalities that may lack resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Close cooperation between municipal and national levels is vital to pooling resources for new technology platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

### Seamless Services Across Government Levels
A new white paper on [[innovation_in_public_service_delivery | innovation in the public sector]] was presented to Parliament in June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Furthermore, a new strategy for the [[public_sector_digital_transformation | digitalization of the public sector]] was developed in collaboration with municipalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. The objective is to make services seamless across governmental levels, as citizens care about receiving good quality service with less hassle, regardless of whether it's provided by the state or municipality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

Norway is also prioritizing the digitalization of "life events" â€“ holistic processes that involve multiple actors and levels of government, such as having a child, which can involve over 60 different touchpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

## Maintaining Trust in Government
Norway has maintained a high level of trust in government institutions throughout the crisis, in contrast to declines seen in some other countries after the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.
*   **Accessibility and Openness:** Politicians are highly accessible and engage directly with citizens, breaking down traditional barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. This openness helps build trust, as politicians are not perceived as being in an "ivory tower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.
*   **Trust in Institutions over Individuals:** While politicians come and go, trust in the enduring government institutions is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.
*   **Addressing Inequalities:** A key concern is to avoid exacerbating existing inequalities, which are detrimental to societal well-being and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Government measures aim to provide security for individuals and families, spending significant resources to support businesses and prevent mass unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

## Looking Forward: Safeguarding Innovation and Cooperation
The crisis has forced governments to learn and adapt quickly, fostering a spirit of [[impact_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] that needs to be safeguarded for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

> "We are just at the beginning of learning lessons from COVID-19... it's important that we in the months and years to come really try to understand what this crisis has meant for our societies and how what we need to change in the years to come to make sure that we are better prepared as a society but also that we can make use of the innovations and the new ways of working together to solve the big challenges of our time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>

The crisis has reinforced the understanding that major societal challenges, such as climate change and growing inequalities, require cooperation and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. The sense of being "all in the same boat" fostered by the pandemic might be crucial for addressing other global issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

The purpose of the webinar on anticipatory innovation is to explore how public sector organizations detect, understand, and act upon future changes in their present-day work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This specifically includes the challenge of making the fast-moving [[digital_transformation_and_egovernance | digital transformation]] inclusive and beneficial for societal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Digital Transformation

Digital transformation, like other significant future changes, requires governments to prepare for and shape the future effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This involves making the most of available knowledge about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Organizational Habits and Resistance to Change
A significant challenge in [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | public sector innovation]] and futures practice within a policy context is overcoming ingrained organizational habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. These habits can include:
*   Reliance on policies and precedents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   Adherence to existing rules and routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   Resistance to change because "that's how we've always done it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   Organizational culture that may be risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   Lack of internal capacity or capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

Unless these organizational habits are investigated, thinking about the future and [[public_sector_innovation and digital transformation | innovation]] becomes challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### Embracing Uncertainty and Preparedness
A crucial aspect of preparing for the future, including [[challenges_in_digital_government_transformation | challenges in digital government transformation]], is to ask, "What if we were wrong?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. While this can be a difficult question for large bureaucratic organizations to entertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, events like COVID-19 have demonstrated that disruptions exist and assumptions can be dramatically wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The focus has shifted from convincing people they might be wrong to emphasizing preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

Uncertainty is not inherently negative; it simply means "you don't know," and what follows can be either positive or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. Foresight aims to help steer towards positive outcomes and avoid negative ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

### The Myth of Best Practice
The concept of "best practice" is a myth when looking at the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. The assumption that past methods will continue to work in future contexts is not valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This is particularly relevant for [[challenges_and_strategies_for_digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]] efforts, as rapidly evolving technology makes historical precedents less reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

## Strategies and Opportunities for Digital Transformation

### Strategic Foresight and Anticipatory Innovation
Strategic foresight is central to strengthening and growing democracy, promoting public trust, addressing challenges like climate change, and preparing governments to better serve societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This involves making current decisions to better prepare for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The OECD Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | Public Sector Innovation]] focuses on how strategic foresight and other anticipatory work can impact policy actions taken by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Experimentation and Prototyping
Since the future cannot be known in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, experimentation is a key theme for preparing for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Experimentation, learning, and evidence-gathering are at the heart of public sector innovation today and effective democratic and sustainable public policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

This approach is crucial for [[digital_transformation_of_public_services | digital transformation]], allowing governments to:
*   Design experiments to learn collaboratively with academia and the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   Test, observe, reflect, and iterate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   Develop innovative and value-changing prototypes and experiments to bridge the "impact gap" between foresight work and policy actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Because every policy request or project is new, [[agile_and_digital_transformation_in_government | experimentation]] is a daily reality in foresight work, requiring constant adaptation of standard methods to specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

### Developing Foresight Literacy
A significant challenge in organizations, particularly in institutions like the European Commission, is a lack of foresight literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. This leads to misunderstandings about how to best use foresight, often exacerbated by a strong focus on short-term political pressures and quantitative efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Training colleagues on "what is foresight" and "how best to use it" is seen as a way to increase comfort with uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

### Longer-Term Thinking
Thinking with a longer horizon can change the game for solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. If an organization has a longer runway (e.g., ten years or a generation) to address issues like the education system, the range of policy options available expands completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This long-term perspective is the ultimate goal of futures work, especially when tied to the [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | innovation]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

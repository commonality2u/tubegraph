[[enhancementoriented_innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]] is a frequently observed practice within government when undertaking innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Definition and Purpose
The core of [[enhancementoriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] is to upgrade what already exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It focuses on enhancing current practices and systems that the government has in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This type of innovation aims to make a specific system better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, or to exploit existing ideas to improve what is currently established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Characteristics
[[enhancementoriented_innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]] typically does not involve calling for the transformation of entire systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Instead, these innovations are implemented within existing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Risk Profile
The risks associated with [[enhancementoriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] are relatively low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It is possible to calculate the risks connected to their implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Examples
Common examples of [[enhancementoriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] include efforts to make taxation systems work more efficiently, faster, or quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. When governments use behavioural insights to encourage citizens to pay taxes faster or to respond to queries in a more informed manner, this can be characterized as [[enhancementoriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

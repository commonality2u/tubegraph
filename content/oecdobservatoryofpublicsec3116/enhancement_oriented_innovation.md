[[enhancement_oriented_innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]] focuses on the gradual or incremental improvement of public services, aiming to increase public value without disruptive leaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. It is one of the most widespread and common types of innovation within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) conducts extensive research on various [[types_of_innovation_missionoriented_enhancement_adaptive_anticipatory | types of innovation]], with [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] being a key area of focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Core Principles and Characteristics

[[enhancement_oriented_innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]] typically involves:
*   **Upgrading Practices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
*   **Achieving Efficiencies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
*   **Building on Existing Structures** rather than radically challenging the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>
*   **Providing Value for Money** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>
*   **Improving Productivity** and effectiveness in daily operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>

While starting as incremental improvements, these innovations can lead to significant shifts in public services, particularly through digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. In fact, many digital transformation projects in the public sector are fundamentally based on [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. It often focuses on areas of certainty, providing a clearer return on investment compared to riskier innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

> "In reality all innovations that have been actually successful, all developments of public services in the public sector in terms of innovation portfolios end up at some point in enhancement oriented innovation activity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>

## Relationship with Public Sector Productivity

[[enhancement_oriented_innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]] is closely linked to public sector productivity, which measures total outputs divided by total inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This focus helps agencies achieve improvements in their core services over the long term (5-10 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

Key drivers of productivity change in the public sector include:
*   **Specialization** and increasing professionalization of roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>
*   **Increasing Capital Intensity**, driven by digitalization and robotic process automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>
*   **Embodied Technological Change**, where external technology influences public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>

The realization of productivity gains depends on the society's and clients' ability to adopt new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Measuring public sector productivity involves:
1.  Focusing on core mission outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.
2.  Developing unit cost or activity accounting for outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.
3.  Defining a cost-weighted total output metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
4.  Dividing total outputs by total inputs to get a measure of total factor productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

Unlike efficiency reviews, which are often ad-hoc and aim to cut costs, a productivity focus is continuous and aims to achieve better quality for customers, simpler processes for staff, and cheaper production for the agency simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

## Applications and Examples

[[enhancement_oriented_innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]] manifests in various ways across public services:

## Challenges and Limitations

Despite its importance, [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] faces several challenges:
*   **Mindset Issues**: Resistance to change and narratives like "we've always done it this way" can hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:10">[01:46:10]</a>.
*   **Subtraction Bias**: Humans tend to add new elements to systems rather than removing or optimizing existing ones, underestimating the power of subtracting unnecessary processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.
*   **Status Quo Bias**: Once a service is operational, challenging or changing the status quo becomes very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide**: Digitalization efforts must address issues of inclusion to avoid exacerbating existing inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:45">[01:51:45]</a>.
*   **Lack of Resources and Knowledge**: Insufficient resources or a lack of understanding of relevant tools (e.g., behavioral insights) within government can be barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:27">[01:49:27]</a>.
*   **Scaling Up**: Successful experiments or innovations are often not scaled up to a larger population or broader implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.
*   **Transparency of Failure**: A reluctance to share what "didn't work" limits learning and broader progress across the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:23">[01:50:23]</a>.

## Role of Administrative Paradigms

Administrative paradigms, such as classical public administration, New Public Management (NPM), and New Public Governance (NPG), set the context for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a>.
*   **New Public Management** often emphasizes cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and performance improvement, focusing on clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.
*   **New Public Governance** shifts focus to quality improvement, co-creation of solutions with communities, and collaborations through networks and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

These paradigms influence the types of [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] pursued, with NPG promoting more collaborative and citizen-involved approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. Small, incremental steps, common in public sector innovation, can collectively lead to gradual transformation and institutional change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.

## Future Outlook

While anticipation and [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] may capture headlines, [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] remains the area where public sector innovators spend the most time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:50">[01:56:50]</a>. It is crucial for driving productivity and effectiveness in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:24">[01:57:24]</a>. The level of ambition in enhancing broader systems can lead to substantial gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:15">[01:57:15]</a>.

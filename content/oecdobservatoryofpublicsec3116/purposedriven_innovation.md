[[mission_oriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is a type of innovation defined by a clear purpose for why innovation is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This approach focuses on solving a specific challenge or problem within society that necessitates innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It is fundamentally about purpose-driven innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, with clear goals outlining the reasons for innovating in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Characteristics

*   **Clear Purpose**: Innovation is driven by a defined goal or problem to be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   **Goal-Oriented**: There is a specific target to achieve, acting as a clear metric of success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **System Alignment**: Entire systems or organizations are structured to fulfill the stated mission or goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Idea Generation**: The pursuit of the main goal can lead to the emergence of many new ideas that might be beneficial in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Example: The Moonshot

One of the most widely recognized examples of [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] is the moonshot, aiming to reach the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The objective was unambiguous: either the moon was reached or it wasn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Everything within NASA was meticulously arranged to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

This singular focus resulted in:
*   Direct innovation stemming from the moonshot effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   The emergence of numerous diverse innovations as a side effect of the [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has brought a new impetus to [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] practices worldwide, highlighting the need for a fundamental shift in how governments operate. A key reflection emerging from the "Aftershock dialogues" is the profound importance of radical listening in fostering effective governance and lasting transformation [00:00:41].

## The Fallacy of Knowing All Answers
A central challenge revealed by the pandemic is the long-standing issue that governments have not yet learned how to truly listen, or, as some suggest, how to "radically listen" [00:07:43]. Much of the decision-making observed has been based on an outdated idea that governments inherently know what to do, will announce it, and people will simply follow [00:07:54]. This notion of government possessing all the answers has always been a fallacy, and its unraveling is evident [00:08:07].

This problem is exacerbated by a lack of proper listening mechanisms. The immaturity of participative democracy means that spaces for collaboration and discussion are limited, allowing power to be quickly assumed by a few, often leading to flawed assumptions about how people live [00:08:13]. The pandemic has highlighted a lack of understanding regarding the [[Impact of government innovation on citizens | impact on care homes]], loved ones, schools, and people's jobs [00:08:43]. Existing systems often lack empathy and compassion and are not optimized for [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | learning]] [00:08:50].

## Building Trust and Collaboration Through Listening
When listening is effectively implemented, it can foster trust, allow relationships to flourish, and enable positive outcomes even in challenging circumstances [00:09:14]. While there is no "one-size-fits-all" prescription for listening, its enabling allows for significant [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | learning]] that can inform responses to crises and encourage public contribution to future ideas [00:09:28].

Radical listening should become an ingrained part of government's DNA and culture, rather than being treated as a side activity or merely an [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] [00:09:45]. Through this approach, some communities have successfully created spaces to be heard, leading to faster, better feedback loops, even amidst centralized government responses [00:09:50]. This has allowed individuals who previously felt excluded to gain a voice within government [00:10:02]. The consensus is that listening must be for [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | learning]], not for blame, reinforcing the principle that decisions about people should never again be made without people [00:10:28].

## The Evolving Role of Government
Listening offers a different perspective on recovery and rebuilding, moving beyond merely building things or doing more things to being more human [01:11:09]. It involves sharing power, not surrendering it, by enabling spaces for listening, [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | learning]], and collaboration to grow [01:11:11]. This encourages good ideas to emerge from the community, fostering a shared ownership and responsibility for actions, which is a more realistic approach to accountability in complex times where no single person holds all the answers [01:11:27].

A powerful insight shared by a community leader emphasizes the need to "build the road ahead with the same people you kicked out the system," and that "the people in power don't know us, so it's our job to bring them to a place of understanding" [01:11:47]. This highlights the crucial role of bottom-up engagement in shaping government policy.

## Challenges and Opportunities
While the pandemic has spurred an unprecedented global [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | experiment]], and there is a sense of a "new emerging paradigm" in government, the question remains whether these changes will be lasting [00:17:13]. The risk exists that these shifts are merely temporary responses to fear and anxiety, and that fundamental incentive structures within politics and bureaucracy may not have genuinely changed [00:45:30].

However, some argue that the deeply problematic nature of traditional national government operations and the clear failure of "new public management" mean there is no stable status quo to return to [00:47:04]. The crisis has revealed the fragility of systems operating at 100% capacity, emphasizing the importance of functional redundancy [00:17:49].

Factors that could drive lasting change include:
*   **Continued [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | experimentation]] and [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]]**: Especially at the city level, where exciting and diverse approaches are emerging [00:33:10].
*   **Political will and narrative**: Defining success beyond technocratic measures to include social cohesion and inclusion of marginalized communities [00:29:30]. The ability to question absurd modalities, like excessive bureaucratic hurdles, and not revert to them post-crisis, will be a "litmus test" [00:31:13].
*   **Private Sector Engagement**: A more intelligent and responsible private sector, less focused on short-term gains from failed public service models, could contribute positively [00:34:48].
*   **Citizen Activism**: Movements like Black Lives Matter demonstrate a public determination for change and a deeper focus on anti-racism and equality, particularly among younger generations [00:39:53].
*   **Shifting Public Orthodoxy**: The pandemic has challenged long-held orthodoxies around public finance, revealing that artificial constraints on spending often existed [00:54:13]. This realization could lead to public demands for investment in areas previously neglected, forcing governments to confront their strategic choices [00:55:04].
*   **[[utilizing_and_liberating_talent_in_government | Liberating talent]]**: The crisis has highlighted individuals within government with skills in improvisation and problem-solving, often from lower ranks [01:01:02]. A key challenge is to capitalize on these emergent talents moving forward [01:01:30]. Leaders are increasingly being called upon to emphasize "being" over "doing," focusing on values, behaviors, and relationships to inspire and connect with their workforce, especially younger generations [01:04:16].

The current era represents "plastic hours"â€”crucial moments in history when action can lead to significant change [01:16:43]. These moments, often triggered by crises, depend on the alignment of public opinion, political power, and events, as well as social mobilization and leadership [01:17:09]. They are rare and can be wasted if unnoticed or not acted upon [01:17:20].

Rapid technological advancements, alongside global interconnectedness, pose significant challenges and opportunities for governments and regulatory bodies worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has further amplified the need to rethink how governments, particularly in the regulatory domain, operate towards a future-fit public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>.

## Challenges Posed by Technological Change

[[The role of government in technological and nontechnological changes | Technological change]] and [[emerging_technologies_in_governance | innovation]] present incredible opportunities, but also considerable risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:07">[02:55:07]</a>. New technologies can scale very quickly, often before their potential risks or harms are fully understood by governments, leaving regulators on the "back foot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:10">[03:08:10]</a>. This struggle to keep pace is exacerbated when the effects of new technologies extend beyond national jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>.

A significant issue is the "gulf of knowledge" that often exists between regulators and technologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. This gap can lead to regulations that are outdated by the time they are published, hindering [[innovations in regulatory systems | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. Furthermore, regulatory decisions can sometimes inadvertently favor large tech companies over smaller, newer innovators, who may not have the same access to policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Towards [[Agile Regulatory Approaches | Agile Regulatory Governance]]

To address these challenges, there's a growing emphasis on [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile regulatory governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. This approach seeks to:

*   Rethink how governments devise, develop, and implement regulations to create necessary "guardrails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   Guide [[innovations in regulatory systems | technology]] and [[innovations in regulatory systems | innovation]] forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:07">[03:55:07]</a>.

### Key Principles and Recommendations

The OECD's new recommendation on [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile governance]] to harness [[innovations in regulatory systems | innovation]] outlines several key principles:

1.  **Adjust Regulatory Management Tools:** Ensure regulations are fit for the future, incorporating concepts like strategic foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
2.  **Institutional Foundation for Cooperation:** Establish structures that enable collaboration within and across jurisdictions, acknowledging multi-level governance systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Develop Governance Frameworks:** Include horizon scanning, scenario analysis, and monitoring of regulatory implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. This requires [[the_role_of_data_in_regulation | data]] and the capacity to work with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.
4.  **Outcome-Focused Regulation:** Regulations should not be ends in themselves but tools to achieve real-life effects, measured and observed based on clearly defined goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.
5.  **Promote Compliance and Support Innovators:** Regulators should act as "champions for the public" and for [[innovations in regulatory systems | innovation]], helping innovators navigate the regulatory environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. This shifts the mindset from "policemen" to a support function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>.

### International Cooperation

International cooperation is crucial for navigating technological change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>. Sharing knowledge and evidence helps avoid unnecessary divergence in rules that could inhibit cross-border [[innovations in regulatory systems | innovation]] and joint action on common risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.

The **Agile Nations Network**, formed by Denmark, Canada, the UK, UAE, Italy, Singapore, and Japan, fosters international cooperation on rulemaking and practical activities to promote [[innovations in regulatory systems | innovation-friendly]] approaches to [[emerging_technologies_in_governance | emerging technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. Its goals include:

*   Sharing foresight and evidence on opportunities and risks of [[innovations in regulatory systems | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>.
*   Exploring joint experimentation or sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>.
*   Identifying opportunities for interoperable regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>.
*   Supporting startups navigating international regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

## Experimental Lawmaking and Regulatory Sandboxes

[[Anticipatory governance in technology policy | Experimental legal regimes]], while not new (dating back to the 1990s), are becoming increasingly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>. These regimes allow actors to test new technologies or services in a real-life environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>. Key characteristics include:

*   Temporary nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>.
*   Trial-and-error approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:49:00">[25:49:00]</a>.
*   Collaborative involvement of stakeholders, innovators, and competent authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>.

**Regulatory sandboxes** are a sub-category of experimental law that can waive or modify national rules temporarily to promote [[innovations in regulatory systems | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>. The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act proposal, for instance, introduced regulatory sandboxes to foster [[innovations in regulatory systems | innovation]] and reduce regulatory burden for SMEs and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>. These sandboxes provide a controlled environment for development, testing, and validation of [[emerging_technologies_in_governance | innovative AI systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:54]</a>. Data protection authorities are expected to act as "gatekeepers" in these AI regulatory sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>.

From an industry perspective, while sandboxes are useful, a "minimum viable product" (MVP) approach to regulation is proposed. This involves releasing small regulations to the market, observing impacts, and then pivoting based on results. This is seen as more powerful than sandboxing alone, as it captures the interconnectedness of technology in a real environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>.

## Industry Perspective on Agile Regulation

From the business side, crucial elements for effective [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile regulation]] include:

*   **Accountability:** Regulators should be accountable for their decisions and their outcomes, operating more like a startup with clear KPIs linked to taxpayer benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Informed Decision-Making:** Requires deep upskilling of regulators and policymakers in [[emerging_technologies_in_governance | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Policy discussions need to move beyond high-level concepts to the intricacies of technology.
*   **Inclusivity in Consultation:** Policy makers should prioritize engagement with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and new tech startups, as their implementation of technology can differ significantly from larger companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>.
*   **Interconnectivity:** Fostering a global agile ecosystem for [[innovations in regulatory systems | technology]] regulation is critical. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the possibility of global decision-making, which should be applied to technology to mitigate risks for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Regulation

There is a fundamental difference between startups, which might fail, and public service, which requires stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>. The solution lies in accepting experimentation and learning from mistakes within a controlled environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.

The European Commission is also developing its "better regulation" system to be more flexible and agile, with a strong focus on burden reduction through initiatives like the "one in one out" approach (removing an equivalent burden for every new one introduced) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. They aim for better alignment with policy agendas, integrating principles like "digital by default" and linking to sustainable development goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:57">[01:51:57]</a>.

The core idea for future regulation is not to regulate every single [[innovations in regulatory systems | innovation]], but to establish clear guidelines based on a "do no harm" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>. If an [[innovations in regulatory systems | innovation]] conflicts with these general guidelines, then engagement, understanding, and experimentation (including sandboxes) should be pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:51">[01:22:51]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to move towards a future where all regulation is agile, embodying the principles of flexibility, responsiveness, and a deep understanding of [[technological_advancements_in_governance | technological change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This also requires fostering an "administrative entrepreneurial spirit" within public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:47">[01:30:47]</a>.

Governments today operate in an increasingly complex world where problems transcend traditional departmental boundaries and policy fields [00:00:38]. Addressing the [[Future of Government Anticipation and Systems Thinking | future of technology policy]] and other substantive policy areas requires overcoming both mental and physical silos within government structures [00:00:20]. The goal is to foster a more integrated, anticipatory process across all levels of government [00:01:09].

## The Challenge of Silos

The inherent complexity of modern challenges means that issues often "go beyond the normal silos that the governments have actually built" [00:00:48]. This necessitates a discussion on how [[Public sector and technology integration | technology policy]] should interact with other governance institutions, policy areas, missions, and goals within the [[Public sector innovation and government transformation | public sector]] [00:00:55].

A common observation is that [[integrating strategic foresight into government organizations | anticipation]] does not always happen in a systematic manner within governments [00:04:32]. Even when efforts exist, they may be concentrated at the center of government, within individual ministries, or in government think tanks [00:04:09]. A significant finding from audience polling indicates that "institutional structures that actually support participatory innovation" are frequently lacking, highlighting a gap in capabilities for effective [[innovation in government | innovation]] [00:35:58].

Furthermore, there is a tendency for "solutionism," where solutions are taken for granted without asking fundamental questions about desired societal outcomes [00:58:27]. This is exacerbated by governments' preference for quantitative evidence, making it difficult to explore qualitative exercises and discuss complex future scenarios, especially when technology is still in early development phases [01:03:11].

## Strategies for Breaking Silos

### Integrating Anticipatory Processes
The ideal approach involves an "integrated anticipatory process throughout the government itself" [01:01:11]. This means that foresight systems should be well-established and diversified beyond traditional scenario planning, utilizing various tools and facilitation methods [01:14:30]. Technology, science, and innovation elements are crucial for any foresight system, as they are sources of critical uncertainties and systemic interconnections [01:15:18].

Singapore, for example, has a mature foresight system that operates across the entire government, involving central agencies, ministries, think tanks, and higher learning institutes [01:16:40]. However, while foresight is strong in general government policy, formal foresight is less common within dedicated science, technology, and innovation (STI) agencies, which often focus on the "here and now" of research, commercialization, and policy [01:17:01]. Integration efforts, such as those by Singapore's National Research Foundation, aim to connect research, commercialization, and policy, providing regular scans of emerging trends [01:19:42].

### Citizen and Public Engagement
[[Collaborative governance and breaking silos in mission implementation | Citizen engagement]] is a "very useful" tool to "break silos" because citizens often approach issues without the institutional biases of government departments [00:23:39]. They think about future problems and their concerns, forcing government officials to look beyond their own departmental boundaries [00:23:47].

Key aspects of effective public engagement include:
*   **Equipping Citizens with Information:** Providing citizens with necessary data and expert information helps them engage meaningfully, as seen in "citizen jury" formats where initial time is dedicated to learning [01:20:27].
*   **Strategic Questioning:** Asking non-technical, indirect questions, such as "what they're afraid of" or "what kind of aspects...they're looking forward to," can yield rich qualitative data and uncover implicit insights into future trends [01:22:06].
*   **Facilitation and Space Creation:** Creating a structured space for dialogue allows for the exploration of diverse opinions, including minority stances, and helps identify underlying values rather than just individual interests [01:23:36]. This process ensures that discussions focus on fundamental questions about the desired society, rather than solely on technical aspects [01:37:09].
*   **Addressing Power Dynamics:** Involving citizens and other stakeholders in co-creation processes requires critical scrutiny of how power is configured, ensuring that all participants can shape discussions about the future and that their insights lead to concrete policy interventions [00:53:29].

### Experimentation and Co-creation
Concepts like "living labs," "test beds," and "sandboxes" offer designated experimental spaces to test transformative technologies under real-world conditions, ideally with public participation [00:46:26]. Crucially, these spaces often involve a lowering of regulatory burdens to facilitate experimentation [00:47:37].

A key shift in perspective is needed: from testing technologies *in* societies to testing societies *around* new technologies [00:48:25]. This approach takes seriously questions of "what kind of society do we actually want to live in" and whether the public is ready for certain developments [00:48:36].

[[Innovation in government | Co-creation]], while popular, is not a panacea and requires careful deployment [01:26:51]. It encompasses a wide variety of approaches, from hackathons to public procurement processes [01:27:51]. The critical challenge is to continuously scrutinize the co-creation agenda, from design to recruitment, decision-making, funding, and upscaling [01:28:22]. It's also important to acknowledge the limitations of current citizens in defending the interests of future generations, given how rapidly technology evolves [01:26:05].

### Engaging the Private Sector
Given that a significant portion of R&D in OECD countries is conducted by industry, it is crucial to engage the private sector in [[Future of Government Anticipation and Systems Thinking | anticipatory governance]] efforts [01:00:09]. This presents challenges, especially with small startups focused on survival, but also opportunities to align business models with societal values.

Strategies for engagement include:
*   **Clearly Defining Challenges:** Governments can define broad or specific public policy challenges and invite creative solutions from the private sector through open innovation processes [01:37:04].
*   **Promoting Value-Driven Approaches:** Encouraging "social entrepreneurship," "B corporations," and "value-driven corporations" that embed public interest values into their corporate structure and technology design [01:35:28].
*   **Radical Transdisciplinarity:** Integrating diverse expertise, including humanities and social scientists, into technology development to ensure that engineers optimize for goals aligned with societal values, rather than purely technical ones [01:36:33].
*   **Common Language:** Developing a shared language, such as "public value," can encourage startups and the private sector to demonstrate their contribution to public well-being, fostering collaboration and moving beyond a sole focus on profit or "gadgets" [01:40:42].

Ultimately, the aim is to develop the deliberative capacity of various communities to engage in discussions about technology and governance, moving towards a future where technology is designed "in and for society" [01:33:12]. This involves fostering [[international collaboration in government innovation | global technology cooperation]] and ensuring that innovation is both widespread and well-managed [01:17:13].

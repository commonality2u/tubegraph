The public sector operates in an environment of constant change, which necessitates that governments also adapt and evolve what they do. This includes how they approach [[Innovation in public service delivery | innovation]] and react to emergent [[digital disruption in public sector | digital disruption in public sector]] caused by new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Need for [[Adaptive innovation in public services | Adaptive Innovation]]

Governments must consistently and deliberately leverage [[Impact of innovation in the public sector | innovation]] as a resource because they operate in an environment of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. In an evolving economy, governments need to adjust their policy settings and methods to maintain the same level of outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. If a government fails to innovate, it risks always being behind, reacting to issues, and consistently disappointing citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

[[Innovation and digital transformation in public services | Innovation]] needs to be a core competency within the public sector, considered as one of the essential options for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This means [[Innovation and digital transformation in public services | innovation]] should be a repeatable, consistent, and systemic activity, rather than an ad-hoc or reactive one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Challenges with Disruptive Technologies

Historically, public service [[Innovation in public service delivery | innovation]] has often been reactive or opportunistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This is problematic because feedback loops within the public sector tend to favour investing in clearly understood options rather than emergent ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

When demand shifts, or new technologies emerge, governments must be ready to respond immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. This requires early investment and exploration, even before there is clearly articulated demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. If governments wait until something is fully understood, they become "takers" rather than "shapers" of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. The inability to become a sophisticated consumer of new technologies or engage effectively with [[Innovation and digital transformation in public services | innovation]] reduces a government's absorptive capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

Governments must proactively invest in and support the technology infrastructure, systems, and capabilities that match their evolving context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. The risks of allowing disruptive technologies to develop without intervention are becoming increasingly clear, as seen with social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>.

## Government's Role in Responding to Disruptive Change

The issue of disruptive technology will be a major driver of work within the public service for the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. The question is not *whether* governments will learn to adopt and apply these technologies, but *when* and *how quickly* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.

Currently, the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector [[Innovation in public service delivery | Innovation]] (OPSI) is exploring what an "anticipatory [[Impact of innovation in the public sector | innovation]] government system" looks like. This involves governments being open to emergent disruptive shifts, engaging with them, and actively shaping how new technologies develop, rather than simply waiting and reacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>.

Agencies that excel in this area are typically those where the costs of being surprised are well understood, such as in defense, medicine, animal health, and crop production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.

### Canadian Context and Initiatives
In Canada, a Deputy Minister Task Force on public sector [[Impact of innovation in the public sector | innovation]] has been mandated to explore two key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>:
1.  **Core systems transformation:** Looking at areas like grants, contributions, human resources, and procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.
2.  **Experimenting with disruptive technologies:** Such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, to learn lessons on how to adapt and adopt these technologies into government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>.

The goal is to become smarter, more risk-savvy, and more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>. Specific examples in Canada include:
*   **Digital Identity:** Experimenting with blockchain technology for digital identity management to improve how citizens interact with the federal government through a single, secure, and user-friendly digital identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>.
*   **Translation Services:** Exploring how AI could make translation services between English and French more effective and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>.

These initiatives emphasize an agile approach: small-scale testing, learning, communicating about findings, and iteratively redoing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>.

## Foundational Elements for Digital Transformation

For effective utilization of disruptive technologies, key foundational pieces must be in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>. One of the most critical is how data is collected and used within the federal architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>. The Government of Canada has recently released a data strategy to address this foundational element, enabling a more informed approach to using disruptive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.

The FPT Declaration on Public Sector [[Impact of innovation in the public sector | Innovation]], published in November 2016, also provides broad coverage and implicit approval for public servants to explore and implement things differently, thereby reducing perceived risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>.

Ultimately, governments need to understand that the "risk" associated with [[Innovation in public service delivery | innovation]] and disruptive technologies must be balanced with the tangible risks of *not* innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>. By setting expectations for experimentation, as Canada has done, some of that perceived risk for individuals can be mitigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) introduced the Innovation Incubator, an initiative designed to foster cross-border collaboration and address shared challenges in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Bruno Mon, a Policy Analyst at OPSI, highlights the importance of real government teams collaborating across borders to develop this program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## The Innovation Incubator: An Experimental Approach

The journey of [[public sector innovation]] is neither always "flashy" nor "flawless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This understanding led to an experimental approach with the Innovation Incubator, creating a safe space for exchanging ideas and learning in a protected environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:16">[02:14:16]</a>. The incubation process itself is an experimental initiative, initially without total certainty of its success, but the global community's reaction proved its potential for participating countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

The first edition of the Innovation Incubator aims to:
*   Bring value to projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:14">[03:13:14]</a>.
*   Set up a safe space for teams to work across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:19">[03:17:19]</a>.
*   Provide an opportunity for collective learning and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

### Key Learnings from Global Exploration
A global exploration of existing incubators and accelerators for the public sector identified specificities of public sector innovation compared to the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Two major takeaways from 88 case studies were:
1.  **International borders hinder collaboration:** Despite globalization, international borders still impede collaboration between governments, a area where other sectors have been more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:17">[04:17:17]</a>.
2.  **Need for shared platforms:** There is a well-identified need to strengthen cross-border collaboration through shared platforms, as many challenges are transversal or very similar across different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

These insights led to the development of a government-to-government [[public sector innovation]] incubator model, which focuses on transforming "blind spots" (where borders impair collaboration) into "sweet spots" by making this obstacle the center of the incubator's focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This model promotes cross-border collaboration among governments sharing similar [[innovation in the public sector]] challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:47">[05:47:47]</a>.

### Program Value Proposition
The Innovation Incubator program offers:
*   **Peer learning process:** Facilitating direct knowledge exchange between government teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
*   **Expert insights:** Bringing experts on board to nurture the process with their knowledge and learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
*   **Recognition and visibility:** Acknowledging the efforts of government teams in producing successful, impactful, and value-creating initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term support:** Building close relationships and trust between teams, moving beyond one-off events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

The process, which began in December 2023, utilizes iterative loops to generate knowledge and continuously improve the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Solutions in the Innovation Incubator

The program initiated a call for challenges, receiving 72 submissions from 25 countries across all continents except Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. These challenges often represent the cutting edge of what [[public_sector_innovation]] teams are striving to accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. Following this, a call for solutions gathered 26 submissions from 18 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. The high quality of submissions led to the selection of eight solution providers instead of the initially planned four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

## Advisory Board and Cohort-Based Learning Track

### The Advisory Board
The OPSI Secretariat is supported by an Advisory Board of international experts from the [[public sector innovation]] ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:51:00">[55:51:00]</a>. Their role is to enlarge perspectives, challenge with provocative questions, and share experiences and references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:01:00">[56:01:00]</a>.

*   **Tanya Filer (Public Purpose Technology Intelligence)**
    Filer highlights the value of the program in tackling barriers to [[innovation in the public sector]] and collaboration, scaling the impact of innovations and their underlying ideas, and diversifying [[innovation in public services]] to fit different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:31:00">[57:31:00]</a>.
*   **Lara Salinas (Design Researcher and Educator, Service Futures Lab)**
    Salinas emphasizes the program's role in creating a "safer space for [[innovation in public sector management]]" where learning from "failing and failure" is seen as essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. The "go to go" program enables cross-border government collaboration by matching problem owners with those who have firsthand experience in successfully tackling similar issues, creating a safe space for learning and [[public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
*   **Andrea Ray (European Commission)**
    Ray acknowledges the program as a significant step in OPSI's maturity, supporting multi-country collaborations on tough government challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>. She notes that while public service is good at conceptualizing solutions, it often struggles with embedding and scaling new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>. The program provides a platform to learn how to make "radical solutions stick beyond the incremental" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>.

### Cohort-Based Learning Track
Due to high demand and quality applications, a parallel cohort-based learning track was created, offering 30 government teams worldwide an opportunity to collaborate on specific [[public sector innovation]] challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. This track involves five thematic sessions covering open experimentation, cultural transformation, citizen involvement, evidence-based policymaking, and scaling public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>.

*   **Eva Brožová (Technology Agency of the Czech Republic)**
    Brožová values the opportunity to receive insights from OPSI experts and international peers facing similar challenges, aiming to learn best practices and receive constructive criticism to avoid "blind alleys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. Their challenge focuses on enhancing support for applied research and development to maximize its impact on policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>.
*   **Alexandra Orozco (N_Digitales Perú)**
    Orozco's initiative empowers girls by developing digital skills through [[types of innovation within public sector organizations]] in public schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>. The cohort track is seen as an inspiring opportunity to address the main challenge of scalability across diverse public educational landscapes and to overcome historical access limitations, contributing to closing the gender gap in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.

## Conclusion
The Innovation Incubator marks the opening of a new phase, testing its model and methodology for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>. It serves as a "critical friend," a safe space for learning and exchange, and a platform to try out initiatives without guaranteed success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. The program, enabled by the European Commission's Horizon Europe program, aims to demonstrate the importance and possibility of cross-border collaboration to deliver value and create impact in [[innovation in public services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

The current global landscape is characterized by increasing complexity, where problems transcend traditional governmental silos [00:00:38]. Effective [[anticipatory innovation and engaging with the future | anticipatory innovation]] requires breaking down both mental and physical barriers within governments and individual thought processes, especially concerning the future of [[technology foresight and governance | technology policy]] and various substantive policy fields [00:00:20]. The goal is to achieve a more integrated [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | anticipatory process]] throughout government, ensuring [[Emerging technologies in civic engagement | technology policy]] interacts effectively with other public sector governance institutions, policy areas, missions, and goals [00:00:57].

## The Need for Anticipatory Governance

Creating the conditions for the development and diffusion of trusted and trustworthy technology requires a shift towards [[anticipatory governance in government and technology | anticipatory governance]] [01:08:14]. This is essential due to several factors related to emerging technologies:
*   **Rapid Evolution and Unclear Impacts** [01:08:31]
*   **Misfits with Existing Regulations** [01:08:38]
*   **Deep Social Disruption** caused by uniquely disruptive technologies, such as Uber [01:08:50]
*   **Broad Enabling Capacity** of platform technologies like Industry 4.0 or the next production revolution, each having potential consequences [01:09:00]

This necessity for [[anticipatory governance in government and technology | anticipatory approaches]] is further underscored by the "Coleridge dilemma" [01:09:31]:
*   **Regulating early:** Risks misguided, inadequate, or unnecessary regulation that could constrain innovation, as the full consequences might not be apparent [01:09:35].
*   **Regulating late:** Changing course becomes expensive and difficult once technology is built into infrastructure ("code is law") [01:09:53]. End-of-pipe solutions might be too late [01:10:07].

> [!info] Definition: Anticipatory Governance
> [[Anticipatory governance in government and technology | Anticipation]], as a metaphor, acknowledges that prediction is impossible [01:13:34]. Instead, it aims to anticipate possible plural futures to shape engagement with the innovation process [01:13:42]. This approach helps respond to public concerns, enhance resilience, and mitigate potential public backlash and stranded investment for industries [01:13:54].

The OECD has articulated design principles for [[Technology foresight and governance | upstream governance]] within the innovation process [01:10:47]:
*   **Anticipation:** To address deep uncertainties brought by emerging technologies [01:11:12].
*   **Inclusion:** Ensuring involvement not only in terms of access to technology but also in its production and deliberation [01:11:28].
*   **Directionality:** Focusing on goals and missions, such as [[impact of mission oriented innovation on society | mission-oriented innovation]] [01:11:47].

These principles — covering the *when* (anticipation), *who* (inclusion), and *what/why* (directionality) — should engage the governance and innovation process at various stages, from basic research to applied and downstream phases [01:11:59].

## Current State and Challenges

Surveys indicate that while some anticipation efforts occur at the center of government or within individual ministries, it often "doesn't happen in a systematic manner at all" [00:04:12]. Many organizations are strong in data measurement and sense-making, but challenges exist in institutional structures supporting [[anticipatory innovation and engaging with the future | anticipatory innovation]], learning, evidence, and evaluation [00:07:06]. Vested interests and cognitive biases are also noted as potential barriers [00:08:28].

A key challenge is the perception that innovation in government is easier to implement than anticipation [00:41:52]. [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | Strategic foresight]] and discussions about futures are seen as debatable and raising "hard questions," whereas innovation can be "gotten done and implemented" more easily [00:41:59]. This raises concerns about the considerations used to design innovations if discussions only begin after solutions have been adopted, as seen with private sector platforms and new technologies [00:42:13].

> [!quote] Coleridge Dilemma in Practice
> In early development phases of technology, it's difficult to predict which solutions will scale, yet there's more control over ethical issues and technology design [01:02:23]. However, once more knowledge and evidence are available in later stages, it becomes very difficult to "put the cat back inside the bag," especially with widely adopted solutions like Airbnb [01:02:53]. Governments often prefer quantitative evidence, making it harder to explore topics based on qualitative exercises [01:03:15].

## Strategies and Tools for Managing Emerging Technologies

### Experimentation and Living Labs
The concept of "living labs" (also known as test beds or real-world laboratories and sandboxes) involves designated experimental spaces to test transformative technologies under real-world conditions, ideally with public participation [00:47:00]. These spaces often come with a lowering of regulatory burdens [00:47:37].

The focus is shifting from merely testing technologies *in* societies to testing societies *around* certain new technologies [00:48:25]. This approach actively invites reflection on what kind of society is desired, what happens when new ways of living are tested, and how to address risks like test populations or regulatory loopholes [00:48:36].

Rethinking living labs as governance tools could involve:
*   **Co-developing technology and regulation in tandem**, rather than technology first [00:49:46].
*   Aiming for "better regulation" rather than just "lower regulation" [00:49:58].
*   Viewing them as genuine tests, not just demonstrators of possibility, with mechanisms to roll back if undesirable outcomes emerge [00:50:21].

### [[Anticipatory innovation and engaging with the future | Co-creation]] and Public Engagement
[[Anticipatory innovation and engaging with the future | Co-creation]] involves bringing different innovation actors together for joint activities [00:53:07]. This can take many forms, including public procurement of innovation (governments procuring uninvented solutions), co-creation facilities (often at university-industry intersections), and living labs [00:51:40].

Insights into [[Anticipatory innovation and engaging with the future | co-creation]]:
*   **Diversity of approaches:** [[Anticipatory innovation and engaging with the future | Co-creation]] comes in many forms, with actors having different visions for what they want from it [00:53:39].
*   **Power dynamics:** [[Anticipatory innovation and engaging with the future | Co-creation]] can frame situations in ways that grant power to some, making it crucial to ask "who actually gets to shape discussions about the future" [00:53:23].
*   **Scaling challenges:** Scaling up [[Anticipatory innovation and engaging with the future | co-creation]] can lead to a loss of local specificity, which is often its core value proposition [00:54:23].
*   **Sustainability:** [[Anticipatory innovation and engaging with the future | Co-creation]] communities are difficult to maintain, as efforts are often tied to project funding rather than institutionalized long-term visions [01:29:32].

Citizen participation is critical for breaking silos, as citizens tend to think about future problems rather than ministerial boundaries [00:39:00]. Strategies for effective citizen engagement include:
*   **Equipping citizens with data and information:** Deliberative processes often dedicate significant time to learning from experts [01:20:25].
*   **Careful facilitation:** Designing processes to elicit meaningful insights, sometimes using "oblique questions" (e.g., asking about fears or hopes for the future) rather than direct technical queries [01:21:26].
*   **Recording broadness of opinions:** Not just averaging out individual opinions, but recognizing that minority stances can point to future trends, fears, or hopes [01:23:48].
*   **Creating inclusive spaces:** Ensuring diverse groups, including those with less formal education or dissenting views, have a chance to enter the debate and find common ground on underlying values [01:24:40].
*   **Developing deliberative capacity:** The ultimate goal is to build the capacity of various communities to engage constructively in discussions, which requires mediated expertise, journalism, multi-disciplinary education, and other supporting elements [01:33:09].

### Defining Clear Challenges
Governments can define challenges clearly to invite creative solutions, as seen with hackathons for public policy purposes or national innovation challenges (e.g., in Estonia and Singapore) [01:37:10]. Setting clear bounds helps focus energies on specific problems with public policy significance [01:37:51].

### [[Technology foresight and governance | Upstream Governance]] and Standards
Voluntary design standards are gaining prominence as a mode of global governance [01:14:25]. They are seen as market-friendly, globally reachable, and capable of addressing complex governance challenges across levels and sectors [01:14:30]. However, standards are not neutral; they "create facts and embody values" and should therefore be subject to democratic inclusion [01:14:42]. Concepts like "safe by design" and "ethics by design" are examples of [[Technology foresight and governance | upstream governance]] where communities and publics help embed values into technology development [01:15:05].

### Focus on [[Impact of mission oriented innovation on society | Public Value]]
A common language emphasizing "public value" can be a key driver for engaging the private sector [01:40:42]. Startups and private industries are increasingly interested in demonstrating their contribution to public value, especially when public sector funding is involved [01:40:51]. This includes ensuring new technologies like AI are meaningful and do not destroy democracy [01:41:11].

## Roles of Different Actors

### Government
*   **Center of Government:** Plays a role in [[anticipatory governance in government and technology | anticipatory innovation governance]] [00:04:09].
*   **Individual Ministries:** Can also excel in anticipatory activity, e.g., Ministries of Environment or Science [00:04:15].
*   **Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI):** Leads work on [[anticipatory innovation and engaging with the future | anticipatory innovation governance]], focusing on practical implementation [00:01:22].
*   **Singaporean Government:** Has a well-established foresight system since the late 1980s, diversifying its toolkit with methods like Emerging Strategic Issues and Causal Layered Analysis [00:14:30]. Foresight work analyzes how science, technology, and innovation (STI) interact with other trends (politics, society, economy) [00:15:50]. This process happens across the entire government, including ministries and think tanks [00:16:40].
*   **Netherlands (Rathenau Institute):** Founded 35 years ago, inspired by the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment [00:26:36]. Its mandate is to identify political and societal deliberation questions arising from new scientific and technological developments, ensuring a long-term view of their impact on society [00:27:17]. They work for parliament, maintaining political neutrality by presenting diverse visions and clarifying underlying values [00:28:57]. An example is a standing parliamentary committee on the future of digital society, which can look further ahead than current ministerial concerns [00:30:52].
*   **National Research Foundation (Singapore):** Draws together different aspects of STI to ensure coherent work, partnering with the Prime Minister's Office to integrate research, commercialization, and policy [01:39:40]. They actively scan and sense-make trends [01:39:50].
*   **Finland:** Has over 20 years of experience with future committees in parliament, working on [[Technology foresight and governance | technology assessment]] [00:43:53].

### Private Sector
The private sector conducts 70% of R&D in OECD countries [01:00:07] and plays a significant role in taking technology designs into practice and scaling solutions [01:31:52]. However, unlike the public sector, it often lacks formal requirements for integrating ethical considerations into services [01:32:37].

Integrating the private sector into [[anticipatory governance in government and technology | anticipatory governance]] efforts is crucial:
*   **Harnessing their foresight:** Private sector entities are inherently in the business of anticipating future trends [01:34:01].
*   **Addressing engagement barriers:** Small companies, especially startups, may lack the time or interest to engage in ethical or foresight discussions due to survival pressures [01:35:00].
*   **Promoting value-driven approaches:** Trends like social entrepreneurship and B-corporations demonstrate a growing embrace of values in corporate structures [01:35:28].
*   **Radical transdisciplinarity:** Integrating humanities and social science insights to articulate value-driven goals that engineers can then optimize for [01:35:53].
*   **Targeting startups:** Finding systematic ways for startups to incorporate social dimensions of scalability and [[anticipatory innovation and engaging with the future | anticipatory innovation]] into their business models and technology designs from the outset [01:38:46].

### Academic and Research Institutions
These bodies play a role in developing methodologies for foresight and understanding how technology affects society [00:45:28]. Challenges include the research community's traditional focus on hindsight and experimentation rather than future analysis [01:17:56], and the need to prepare future generations (engineers, policymakers) for deploying [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | co-creation]] and [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | anticipatory innovation]] routinely [01:55:21].

### International Organizations
The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the Working Party on Bio-, Nano- and Converging Technologies are actively working to connect communities involved in governmental foresight and technology assessment [01:05:58]. They are developing frameworks for [[Technology foresight and governance | upstream governance]] and exploring ways to mobilize the private sector as a partner in [[anticipatory governance in government and technology | anticipatory governance]] [01:00:26]. An upcoming OECD meeting, "Technology in and for Society: Innovating well for inclusive transitions," will address people-centered technology, foresight, inclusive technology development, global cooperation, and private sector engagement in responsible innovation [01:15:40].

[[innovation_in_government | Innovation in government]], particularly anticipatory innovation, focuses on engaging with the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This area of [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] is highly uncertain, as the future is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Why Anticipatory Innovation is Crucial for Governments

[[reasons_for_government_innovation | Governments]] need to engage with concepts that are not yet reality because once [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] occurs and dominant designs become established, it becomes very challenging to alter them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

For example, the decision regarding which side of the road vehicles drive on was once an [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Once this decision was made, numerous mobility systems became "locked," influencing how cars are driven and how infrastructure is developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. These deeply ingrained practices from the past continue to influence current choices regarding new technological and non-technological [[innovation_in_government | innovations]] and dominant designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Strategies for Forward-Thinking Governments

[[Governments Role in Promoting Innovation | Governments]] must strive to be "a little ahead of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. While it's not always possible to know exactly what will happen, it is vital to analyze and consider a variety of possible future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This proactive approach allows [[role_of_governments_in_fostering_innovation | governments]] to potentially influence emerging dominant designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

For instance, a major concern today is Artificial Intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Anticipatory [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] is necessary to develop appropriate technological and ethical solutions for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This means anticipating different types of solutions and actively shaping their emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Questions like ethical boundaries for AI or the adoption of blockchain solutions can be influenced now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

However, such influence will likely become impossible in ten or fifteen years, when AI is a widespread reality or a large proportion of the population uses blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. To remain ahead and ensure the best outcomes for their citizens and countries, [[role_of_governments_in_fostering_innovation | governments]] must anticipate future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

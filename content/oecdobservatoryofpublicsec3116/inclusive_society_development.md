Building [[engagement_with_civil_society | inclusive societies]] is a key focus, particularly through co-creation with stakeholders to develop policies, services, and ultimately, better futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This approach aims for more robust solutions and greater support for decisions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Defining Co-Creation

For the purpose of this discussion, co-creation is defined as:
> "Involving stakeholders in identifying all dimensions of the problem issue and designing and implementing solutions through a generative exchange of insights and ideas." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>

This involves co-designing policies, co-constructing services, and co-experiencing and improving what has been co-created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Co-Creation vs. Consultation

Co-creation differs significantly from traditional methods like simply informing or consulting:
*   **Informing** may involve merely announcing a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Consultative practices** often involve gathering input, such as through online surveys for comments on draft policies, which can result in a series of controversial "monologues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Co-creation**, in contrast, involves a "generative exchange" where people gather to discuss, refine, and align ideas for a shared path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Benefits of Co-Creation

Engaging in co-creation leads to several benefits:
*   **More Robust Solutions**: Solutions are stronger when developed with diverse input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Increased Support for Decisions**: Decisions gain more buy-in and acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, preventing later obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>.
*   **Learning Experience**: Both participants and administrators gain tremendous learning experiences, sometimes learning more in a day than in a year of study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.
*   **Optimal Results and Proper Decisions**: Co-creation is a strong technique for achieving the best outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
*   **Protection Against Lobbyists**: An open process ensures transparency, making it difficult for secret deals or undue influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.

## Challenges and Pitfalls

Several factors can hinder or compromise co-creation processes:
*   **Hierarchical Mindset**: This is identified as a primary barrier for governments to engage more stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.
*   **Lack of Participatory Knowledge, Skills, and Tools**: Public administration often lacks the necessary expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.
*   **Time Consumption**: While initially perceived as time-consuming, it leads to more effective implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Transparency**: If there's no clarity about what will happen to the results, trust can be compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.
*   **Rigid Regulatory Frameworks**: Inflexible legislation, austerity measures, or procurement procedures can impede experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.
*   **Incumbent Bias / Interpretation**: Bureaucrats should not interpret or translate inputs, but rather listen directly to ensure clarity and maintain trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.
*   **Central Authority Limitations**: No central authority can fully understand or control a complex system, making reliance on co-creation an informational necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Recruiting Diverse Participants**: Ensuring representation from all demographic profiles can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

## Success Factors and Preconditions

For co-creation to be successful, several conditions and attributes are crucial:

### Mindset and Leadership
*   **Political Backing and Momentum**: Clear political support for the process is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.
*   **Clear Purpose**: Define the problem to be solved, allowing participants to help arrive at the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
*   **Openness and Willingness to Change**: Be open to new ideas, views, and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.
*   **Trust and Authenticity**: Be authentic, meaning what you say and saying what you mean, respecting the process fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **Strategic Intent for Change**: An awareness of the limits of conventional policy-making and a strategic intent for change within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.
*   **Institutional Strategic Buy-in**: Senior leadership (directors general, politicians) must understand and commit to why co-creation is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.
*   **Theory of Care**: Institutions need to be designed to care, be open to open-ended questions, and recognize the critical role of others in delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.

### Capabilities and Skills
*   **Skilled Facilitation Team**: A high-powered hosting team is needed to manage the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.
*   **Distributed Learning Capacity**: Co-creation builds a learning community where every partner learns, not just exchanges ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.
*   **"Holding Space" Skill**: This is a fundamentally different capability than control-oriented project management, requiring high emotional intelligence and social presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. Recruitment, rather than just training, can address this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **Project Management Skills**: Staff should be skilled in project management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.
*   **Regular Training**: Organizations should provide systematic training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. The European Commission, for example, has trained over 3,000 officials in participatory methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.
*   **Autonomy and Discretion**: Staff need a high degree of freedom to act and be willing to give discretion to external stakeholders and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.

### Process and Structure
*   **Engagement Across All Policy Phases**: Participation fits well in all phases of the policy cycle, particularly problem definition and solution design, but also implementation and evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.
*   **Challenge-Based System Approach**: Problems have no institutional boundaries, and success can come from a systemic view with participation and co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.
*   **Clear Project Ownership/Sponsorship**: The project sponsor must be committed, have the mandate, and be involved throughout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. Best results are achieved when the sponsor is from state administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.
*   **Concrete Commitments and Communication**: Adopt clear commitments with defined taskholders and deadlines. Regular, two-way communication about progress maintains trust and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.
*   **Openness and Transparency**: Work "out loud" through open documentation of processes, learnings, and reflections to allow for public challenge and input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.
*   **Addressing Complexity**: Co-creation is the only way to deal with complexity, as central control is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.
*   **Legitimacy Construction**: When deviating from traditional policymaking, ensure the process is legitimate, ethical, and transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. Tight scripting can manage the "soft power" unleashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
*   **Active Participation in International Initiatives**: Involvement in international projects related to co-creation can have spillover effects on national and organizational levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.
*   **Absence of Silos**: A lack or absence of silos within the organization is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.

## Examples from the Field

### Circular Plastics Alliance (European Commission)
This initiative aimed to keep waste plastic out of landfills, with a target of recycling 10 million tons of used plastic into new products annually by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Complex Problem**: It required working with all aspects of the system, including chemical producers, product designers, consumers, waste collectors, recyclers, re-users, public authorities, unions, and standardization bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Co-creation Approach**: Instead of legislating, the European Commission proposed creating an alliance, starting with a declaration and inviting value chain members to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Process**: CEOs of main industry and consumer groups came together, followed by 14 fully participatory working group meetings in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This led to a declaration with 120 signatories by September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Methodology**: Meetings were designed individually from the ground up, using classic participatory techniques like World Cafe, Open Space Technology, and Circle Practice. Everything was scripted to the minute, allowing participants complete freedom in discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Key**: Building trust and fostering "generative exchange" to grind opinions against each other, leading to shared solutions rather than competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Online Adaptation**: Moving online during COVID-19 was straightforward due to pre-existing trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. While informal conversations were lost, online processes enabled broader reach, involving people who couldn't travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

### Innovative.si (Slovenia)
This project focuses on creatively resolving complex social challenges and providing knowledge and employee competences for a different way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. It aims to strengthen [[innovation as a response to societal challenges | innovation culture]] in public administration, which traditionally favors top-down approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Process**: A core team within the Ministry of Public Administration matches public sector challenges with facilitators to navigate co-creative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Public sector employees are often part of the facilitation team to learn methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
*   **User Involvement**: Active involvement of users in design from the very beginning is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   **Innovation Community Platform**: An optional platform established for networking, learning, support, and transferring good practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. It hosts monthly events and uses methods like workshops and hackathons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. It has grown to over 400 members from public, private, and academic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.
*   **Innovation Ambassadors**: Individuals (currently 70) who play an active role in the community and their own work environment, acting as entry points and promoting co-creative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. They are expected to implement acquired knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
*   **Importance of Support**: Such communities provide essential support and inspiration in traditionally hierarchical environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

### Cogo Digital Toolkit
Developed by an international consortium, this toolkit provides holistic support for public organizations to implement co-creation, primarily at the service level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. It comprises four interconnected tools, ideally used consecutively:
1.  **Core-Ready**: Assesses an organization's readiness for co-creation through a self-evaluation questionnaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. Provides an assessment score and a roadmap with ideas and best practices for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Allows comparison with other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.
2.  **Co-Serve**: Helps determine which public service is most suitable for renewal through co-creation, using a questionnaire to assess service features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Offers a comparative view of results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
3.  **Core-New**: Actively includes service users in the renewal process using user journey mapping. It aims to help users articulate problems and suggest improvements, with interactive data viewing to aid renewal planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
4.  **Co-Master**: Assesses the quality of co-creation during public service renewal, helping identify areas for future improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

### Mind Shift (Sweden, Mental Health)
This community initiative addresses mental health, a complex problem involving multiple actors like schools, offices, homes, and neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.
*   **Multi-Actor Problem**: No single agency could drive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.
*   **Community Building**: The initiative built a community called "Mind Shift," raising awareness of interdependent risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.
*   **Political Role**: Politicians were present, holding space, which required a different compact with the theory of politics, as answers came from the co-creation process, not just politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

### Antwerp Participatory Budgeting
The central municipality of Antwerp allocated 10% of its budget to a participatory process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>.
*   **Addressing Demographic Bias**: Initially, volunteers were from typical well-educated demographics. To ensure true reflection of the municipality's inhabitants, they actively recruited from immigrant communities, less educated citizens, and impoverished citizens by going to places where people congregate, like sports centers and supermarkets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>.

### Bank of England Citizen Involvement
The Bank of England is actively co-creating policy by bringing citizens into the conversation, hinting at increased use of citizen juries and assemblies as [[inclusive and accessible democratic participation | deliberative frameworks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:59">[00:55:59]</a>.

## The Evolving Role of Public Officials

Public officials need to move beyond traditional control-oriented roles:
*   **Host and Provoke**: Beyond just hosting, public officials should provoke and challenge to ensure public interest is considered, even if it diverges from immediate community interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>. This requires different roles for holding space and holding public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.
*   **Working Out Loud**: Emphasize open working, transparent documentation, and sharing learning reflections publicly to allow for challenge and input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.
*   **Accepting Uncertainty**: Recognize that scientific methods hold uncertainty, and public administration needs to embrace this, fostering a "theory of care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.

## Crisis as an Opportunity

Crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic, highlight the need for a different approach to policy-making:
*   **Agility and Iteration**: Current policy-making processes are not fast or agile enough for long emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. Crises necessitate iterative policy-making, where large-scale changes are continuously adapted, even weekly, based on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. This requires a fundamental rewiring of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>.
*   **New Communication with Public**: This iterative approach demands fundamentally different ways of communicating and participating with the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.
*   **Rethinking Legitimacy**: The construction of legitimacy in an iterative policy process shifts from parliament to the process itself, requiring greater integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.
*   **Structural Reboot**: The challenges posed by crises indicate a need for a structural reboot of institutional frameworks to enable effective co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. This includes reforming public budget making, which is often planned years in advance, to allow for agile, flexible, and iterative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.

Orchestrating [[Multistakeholder engagement in innovation ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]] is a complex endeavor that requires significant attention to trust and coordination among diverse participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The concept of "biophony" – a highly orchestrated acoustic arrangement in nature where each creature finds its niche and responds to others to be heard – offers a unique lens through which to view these partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Just as the "simultaneous rich interweaving of sound allows animals to cooperate and respond to threats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, effective [[Ecosystems and multistakeholder collaboration | innovation ecosystems]] rely on diverse actors cooperating and responding to each other.

Innovation is increasingly recognized as being facilitated by the "interweaving of relationships between a diverse set of actors with diverse interests and a wide range of capabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This means a shift from viewing innovation as a linear process to understanding it as an emergent, collaborative system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## The Importance of Orchestration

In [[Ecosystems and multistakeholder collaboration | innovation ecosystems]], a "cacophony of uncoordinated voices must be orchestrated in order to foster harmony and creativity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Governments and agencies need to develop the capacity to "listen and hear what's missing" and to "fill the gaps between ideas and new products or services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The goal is to help various stakeholders "hear each other and the world around them in order to better identify threats and opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, enabling them to recognize complementarities, draw on each other's capabilities, and develop coordinated, creative relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Successful ecosystem initiatives focus on:
*   Balancing flows of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>
*   Aligning incentives towards a [[cocreation with stakeholders | shared purpose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>
*   Encouraging self-regeneration (autopoiesis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>

## Key Criteria for Successful Cooperation

A poll conducted during an OECD webinar revealed that the two most important criteria for successful cooperation between stakeholders in an ecosystem are:
1.  [[Building trust in publicprivate partnerships | Trust between stakeholders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>
2.  A clear [[cocreation with stakeholders | shared purpose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>

### The Role of Trust and Relationships
While a [[cocreation with stakeholders | shared purpose]] is often emphasized, it is crucial to first establish strong relationships among stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. Without new, more equal relationships that shift existing power dynamics, attempts to develop a new purpose may simply lead to a restatement of existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. Therefore, the dynamic between relationships, power, and purpose is critical for developing new systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

Furthermore, the coordinating entity itself plays a vital role in [[Building trust in public institutions | building trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. The team managing the ecosystem must be enthusiastic and willing to try new approaches, especially given initial skepticism from industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. They must emphasize practical aspects, identify realistic gains for all stakeholders, and simplify complex ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. [[Building trust in publicprivate partnerships | Trust in the coordinators]] to deliver on their promises is essential, as stakeholders can quickly lose interest if they perceive no results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

### Establishing a Shared Purpose and Goals
A [[cocreation with stakeholders | shared vision]] is crucial for cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. Beyond abstract concepts, stakeholders require concrete goals and clearly defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. These KPIs should highlight both individual gains for each stakeholder and the collective benefits that the group can achieve, demonstrating that "together they can achieve more than individually" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Understanding the "maturity levels" of stakeholders is also important, as companies at different stages of their life cycles will have varied objectives and priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Tailoring coordination and KPI definition to these varying needs is crucial for effective collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

### [[Role of communication and transparency in building trust | Communication and Outreach]]
Effective [[Role of communication and transparency in building trust | communication]] is vital for engaging wider networks and achieving broader societal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Organizations need to have strong capabilities in communicating widely to inspire and involve stakeholders beyond their immediate network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

## The Nature of Innovation Systems
Innovation is a complex system involving "interactions between heterogeneous actors" that results in emergent behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. These systems have non-linear and unpredictable responses, with their resilience stemming from the diversity of actors and the flows of information and resources between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Instead of focusing solely on innovation metrics or economic growth, orchestrators should consider outcomes based on how ecosystems function, striving for a balance between value extraction and value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Over-focusing on specific outcomes can lead to "ordering" instead of orchestrating, potentially attracting the wrong types or too much of certain inputs, thereby unbalancing the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Intentional Emergence
While systems change can be a long, meandering process, often taking decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>, there is a need to accelerate this process, especially for pressing societal challenges like aging, healthcare, education, and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. This calls for "intentional emergence," a deliberate effort to synchronize, complement, and coordinate multiple commitments from policymakers, investors, companies, and consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. This approach balances purely emergent models (which leave much to chance) with very directive, mission-driven models, particularly when the ultimate "destination" or solution is not yet clearly defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

Governments worldwide face the critical challenge of addressing long-standing inequalities and ensuring inclusive public services, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This requires significant transformation in public administration and policy design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>.

## Current Challenges and Opportunities

Public administration has been weakened over the past two decades due to crises like the financial crisis and COVID-19, with experienced civil servants retiring and limited opportunities for renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Despite this, new funding and technical support are available to boost recovery based on digital transformation, green initiatives, and a more cohesive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This presents a significant opportunity to reshape institutional capacity and manage new financial flows effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

The pandemic has also highlighted the need for governments to operate in a "whole-of-government" and horizontal manner, breaking down traditional silos between programs, budgets, and organizational structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Effective coordination across ministries is crucial for a cohesive response to complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

A key concern is that governments, despite recognizing lessons learned from the crisis, might not take sufficient concrete action to address long-term problems like climate change, tending instead to focus on short-term solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

## Promoting Equality and Inclusiveness

Crisis situations often exacerbate inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. Addressing this requires rethinking public governance tools, especially as future crises, such as those related to climate change, loom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

Key aspects of promoting equality and [[digital_participation_and_inclusiveness | inclusiveness]] include:
*   **Integrating Diverse Perspectives** Countries must systematically gather diverse perspectives in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. For example, the Netherlands has introduced a "generation check" to evaluate the impact of policies across different age groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
*   **Empowering Youth Voices** Young people have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and show increasing dissatisfaction with democratic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. Their input is vital for future governance models, emphasizing flexibility, accommodating minority voices, and considering future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.
*   **Bridging Divides** Governments must be careful not to create a [[digital_participation_and_inclusiveness | digital divide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>, ensuring that geographical location, social belonging, or generational gaps do not hinder access to basic [[inclusive_service_design_in_government | public services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. A "place-based" or bottom-up approach is necessary to manage digital opportunities inclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.
*   **Citizen Involvement** More [[inclusive_policymaking_and_community_engagement | inclusive citizen involvement]] in policymaking is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. Representation of diverse interests can improve trust in government and enhance policy design and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>.

## Enhancing Governance for the Future

To be fit for the future, governments must invest in the foundations of their governing systems, enabling them to act with speed and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.

Key areas for investment and change include:
*   **Investing in Public Sector Workforce** The public sector workforce is a critical asset, especially during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. Leaders must prioritize supporting their workforce in day-to-day operations and recognize their direct interaction with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
*   **Fostering Innovation** Investment in [[innovative_approaches_to_public_governance | innovation]] is crucial for governments to foresee and respond to complex global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis, for instance, accelerated trends in [[digital_transformation_and_inclusion_in_government_services | digital government]] and rapid upskilling of public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Policy Routines** Policy-making and implementation routines must be adaptive, with frequent convening of stakeholders to adjust policies based on the experiences of the workforce, managers, and the public served <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Annual review cycles are often too slow for the pace of modern challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Strengthening International Cooperation** Global challenges do not respect organizational boundaries, necessitating stronger partnerships and cross-border innovation collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. The EU, for example, is exploring horizontal programs to exchange experiences and civil servants to create a common culture of public administration improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.
*   **Building Public Trust** Focusing on citizens, the government workforce, and effective policies can improve [[public_trust_and_governance | public trust]] and strengthen democratic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to transform government action, organization, and operations to avoid returning to old norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. This means shaping a future with equal opportunities for everyone, leveraging [[digital_transformation_and_inclusion_in_government_services | digital transformation]], and addressing major policy challenges like the climate transition for the benefit of all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. This transformation requires leaders to challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of government with courage and tenacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.

In the face of global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, and high inflation, the future appears uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These crises have highlighted the critical role of the public sector as a cornerstone for citizens in difficult situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Finland is leading the charge in developing and implementing [[anticipatory innovation governance]] to build a more resilient public sector and proactively tackle future issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Finland's Context and Commitment
Finland is currently undergoing one of its largest public sector transformations, including the creation of welfare counties, which represents a new level of public governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This transformation, alongside numerous recent crises, necessitates a more proactive approach to governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Finland intends to take concrete steps to shift towards proactive governance at scale, with the first necessary steps planned for the next government term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This journey is viewed as a marathon, not a sprint, aiming for readiness by the end of the 2020s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Collaboration with the international arena, including the OECD and the European Commission, is a strong commitment for Finland in developing its governance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## The [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] Model in Finland
Finland, in cooperation with the OECD and with technical assistance from the European Commission, has worked on improving [[anticipatory_innovation_governance]] within its administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The report launched on this work is a comprehensive demonstration of the important role of anticipation and innovation in addressing complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Core Concepts
[[anticipatory innovation]] involves creating knowledge about the future and making decisions based on that knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. It goes beyond strategic foresight by actively taking action today towards future outlooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. This requires a governance system that supports innovating today for future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. Key elements include:
*   **Agency in Government**: The ability to use various tools and methods to understand the future, explore alternatives, and translate insights into innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
*   **Authorizing Environment**: A feedback system that legitimizes this work, including evaluation of current policies for future readiness, stress testing, and public dialogue about desired futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

### Implementation and Findings
The project conducted an assessment of the Finnish government's [[anticipatory innovation]] capacity, evaluating both the agency of public servants and their authorizing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Despite Finland being an advanced democracy and governance system, areas for improvement were identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Challenges were clustered into organizational, individual, and procedural levels, hindering anticipation and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

Action research and pilots were conducted in areas such as continuous learning, carbon neutrality, child well-being, and dialogues between politicians and administrative staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

Key findings emphasized the need for:
*   Increased capacity for civil servants to reflect on future policy challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>.
*   Long-term planning in democracies through revised policy-making and budgetary processes, and improved dialogue between politicians and the public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

### Integration of [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] Functions
The model proposes integrating [[anticipatory innovation]] functions into existing government operations, rather than rebuilding the entire government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:01">[02:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>. This includes:
*   Strategy planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:18">[02:11:18]</a>.
*   Budgetary decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:18">[02:11:18]</a>.
*   Legislation and legal acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:18">[02:11:18]</a>.
*   Human resource functions, skills, and capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:18">[02:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:31">[02:13:31]</a>.

New government functions were also identified as necessary:
*   **Government Transition Function**: To ensure continuity of complex policies and transfer of knowledge across government terms, especially during elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:52">[02:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:07">[02:18:07]</a>.
*   **Emerging Issues Planning**: To make the analysis of new emerging topics more transparent and assign clear responsibility for them across ministries and organizational forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:19">[02:18:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:24">[02:18:24]</a>.

Specific action points for the Finnish government outlined in the report include:
*   Systemizing the transition process to improve continuity of long-term reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:02">[02:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:07">[02:29:07]</a>.
*   Developing methods to plan responses to emerging issues, ensuring responsibility and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:11">[02:19:11]</a>.
*   Establishing structures for regular collective sense-making, visioning, and exploration of alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:19">[02:19:19]</a>.
*   Testing new approaches to allocate project resources to emerging phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:29">[02:19:29]</a>.
*   Integrating future-oriented data into fiscal planning systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:33">[02:19:33]</a>.
*   Developing regulatory approaches to support experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:51">[02:29:51]</a>.
*   Designing training teams and roles to make anticipation a reality in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   Institutionalizing dialogue and deliberation to build trust between citizens, public officials, and politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>.
*   Connecting [[anticipatory innovation and foresight]] systems with policy-making to ensure a value chain of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:32">[02:30:32]</a>.
*   Tracking and assessing the use of anticipatory approaches to understand what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:55">[02:30:55]</a>.

The Ministry of Finance plays a coordinating role to ensure all these areas are moved forward in a cooperative and holistic manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:22">[02:33:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:07">[02:35:07]</a>.

### Citizen Participation
Involving citizens is a core aspect of Finland's approach to [[anticipatory innovation governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:21">[02:34:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:26">[02:34:26]</a>. Finland is testing national dialogue models to increase citizen involvement in future-oriented issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:36">[02:34:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:43">[02:34:43]</a>. The goal is to gather knowledge from citizens on emerging anticipatory issues and proactively work to make the future better for them, thereby building trust and resilience in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:58">[02:34:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:18">[02:38:18]</a>.

## Relevance for EU Member States and Beyond
[[anticipatory innovation and foresight]] are considered essential elements of public administration, especially as citizens turn to government during times of change and crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. European administrations face increasingly complex policy issues and "super wicked problems" like climate change and "black swan events" like COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Managing this complexity requires effective decision-making and cooperative systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

The European Commission supports member states in adopting [[anticipatory innovation governance]] through technical support instruments, providing financial and intellectual advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Examples include building an innovation lab in Latvia and projects focused on evidence-informed policy-making and strengthening public administration resilience after COVID-19 in multiple member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Future Challenges for Administrations
Five key future challenges for administrations where [[anticipatory innovation]] capacity will be central include:
1.  **Unprecedented Speed of Technological Change**: Requires adapting administrative working and decision-making methods, enabling human-centricity in public services, and rethinking/redesigning administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
2.  **Impact of Demographic Changes and Increasing Skills Shortage**: New skills are necessary to develop solutions for reform implementation and maintain administrative capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
3.  **Increasing Complexity of Managing Policy Issues**: Encouraging a culture of innovation as a central part of public administration functioning at all levels of governance is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
4.  **Impact and Importance of Green Transition**: Administrations need leadership, competence, knowledge, accountability, and transparency to achieve climate neutrality goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
5.  **Increase in Competition for Limited Public Funding**: Requires prioritization, leadership, innovative thinking, and improved financial management through better understanding of future challenges and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

### Building Resilience
The primary challenge for public administrations is building resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Resilience is born from two elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>:
1.  Stable and efficient processes and structures that deliver quality services and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
2.  A capacity for disruption that allows for challenging, innovating, adapting, and ultimately improving public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

[[anticipatory innovation]] capacity and the courage to challenge the status quo are vital opportunities for democratic societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

### International Perspectives
Other countries are also exploring or implementing similar approaches:
*   **Norway**: Sees similarities with Finland and aims to strengthen a Nordic model of [[anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>. Initiatives include the Norwegian defense research establishment's scenarios on information influence on elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>, public sector scenarios for innovation policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>, and using foresight methods for developing future-fit public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. They emphasize starting small with an iterative approach, sharing cases, and developing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>.
*   **Portugal**: Faces similar challenges of uncertainty and limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. A new institution, PlanAPP, at the center of government, focuses on planning, foresight, and public policy monitoring and evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. Portugal also launched the "Ministries of the Future" initiative and the EU foresight network during its 2021 Council Presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. A key goal is to foster a culture that promotes and integrates foresight and innovation into public administration practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.
*   **Netherlands**: Believes the [[anticipatory_innovation_governance_framework]] could fit well, given its open nature and broad policy discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. However, it's not yet applied in a structured way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. Challenges include translating innovations into policy due to risk aversion among public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>. Long-term funding for infrastructure helps keep issues on the agenda, but new policies face difficulties if still in the innovation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.

## Conclusion
The report on [[anticipatory innovation governance framework]] for Finland provides a blueprint for defining a new model of governance that integrates future thinking, foresight, and innovation as a core operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>. Key takeaways emphasize that anticipation is not an extra layer but an essential driver for public sector effectiveness and part of the culture of a modern public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>. It enables governments to remain dynamic, explore possibilities, experiment, and continuously learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>.

This work is critical for building resilience and fostering trust in public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>. The experience gained in Finland will be used to inform upcoming projects in other countries, seeking to connect anticipation to risk management and resilience plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>. [[anticipatory innovation for governments]] are not just "nice to have" but are critical for governments to work and deliver in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>.

Finland is undergoing one of the largest public sector transformations, including the creation of welfare counties, which is a new level of public governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This transformation, coupled with numerous recent crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, and high inflation, has made the future unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite the uncertainties, these challenges have presented a significant opportunity to build a more resilient public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Citizens rely on the public sector as a cornerstone in difficult situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Finland intends to take concrete steps towards proactive governance, with the first necessary steps planned for the next government term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This transformation is viewed as a marathon, not a sprint, with completion hoped for by the end of the 2020s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Finland is committed to collaboration within the international arena, including with the OECD and the European Commission, to develop its governance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Defining [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]]

[[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] (AIG) involves creating knowledge about the future and making decisions based on that knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. It is not merely strategic foresight or futures thinking, but rather the act of taking action today towards potential future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. This requires a governance system that supports current innovation for future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

The AIG model requires:
*   **Agency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>: The ability to use various tools and methods to understand the future, explore alternative scenarios, and possess the organizational capabilities for multidisciplinary work that translates insights into innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   **Authorizing Environment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>: A feedback system that legitimizes and values anticipatory work, including evaluation of current policies for future readiness, stress testing, and engaging citizens in discussions about desired futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

### The Finland Project
The project on [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] in Finland, conducted with the OECD, spans two years and resulted in a 350-page report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. The report provides a framework to assess anticipatory capacity in governments and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.

Key aspects of the project include:
*   **Assessment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>: An evaluation of the Finnish government and various organizations regarding their [[Anticipatory Innovation]] capacity, examining both public servants' agency and their authorizing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.
*   **Action Research and Pilots** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>: Initial assessments were followed by practical pilots in areas such as continuous learning, carbon neutrality, child well-being, and dialogues on the roles of politicians and administrative staff in an [[Anticipatory Innovation]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. These pilots aimed to put [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Challenges Identified** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>: Despite Finland having an advanced governance system, challenges hindering anticipation and innovation were found at organizational, individual, and procedural levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. These include difficulty translating innovations into policy, public servants being risk-averse, and the challenge of changing organizational philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.
*   **Thematic Issues Analyzed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>: The analysis focused on seven thematic issues: making [[Anticipatory Innovation]] more democratic, integrating futures and foresight into policy making, incorporating anticipatory knowledge into budget and investments, exploring alternatives, identifying necessary individual and organizational capacities, bridging policy cycles to maintain long-term development fields, and improving cross-government coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

## Key Recommendations and Implementation
The report proposes that [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] functions should be integrated into existing government functions rather than completely redoing the government structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. This includes strategic planning, budgetary decisions, legislation, human resource functions, and skill promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. The report also highlights the need for new government functions, such as a government transition function to ensure continuity of complex policies across government terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>, and clearer planning functions for analyzing emerging issues and assigning responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.

Specific action points for the Finnish government include:
*   Systemizing the transition process to improve continuity of long-term reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.
*   Developing methods to plan responses to emerging issues with assigned responsibility and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
*   Establishing structures for regular collective sense-making, visioning, and exploration of alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.
*   Testing new approaches to allocate project resources to emerging phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   Incorporating future-oriented data into fiscal planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   Developing regulatory approaches to support experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.
*   Designing training, teams, and roles to make anticipation a reality in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   Institutionalizing dialogue and deliberation around these topics to build trust among citizens, public officials, and politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
*   Connecting futures and foresight systems with the policy-making system to ensure a value chain of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
*   Tracking and assessing the use of anticipatory approaches to understand what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.

The Ministry of Finance, along with the AIG team, is responsible for coordinating and ensuring these areas are taken forward holistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>. Finland is already advancing in areas like citizen participation, developing Finnish National Dialogue models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. The pilots have demonstrated how to put suggestions into practice and identify what more is needed for full implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. Plans for a larger-scale implementation next year, potentially with support from the EU's Technical Support Instrument (TSI) and the OECD, are underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>. Specific focus areas before the upcoming elections include ensuring continuity of long-term reforms and establishing a standing committee or group to discuss anticipatory issues and integrate them into core processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

## European Context and Relevance
Recent events have highlighted that [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] and foresight are essential elements of public administration, especially as citizens turn to governments during changes and crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>. The European Commission supports member states in adopting [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] by providing financial and technical support, intellectual advice, and sharing inspiring project examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The Commission's Director-General for Structural Reform Support coordinates policy-making on the quality of public administration, drawing lessons from studies, comparisons, and exchanges with member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

European administrations face increasingly complex policy issues, including "super wicked problems" like climate change and black swan events such as COVID-19, set against complex multi-level governance and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Complexity can be managed with effective decision-making and cooperative systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

The Finnish experience is seen as a blueprint for other member states, demonstrating how a top-performing country like Finland continuously improves its capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. Key takeaways from the Finnish work for the EU include:
*   Increasing civil servants' capacity to reflect on future policy challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.
*   Creating long-term planning for short-term democracies through revised policy-making and budgetary processes, and improved dialogue between politicians and the public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

### Future Challenges for European Administrations
[[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] capacity will be central to addressing upcoming challenges in the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. These include:
1.  **Technological Challenge and Change** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>: Requires adapting administrative working and decision-making methods, enabling human-centricity in public service delivery, and rethinking/redesigning administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>.
2.  **Demographic Changes and Skills Shortage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:32">[01:29:32]</a>: New skills are needed to address these challenges and ensure the success of reform and recovery packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.
3.  **Increasing Complexity of Managing Policy Issues** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>: A culture of innovation is crucial within public administration at all levels of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:13">[01:38:13]</a>.
4.  **Impact of the Green Transition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58">[01:42:58]</a>: Administrations must ensure leadership, competence, a sound knowledge base, accountability, and transparency in policy-making to achieve climate neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
5.  **Competition for Limited Public Funding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>: Prioritization, leadership, innovative thinking, and improved financial management are necessary to address intergenerational fairness and understand future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>.

Building resilience in public administrations is the primary challenge, born from a combination of stable, efficient processes delivering quality services and a capacity for disruption to challenge, innovate, and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:55">[01:59:55]</a>. [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] capacity and the courage to challenge the status quo are vital opportunities for democratic societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:58">[02:00:58]</a>.

### Confidence in Governments' Anticipatory Capacity
A poll conducted during the discussion revealed that participants generally lack high confidence in their governments' ability to anticipate future risks and create opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:11">[01:45:11]</a>. No one was "very confident," and a consensus emerged around "somewhat" confident or "disagree" regarding clear and transparent ways to plan responses to emerging issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:46">[01:48:46]</a>. This highlights that there is still significant work to be done, even in leading countries like Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:57">[01:50:57]</a>.

## International Perspectives on AIG
Discussions with representatives from Norway, Portugal, and the Netherlands revealed similar challenges and aspirations regarding [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]].

### Netherlands
The AIG model could fit well in the Netherlands, an open country used to broad policy discussions with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>. While not yet structured like Finland's model, the Netherlands is trying similar approaches through smaller projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, for example, is working on issues like artificial intelligence, well-being economics, hyperloops, flying cars, data science, and digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. A key difficulty is translating innovations into policy, as public servants are often risk-averse, and creating room for a culture of innovation is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>. Long-term issues like infrastructure can be sustained with long-term funding across governments (e.g., an infrastructure fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. However, funding for new policies or those in the innovation phase remains difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. Dutch civil servants are equipped with an "innovation toolbox" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:49">[01:59:49]</a>.

### Norway
Norway shares similarities with Finland, particularly in its society and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. Finland is considered an ideal test bed for AIG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. Norway aims to strengthen a Nordic model by exploring and applying [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] and has initiatives at municipal, regional, and government levels to challenge silos and foster collaboration on complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

Examples of Norwegian anticipatory activities include:
*   Norwegian Defence Research Establishment's assignment on information influence on elections, presenting five scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>.
*   A 2019 white paper on [[Anticipatory Innovation in the Public Sector]] that developed public sector scenarios for 2040 to make innovation policies future-fit, highlighting foresight as a method and competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.
*   The "Seamless Services" program uses foresight methods to ensure new services meet future user needs, like "Life Event New in Norway," which identified strategic blind spots and developed future personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.

A key learning from Finland for Norway is the systematic connection of future support and systems to policy-making, which is often project-based rather than structural in Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. Norway's digitalization agency has an iterative approach, starting small and sharing cases and good examples to build anticipation and foresight in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>. Next steps could include developing future literacy and skills in targeted programs for public sector leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>.

### Portugal
Portugal, despite its geographical distance from Finland, faces similar challenges of uncertainty and mounting issues, making anticipatory approaches relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. PlanAPP, a new competence center at the center of the Portuguese government, focuses on planning, foresight, public policy monetization, and evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. PlanAPP is connected to the "HiPLA" network, which aims to cut across silos and provide holistic responses to future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

Portuguese initiatives include:
*   An [[Anticipatory Innovation]] starter kit developed with the OECD and the agency for modernization of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>.
*   The "Ministries of the Future" initiative and the European Union's network of foresight, launched during Portugal's 2021 EU Council presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   Line ministries (agriculture, infrastructure, economy, finance) have entities responsible for strategic thinking, innovation, and future anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>.
*   PlanAPP's critical role is to unlock and combine existing anticipatory capacities across the Portuguese public administration and promote information sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.
*   A project called "2050 Lab" aims for a participatory visioning project, gathering citizens' visions for Portugal's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

Key goals for Portugal include creating a culture inside the public administration that promotes and integrates foresight and innovation into daily practice, and reinforcing the skills and capacity of institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] is not an extra layer but an essential driver for public sector effectiveness, deeply integrated into the culture of a modern public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:01">[01:59:01]</a>. It helps governments remain dynamic, explore possibilities, experiment, and continuously learn within a broader governance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:09">[02:00:09]</a>. There is a direct link between citizens' trust in government and their perception of the government's ability to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:58">[02:06:58]</a>.

Finland's work provides a blueprint for other countries, demonstrating a commitment to continuously adjust governance functioning and rethink structures to support [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:39">[02:09:39]</a>. This pioneering work will inform upcoming projects in countries like Ireland (competency framework for senior leaders), Italy, Lithuania, Malta (capabilities), Sweden (anticipation and risk management), and Flanders, Belgium (anticipation for recovery and resilience plans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:14">[02:19:14]</a>. [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] approaches are critical for how governments work and deliver in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>.

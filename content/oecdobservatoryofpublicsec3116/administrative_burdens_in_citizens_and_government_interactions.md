Administrative burdens are defined as negative interactions or "frictions" that individuals experience when engaging with government services or benefits. These burdens are conceptualized as various types of costs incurred by citizens trying to access public services [00:03:00] [00:04:01].

## Types of Administrative Burdens

Professors Pam Herd and Don Moynihan, authors of "Administrative Burden: Policymaking by Other Means," categorize administrative burdens into three types of costs:

*   **Learning Costs**
    These are the costs associated with gathering information about public services and determining their relevance or eligibility [00:04:30] [00:04:38]. An example is the complex navigation required for Medicare, the U.S. public health insurance program for those aged 65 and older. Despite being a public system, its hybrid design with private insurance options makes it difficult for older adults to choose appropriate coverage annually, leading to significant financial and access consequences if incorrect choices are made [00:05:01] [00:05:50].

*   **Compliance Costs**
    These are the costs incurred when following rules and requirements, including paperwork, waiting times, fees, and providing documentation to prove eligibility [00:06:12] [00:06:36]. The Medicaid program in the U.S., which provides health insurance to low-income individuals, exemplifies compliance costs. Participants must annually prove their eligibility through a renewal process, which varies by state. This complexity often leads to "churn," where people lose coverage due to procedural reasons, only to re-enroll a short time later [00:07:27] [00:08:24].

*   **Psychological Costs**
    Beyond traditional notions of stigma, psychological costs encompass the stress, loss of autonomy, frustration, and even fear experienced by individuals navigating public processes [00:08:34] [00:09:29]. These costs can significantly impact public trust in government [00:09:39]. An example includes a single mother struggling to access food stamp documents during the pandemic, facing repeated digital failures [00:10:13] [00:10:39]. Another case involved 200,000 children in Tennessee losing health insurance due to changes in renewal forms, causing fear and anxiety when families discovered their coverage loss at doctors' offices [00:10:44] [00:11:18].

## Key Lessons from Research

Recent research on administrative burdens highlights several critical findings:

*   **Small Burdens Can Have Large Impacts**
    Seemingly minor administrative hurdles can significantly deter access to beneficial programs. For instance, an experiment involving a U.S. student loan forgiveness program, which had only about 30% enrollment among eligible individuals, showed that simply having the loan provider pre-fill the application form (requiring only a signature and email back) drastically increased application rates from 24% to 60%. This small change led to an average monthly payment reduction of about $125 for recipients [00:11:34] [00:13:36].

*   **[[impact_of_administrative_burdens_on_inequality | Implications for Inequality]]**
    Administrative burdens disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, exacerbating existing inequalities [00:13:39].
    *   Individuals most in need of help are often the least equipped to navigate complex systems due to factors like language barriers, illness, cognitive disabilities, or lack of time and money [00:13:49] [00:14:27].
    *   People tend to perform less effectively under conditions of scarcity, stress, or poor health, which are often prevalent among those seeking government assistance [00:14:29] [00:14:47].
    *   In contexts like the U.S., policies benefiting middle-class individuals tend to be easier to navigate (e.g., employer-subsidized health insurance), while programs for low-income populations (e.g., Medicaid) are often incredibly complex [00:14:52] [00:15:43].

*   **Effectiveness of Automatic Renewal**
    The most effective way to reduce administrative burdens is to move towards automated processes, shifting the burden from individuals to the state [00:16:03] [00:16:22]. While nudges can be effective for reducing learning costs, they are less impactful when significant compliance and psychological costs are present [00:16:46] [00:17:09].

## [[biden_administration_initiatives_to_reduce_administrative_burdens | Biden Administration Initiatives]] to Reduce Burdens

The Biden Administration in the U.S. has made efforts to reduce administrative burdens:

*   **Executive Orders**
    Early in its term, the administration signed executive orders on racial equity and a more extensive customer experience order in December 2021. This order explicitly links burden reduction to improving customer experience and public trust in government [00:17:53] [00:18:14].

*   **New Tools and Practices**
    The administration has introduced or emphasized new approaches such as [[citizen_centered_governance_and_its_challenges_during_cris | human-centered design]] for reviewing and designing government processes [00:18:42] [00:19:15].

*   **Repurposing Existing Processes**
    Existing governmental requirements, like mandatory performance reporting and the Paperwork Reduction Act, have been repurposed to focus more on measuring and reporting customer experience and burden reduction. The Paperwork Reduction Act, traditionally focused on time spent filling out forms, has been reinterpreted to include learning, compliance (beyond just form-filling, including documentation), and psychological costs [00:19:22] [00:20:23].

## Examples of Burden Reduction in Practice

Specific initiatives illustrate successful approaches to reducing burdens:

*   **Medicaid Automatic Renewal (Ex Parte)**
    The Biden Administration encouraged states to expand automatic renewal for Medicaid, known as "ex parte" renewals. This allows states to automatically renew eligibility if they have sufficient data, avoiding the need for beneficiaries to submit paperwork [00:21:22] [00:21:57]. As a result, the national average for automatic Medicaid renewals increased significantly from about one in four to almost one in two people between 2023 and 2024, saving millions of people from paperwork and risk of losing coverage [00:22:24] [00:23:05].

*   **Minnesota Project with Code for America**
    In Minnesota, a project with the nonprofit Civic Tech firm Code for America focused on expanding automatic renewal for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled population, a group particularly vulnerable to paperwork struggles [00:23:17] [00:23:44]. Code for America utilized its technological skills to help the state organize and connect administrative data sources, providing easily digestible information to caseworkers. This intervention dramatically increased automatic renewal rates for this population from about 40% to nearly 80% [00:24:03] [00:25:03]. Critically, this automatic renewal process also appeared to "level the playing field," increasing enrollment for non-white families to be consistent with average rates, thereby helping to reduce [[impact_of_administrative_burdens_on_inequality | inequalities]] [00:25:16] [00:26:07].

*   **US Digital Service Intervention**
    The U.S. Digital Service (USDS), a civic tech organization working within government, sent "tiger teams" of digital experts to states to help improve Medicaid renewal processes. These teams provided technical capacity (identifying data sources, reviewing code for errors) and policy capacity (clarifying federal flexibility, maximizing opportunities). This intervention helped lower-performing states improve their automatic renewal rates to the national average, even as the national average continued to rise [00:26:13] [00:28:33].

## [[role_of_technology_and_digitalization_in_reducing_administrative_burdens | Challenges and Considerations for Technology and Digitalization]]

While technology can be a great enabler for reducing burdens by shifting responsibilities from the public to the state [00:32:25] [00:32:35], its application requires careful consideration:

*   **Automation Pitfalls**
    Blind faith in technology can lead to increased burdens and negative outcomes. Cases in Australia and the Netherlands demonstrated how algorithms used for fraud detection in welfare and childcare benefits led to significant false positives, disproportionately focused on minimizing fraud over maintaining access, and lacked sufficient human oversight. This resulted in new burdens for clients who had to prove their innocence, causing severe negative consequences, including the downfall of the Dutch government [00:28:33] [0:30:20].

*   **Digital Divide and Inequality**
    Digitalization can exacerbate [[impact_of_administrative_burdens_on_inequality | inequality]] due to unequal access to digital tools or skills. Older adults, for instance, often struggle with digital interfaces and are less likely to be regular internet users [00:48:05] [00:48:41].
    *   The intent behind technology use is crucial: it can be used to either increase or decrease burdens [00:49:04] [00:49:31].
    *   A principle for government is to create an "easy road" for most of the population, then reallocate resources to assist the remaining individuals who face difficulties or unusual situations due to technology or life circumstances [00:49:50] [00:50:15].

*   **Privacy Concerns**
    The balance between privacy and access is a significant [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenge]]. While privacy is a valid concern, government agencies may sometimes overvalue it relative to citizen access. Citizens often express confusion as to why governments don't use existing data to automate processes, highlighting a behavioral preference for convenience over strict privacy, especially given how easily people share data with private entities [00:58:08] [00:59:34]. A "do no harm" policy for data sharing, where data is used to benefit rather than punish citizens, can help navigate this balance [01:00:06] [01:00:24].

## Lessons for Governments

A report published in December 2023 by Pam Herd, Don Moynihan, and Amy Woodman outlined key lessons for governments seeking to reduce burdens:

*   **Cultivate a [[citizen_centered_governance_and_its_challenges_during_cris | Citizen-Centered Culture]]**
    Governments need to build a culture that prioritizes the public's experience of administrative processes, using tools like [[citizen_centered_governance_and_its_challenges_during_cris | human-centered design]] and journey mapping [00:30:45] [00:31:02].

*   **Build Capacity**
    Changing practices requires dedicated capacity. Successful agencies in burden reduction often have dedicated customer experience staff whose primary role is to review and revise processes based on public feedback [00:31:06] [00:31:33].

*   **Foster Collaboration**
    Redesigning processes often necessitates collaboration between multiple agencies, particularly for data sharing to simplify eligibility verification [00:31:33] [00:31:53].

*   **Simplify Processes and Review Regularly**
    Governments are good at adding new rules and systems but often less effective at reviewing their ongoing effectiveness. Establishing processes for regular review is crucial to ensure systems remain fit for purpose [00:31:56] [00:32:21].

*   **Leverage Technology Wisely**
    [[role_of_technology_and_digitalization_in_reducing_administrative_burdens | Technology is a powerful enabler]] for shifting burdens from the public to the state by leveraging administrative data. However, it requires careful implementation to avoid introducing biases or creating new burdens, as seen in cases where automation failed [00:32:25] [00:32:44].

## Measurement and Behavioral Science

Measuring administrative burdens, especially learning and psychological costs, remains a [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenge]], particularly for those who never attempt to access services [00:35:11] [00:35:58].

*   **Measuring Learning and Psychological Costs**
    *   Take-up rates are helpful, but direct measurement of barriers to entry for non-applicants is difficult [00:35:28] [00:35:58].
    *   Qualitative methods, such as focus groups with community organizations and direct interviews with individuals, can provide insights [00:36:01] [00:36:39].
    *   Specific short measures for psychological costs can be integrated into surveys [00:36:43] [00:37:08].
    *   Randomized control trials (RCTs) can help identify the type of barrier (e.g., stigma, learning, or compliance) by testing different interventions [00:37:42] [00:38:55].
    *   For those who do interact with programs, simple, short user surveys (e.g., via text or pop-up) at various stages of the process can effectively measure burdens and track patterns [00:38:59] [00:40:08]. Research shows that uncertainty and waiting for answers significantly contribute to perceived burden [00:40:21] [00:40:39].

*   **Role of Behavioral Science**
    Behavioral Science brings valuable skills to administrative burden reduction:
    *   **Rigorous Evaluation:** Conducting AB testing or RCTs to determine the effectiveness of pilot programs, or using pre-post analyses for reasonable estimates [00:51:40] [00:52:03].
    *   **Documentation and Peer Review:** Systematically writing up results and seeking peer review to establish credibility, which governments often lack the resources or time for [00:52:09] [00:52:29].
    *   **Integrating Design Thinking:** Familiarizing practitioners with [[citizen_centered_governance_and_its_challenges_during_cris | human-centered design]] and journey mapping to modernize approaches to government problems [00:52:33] [00:52:50].
    *   **Emphasis on Evaluation:** Reminding practitioners that intuitive solutions don't always work as expected, and robust evaluation is crucial to ensure interventions genuinely reduce burdens and improve outcomes [00:53:03] [00:54:09].

The modern world, characterized by interconnected risks and rapid [[impacts_of_technological_change_on_regulation | technological change]], necessitates a fundamental reconsideration of how governments devise, develop, and implement regulations [00:01:18]. Data plays a crucial role in shaping a future-fit public sector, enabling governments to create governance guardrails that prevent technology from causing harm to citizens or markets [00:03:21].

## Data as a Foundation for Agile Regulatory Governance

The OECD's recommendation on [[agile_regulatory_governance | agile regulatory governance]] emphasizes the need to adjust regulatory management tools to ensure regulations are "fit for the future" [00:09:21]. A core aspect of this is the development of governance frameworks that provide horizon scanning, scenario analysis, and monitoring of regulatory implications, which inherently rely on data [00:12:37].

Regulators require the capacity in their offices to work with data effectively [00:13:04]. Regulation should not only be future-oriented but also [[goalbased_regulation_in_digital_transformation | outcome-focused]], meaning its real-life effects must be understood and measured using data to determine if goals are reached [00:13:18]. This requires regulators to be courageous enough to clearly define their goals and collect the necessary data [00:13:46].

The ideal regulatory function shifts from being a "policeman" or "watchdog" to a "support function," a "champion for the public" that uses frameworks to guide innovation [00:14:14]. This transformational approach relies heavily on data-driven insights.

## Data in Practice: European Initiatives and Industry Perspectives

### Agile Nations Network
The Agile Nations Network, an intergovernmental initiative, aims to foster international cooperation on rulemaking and practical activities to promote [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation-friendly]] ways of handling emerging technologies [00:16:22]. This network seeks to share foresight and evidence on the opportunities and risks of innovation, enabling timely regulatory reform [00:19:20]. International cooperation and knowledge sharing, underpinned by data and evidence, are considered crucial to avoid unnecessary divergence in rules that could hinder cross-border innovation [00:18:54].

### Regulatory Sandboxes and Data Protection
[[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | Regulatory sandboxes]] are key examples of flexible, innovation-friendly, and future-proof regulatory frameworks [00:23:19]. They facilitate the development, testing, and validation of innovative systems in a controlled, temporary environment [00:27:54]. However, the use of data within these sandboxes raises specific concerns, especially regarding data protection, as seen with the EU's Artificial Intelligence Act proposal [00:22:50].

While sandboxes can provide a learning environment for supervisory authorities to become accustomed to new technologies, the primary benefit observed is for regulators to learn about barriers and technologies [01:10:05]. The process of how these experiments translate into formal regulation is still nascent [01:14:51].

### European Commission's Approach
The European Commission is actively refining its "better regulation" system, recognizing the accelerating pace of change and the impact of crises like COVID-19 [00:50:07]. Key improvements include:
*   **Flexible and Agile Consultation:** Emphasizing engagement with stakeholders to find the right ways to include diverse perspectives [00:50:58].
*   **Strategic Foresight:** Investing in foresight to anticipate future challenges and integrate this dimension into regulatory work [00:52:17].
*   **Transparency of Evidence:** Making evidence, models, and databases underpinning proposals more accessible for scrutiny and discussion [00:52:54].
*   **Digital Dimension Integration:** Systematically integrating the [[digital_transformation_and_data_governance | digital dimension]] into all aspects of regulatory work, from consultations and impact assessments to evaluations [00:54:20]. This includes concepts like "digital by default" and "once only" principles [00:54:40].
*   **Data Science and AI for Internal Work:** The Commission is increasingly using data science and AI to exploit large volumes of contributions from consultations and for new ways of engaging with citizens [00:59:05].

## Challenges and Future Considerations
Several challenges and future considerations highlight the need for continued data-driven approaches:

*   **Accountability of Regulators:** Industry stakeholders emphasize the need for regulators to be accountable for their decisions, similar to businesses being accountable to shareholders [00:34:02]. Being [[goalbased_regulation_in_digital_transformation | outcome-focused]] and collecting data is vital for demonstrating results to taxpayers [00:36:02].
*   **Knowledge Gap and Upskilling:** There is a significant knowledge gap between regulators and technologists, particularly concerning digital and emerging technologies [01:15:46]. Upskilling policymakers and citizens in technology is crucial [00:37:50]. This requires platforms that protect intellectual property (IP) while facilitating knowledge sharing, preventing smaller innovators from being at a disadvantage [01:17:16].
*   **"Fail Fast" and Iterative Regulation:** The concept of "minimum viable product" (MVP) from the tech world suggests that regulation should be released in small ways, observed, and then adjusted based on results [00:43:00]. This [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile approach]], akin to how governments responded during COVID-19, allows for faster adaptation when technology quickly evolves [00:44:23].
*   **Interconnectivity and Global Approach:** Monitoring interconnectivity in technology is paramount [00:46:08]. A global approach to regulation, similar to international efforts during the pandemic, is needed for areas like cybersecurity [00:47:09]. Governments must be proactive in fostering a positive [[agile_regulatory_governance | agile ecosystem]] where data-driven insights lead to faster problem identification and citizen protection [00:47:50].
*   **Regulatory Simplification vs. Complexity:** While "better regulation" emphasizes simplification and burden reduction, [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile regulation]] in complex technological realms can appear more intricate [01:27:01]. The balance lies in being flexible and pragmatic, directly engaging with relevant experts while ensuring fairness and avoiding competitive advantages [01:28:44].

Ultimately, the goal is for all regulation to embody agility, becoming dynamic and responsive to the evolving landscape of innovation and societal needs [01:37:59]. This future relies on robust [[data_governance_and_digitallyenabled_state | data governance]] and a commitment to data-driven decision-making.

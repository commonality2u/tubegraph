The COVID-19 pandemic significantly highlighted the crucial importance of public trust for the effectiveness of public policies, impacting areas such as compliance with restrictions and vaccine uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Public services were [[covid19_responses_and_government_adaptability | adapted during the crisis]], often utilizing digital technologies to keep citizens safe and meet their expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. However, a significant risk, seen in previous crises like the global financial crisis, is that some citizens may feel alienated or left behind, particularly if public services do not reach them or meet their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Drivers of Trust

The OECD's trust framework indicates that trust in institutions is driven by the responsiveness and reliability of services, as well as perceptions of their fairness, openness, and integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Governments with higher initial trust at the pandemic's onset also experienced higher levels of health behavior adoption and pro-social behaviors among citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This suggests that trust is key to [[covid19_responses_and_government_adaptability | effective government responses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Challenges to Government-Citizen Relationships

### Increased Distance and Polarization
Polls conducted during the pandemic suggest an increased distance between citizens and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. In Spain, both external political efficacy (citizens' perception of the political system's openness to their needs) and internal political efficacy (citizens' perception of their capacity to influence politics) dropped between August 2020 and June 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. The pandemic also exacerbated societal divisions, notably between those in favor of and against vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

### Misinformation and Social Media
The spread of misinformation on social media poses a significant challenge, making it difficult for governments to maintain fact-based discussions amidst a "reality show" environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. Governments struggle to balance freedom of speech with preventing the spread of fake stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

### Communication and Transparency
While transparency is crucial, an overreliance on constant social media engagement can lead to reactive rather than proactive policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. Clear, timely communication is vital for building trust and improving public perception of government performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Leaders telling "difficult truths" rather than sugarcoating situations has been shown to be more effective in increasing trust, as seen in Denmark compared to the US under Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. Simplicity in communication is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

### Digital Divide and Inequality
[[Impact of Covid19 on digital transformation in the public sector | Digitalization]], while enabling rapid delivery of services (e.g., unemployment benefits in Latvia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>), also creates a gap between citizens and government, especially for vulnerable groups like indigenous people and the elderly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. Online participation often reproduces existing inequalities, with women, immigrants, and other less represented groups being less active in online political tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. Furthermore, the pandemic has disproportionately affected women, exacerbating [[impact_of_covid19_on_genderbased_violence | gender inequality]] in political efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Governmental Silos
Competition between government ministries, each representing different interest groups (e.g., education, health, economy), can lead to competing interests within society and hinder cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.

## Fostering Inclusivity and Trust

### Importance of the Local Level
Focusing on the local level is fundamental for building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. Local leaders and community-based policies have proven effective, as seen in Bangladesh and Sierra Leone, where working with communities led to better compliance with measures and vaccination uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Local communication is also easier and less ideologically driven than national communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

### Empowering Public Employees
Public servants have continued to deliver services effectively during the pandemic, often working from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. Empowering public employees and giving them ownership in policy design and implementation is crucial for improving [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_public_employment | public sector performance]] and connecting better with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.

### Humble Government and Collaboration
A "humble government" approach involves recognizing what is unknown, publicly admitting limitations, and actively asking citizens and the private sector for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. This fosters flexibility and a willingness to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. Examples like Singapore's government collaborating with startups to generate solutions to social problems demonstrate this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.

### Inclusive Policy-Making Tools
*   **Co-creation and Design Thinking:** Engaging all stakeholders, including doctors, nurses, hospital managers, and insurance companies, in the design of policies (e.g., a new salary system for doctors in Latvia) fosters a sense of being heard and leads to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.
*   **Continuous Feedback:** Building services that allow for continuous feedback from users helps maintain trust by showing that citizens' views are being considered and used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.
*   **Participation Mechanisms:** Governments need to design diverse participation mechanisms that cater to citizens who want to participate actively and those who prefer to trust politicians to do what is right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Community Structures:** Instead of creating new mechanisms, governments should leverage existing community engagement methods and community trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>.
*   **Simple Facilitation Tools:** Techniques like "1+2+4" discussions (individual thinking, then pairs, then larger groups) and "empathy maps" (stakeholders expressing what they think others believe about them) can significantly improve engagement and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Future Outlook

A majority of poll participants felt that governments have not learned lessons from the 2008 financial crisis to build more inclusive economies in the wake of COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>. Key challenges identified include reaching forgotten groups and a perceived lack of vision and leadership to move beyond old ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

The pandemic has exposed fundamental problems and highlighted the need for [[future_of_public_governance_postcovid19 | adaptive societies]] to deal with future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>. There is a critical juncture where governments must decide whether to revert to old practices or integrate the changes and lessons learned during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>. This requires:
*   **New Leadership:** Leaders with skills in humility, flexibility, and collaboration across different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sectoral Coordination:** Moving away from silos and enhancing coordination between different government levels and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.
*   **Accountability:** A dream for the future is to establish legal mechanisms for politicians to be accountable for their decisions beyond their term, fostering a long-term policy vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.
*   **Flexible Policy-Making:** Shifting from rigid policy cycles to a diverse toolbox of instruments, including big data analysis, ethnographic interviews, user experience, and quick surveys, while embracing flexibility and new ways of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

The [[impact_of_pandemic_on_government_practice | pandemic has forced]] governments to become fully digital and adopt hybrid work models, necessitating new tools and approaches for internal communication and co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>. Ultimately, building more inclusive public policy tools and institutions can serve as a basis for better services, empower citizens, and strengthen public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.

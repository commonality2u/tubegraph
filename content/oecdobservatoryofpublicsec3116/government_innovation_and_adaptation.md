The International Conference on Governments Beyond Recovery and Towards a Future-Fit Public Sector, a virtual event hosted by the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU, the OECD Observatory for [[Public Sector Innovation | Public Sector Innovation]], and the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA), with support from the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program, convened to explore opportunities for public governance [00:00:01]. The conference aims to discuss how [[innovation in government | innovation]], [[adaptive innovation | adaptation]], strategic foresight, and co-creation can shape a better future for governments, societies, and people [00:00:47].

## Inspirational Insights from Petra Majdič

Petra Majdič, a former cross-country skiing champion and successful businesswoman, shared her experiences on leadership, teamwork, and [[adaptive innovation | innovation]] [00:02:03].

> "I never had the feeling that I'm a leader. I always felt that I'm just one of them, part of my team." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>

Majdič emphasized the importance of building a dependable team based on trust and reliability, noting that this approach is always rewarded [00:03:21]. Her personal experience at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, where she won a medal with five broken ribs after a severe fall during warm-up, underscored the critical role of her team in motivating her and preparing equipment, highlighting that she could not have succeeded without them [00:03:34].

### Daring to be Different
Coming from Slovenia, a small country with fewer financial resources for athletes compared to nations like Norway or Sweden, Majdič was "forced to find [[adaptive innovation | innovative]] ways" to achieve similar training conditions [00:05:31]. She recounted an instance where her team changed the traditional racing suit colors (blue, red, black, white) to a unique design [00:06:01]. This made her perfectly visible, attracted new sponsors, and no one copied it, leading her to realize that "dare to be different is not a handicap, but it's an opportunity" [00:06:36].

### The Necessity of Adaptation
Majdič believes that children are like "human chameleons," capable of being different things in different moments, but as adults, people become afraid of failure and lose their flexible, [[adaptive innovation | innovative]] thinking [00:07:14]. Her career, marked by over 500 races, taught her never to take the status quo for granted [00:09:56]. She notes that her business career was not significantly affected by the COVID-19 crisis because her sport career instilled in her the need for [[adaptive innovation | adaptation]] [00:09:17]. Top athletes are often role models, and Majdič champions integrity as a core value for all, including governments, especially in times of crisis [00:10:09].

## OECD's Perspective on Government Responsiveness

Matthias Corman, Secretary General of the OECD, highlighted how [[innovation in government | governments]] were seriously challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic but responded boldly and decisively, supporting businesses and households, and saving lives [00:13:19]. Public support across the OECD, through increased spending and other measures, amounted to a massive 27% of GDP [00:13:35]. The global economic outlook is improving, driven by extensive policy support, rapid vaccine development, and accelerating digital transformation [00:14:00].

### Future Priorities for Governments
Looking ahead, governments must focus on both immediate and medium-to-longer-term priorities [00:14:56]. These include:
*   Optimizing recovery strength and quality [00:15:04].
*   Tackling climate change with more ambitious and globally coordinated action [00:15:08].
*   Seizing opportunities from digital transformation while managing risks [00:15:15].
*   Strengthening global markets and a rules-based multilateral trading system [00:15:24].
*   Strengthening [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | international cooperation]] [00:15:42].

Corman emphasized that policy support should remain flexible and targeted, moving towards future-focused investment in green and digital transitions and infrastructure [00:15:55]. He also stressed the importance of promoting equality of opportunities and fostering social mobility [00:16:38].

### Embedding Innovation and Foresight
A key pillar for collective response to climate change is access to better data on policy effort and impact [00:16:55]. The OECD has proposed a framework to G20 and OECD members to facilitate a more coherent and globally coordinated approach to carbon pricing [00:17:02]. Furthermore, public sectors need to strategically embed [[innovation in government | innovation]] and foresight into policymaking, a commitment central to the OECD Declaration on [[Public Sector Innovation | Public Sector Innovation]], adopted by 43 countries [01:00:06].

## Slovenian Prime Minister's View: Lessons from COVID-19

Prime Minister Janez Janša of Slovenia emphasized the honor of co-hosting the conference during a time of pandemic and recovery [00:20:06]. He noted that the concept of a "future-fit public sector" became especially relevant during the initial weeks of the pandemic [00:20:30].

### Preparedness and Flexibility
Janša highlighted two crucial factors for addressing challenges: preparedness and flexibility [00:22:42]. He noted a "vast variety of approaches" among countries [00:22:57]. Slovenia, like many EU members, was not well-prepared for the pandemic despite prior recommendations from the World Health Organization [00:24:15]. This unpreparedness led to struggles in response, with the public sector at the crossroads of this challenge [00:24:20].

He observed that while some countries with less democratic systems and quick decision-making abilities seemed more effective at the outset of the pandemic, the [[innovation in government | innovation]] needed for vaccines came from countries with free markets, freedom, and democracy [00:44:01].

### Digital Transformation and Data Sharing
Janša stressed the role of [[government innovation during COVID19 | digital transformation]] in helping responses [00:28:48]. If all data had been online and shared across the European Union or OECD countries, the response to the pandemic could have been much more timely and targeted [00:28:51]. The initial European response, marked by new borders and chaos, underscored the need to upgrade systems for regional and continental coordination, leading to a more successful second phase [00:25:10].

> "This was more or less the same, I know better the situation in Europe, maybe there were two, free countries inside of the European Union, but they were prepared, more or less prepared for the challenge, and all others we all know and also the response on the European level, if you are speaking about the coordinated efforts at the beginning, there was no response." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>

### Future Challenges and Innovation
Janša cautioned that similar or even more serious challenges, such as a serious cyberattack coinciding with a pandemic, could arise in the next 5-10 years [00:29:56]. Such scenarios could drastically impact the public sector if digital tools are not robust [00:30:57]. He believes the pandemic should serve as a "call to awareness" to be better prepared and take warning signals seriously [00:31:22].

Regarding climate change, Janša views [[innovation in government | innovation]] as the biggest answer, emphasizing the need to invest more in technologies that bring clean energy [00:52:03]. He highlighted a Slovenian company, BIA Separations, which developed technology for cleansing vaccines, leading to more secure shots at lower prices [00:57:32].

He asserted that climate change must be solved at the global level and that the EU is crucial in leading this effort with ambitious goals like becoming CO2 neutral by 2050 [01:03:50]. However, he noted that the transition to electric cars faces challenges due to limited lithium resources, requiring new materials and significant investment in this area [01:04:31].

## EIPA's Vision for People-Centric Innovation

Marco Ongaro, Director General of EIPA, emphasized that "what matters really is people" in driving change, reorganization, and [[innovation in government | innovation]] in both the private and public sectors [00:34:40]. He acknowledged that public administrations, faced with an unprecedented crisis, performed "quite a good job" given the information available at the time [00:35:04].

### Rethinking and Adapting
Ongaro shared an anecdote from an intensive care unit head, illustrating the need to "put all my knowledge, all my experience back on the table and re-think differently" when confronted with novel challenges like COVID-19 [00:35:50]. This mindset of thinking differently is crucial for public administrations [00:36:09].

### Inclusion and Workforce Development
Inclusion is a very important element, as the pandemic highlighted the essential role of "invisible" professions like nurses, supermarket clerks, and truck drivers [00:36:43]. Their voices should be heard, and public administrations should be more inclusive in their recruitment, seeking people with mindsets geared towards [[innovation in government | innovation]], change management, and [[adaptive innovation | adaptation]] [00:37:35].

Ongaro stressed that technology is an enabler, not a solution in itself, and requires people to use it effectively [00:39:31]. He noted the high percentage of hospital orders still processed via fax machines as an example of technology not being fully integrated [00:39:59]. Therefore, education and lifelong learning are vital for people to retrain and adapt to a rapidly changing world [00:40:30].

### Bridging Public and Private Sectors
From his private sector experience, Ongaro suggested that public administrations could benefit from empowering people to improve processes rather than just following established procedures [01:12:10]. Recruitment and evaluation should focus more on the ability to react to situations rather than rote memorization of knowledge [01:13:17]. He advocates for lowering barriers between the private and public sectors to encourage mutual understanding and collaboration [01:15:06].

## Challenges and Future Outlook

A poll conducted during the conference revealed a balanced public opinion on governments' ability to face complex challenges post-pandemic, with slight optimism [00:48:30]. Janša found it surprising that trust in science varied significantly across Europe, with western Europe showing higher trust than central and eastern Europe [00:50:22]. This lack of trust in science is a problem, especially when making decisions about complex issues like climate change [00:51:38].

### Cooperation and Bureaucracy
Both Janša and Ongaro agreed that [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | knowledge sharing and cooperation]] within Europe are "not enough" [01:16:00]. While the EU has a "huge treasure" in the diverse solutions found by its member states for various problems, this knowledge is not exploited enough due to bureaucratic obstacles [01:16:06].

Ongaro noted that cooperation between organizations like EIPA, OECD, and the EU Commission is increasing, indicating a move in the right direction [01:19:04].

### Moving Forward
Janša stated that a key lesson from the pandemic is the need for Europe to be better prepared for future challenges, including creating a health union [01:21:11]. He emphasized the importance of fostering an [[adaptive innovation in public services | innovation-friendly society]] and teaching citizens from a young age how to use information, prioritize, and develop skills for good [01:21:45].

Ongaro stressed that better cooperation between EU countries is essential for facing future challenges [01:23:07]. He advocates for changing the way EIPA advises and trains, bringing people from different countries together to share knowledge and avoid "reinventing the wheel" with recovery plans [01:23:20]. He hopes for more physical meetings post-COVID to facilitate this collaboration [01:24:34].

The overall sentiment is that while there is still work to be done, the experience of the pandemic has provided valuable lessons that can drive [[government innovation for delivering better value | innovation]] and adaptation in the public sector.

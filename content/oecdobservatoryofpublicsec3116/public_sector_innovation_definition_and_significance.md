[[public_sector_innovation | Public sector innovation]] is defined as something novel that is implemented in its context and results in a shift in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Characteristics of Innovation
An innovation can vary in scale, being either big or small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The process of innovating can be more or less certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It can emerge in a directed, top-down manner or from a bottom-up, undirected approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Need for a Model
Given that [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] has many different [[types_and_purposes_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | facets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, there is a need for a framework to understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. To address this, the OECD Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] developed a [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This model is based on two core features: how directed the innovation is, and how uncertain the process is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Four Facets of Innovation
From these two axes, four different [[types_and_purposes_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | facets of innovation]] emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:

*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>: This type aims to make existing products, services, and processes more effective and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. An example is using behavioural insights to encourage timely tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>: This innovation type sets out to solve specific problems and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Historical examples include getting to the moon, while contemporary examples include switching to sustainable energy to combat climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>: This involves trying to influence future developments before they become fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. For instance, exploring the ethical and technological boundaries that artificial intelligence projects should adhere to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>: This is the exploration of what is possible and the process of discovering what could be or might be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. An example is how social media introduced new ways for government and citizens to interact, reshaping expectations and creating new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Significance of a Balanced Portfolio
Since [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is multifaceted, there is no single, one-size-fits-all approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Concentrating on only one or two [[types_and_purposes_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | facets]] will lead to uneven [[public_sector_innovation_methods_and_strategies | innovation efforts]] and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Therefore, government needs a balanced [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly highlighted the complexities and necessities of [[interconnectedness_and_global_cooperation_during_the_covid19_pandemic | international cooperation]]. While drawing attention to national responses, the crisis has undeniably increased the importance for national governments to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A poll conducted indicated that 71% of respondents felt there was a greater need for nations to collaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

## Overall Impact and Trends

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound [[impacts_and_vulnerabilities_revealed_by_covid19 | impact]] on [[interconnectedness_and_global_cooperation_during_the_covid19_pandemic | international cooperation]], revealing a global crisis that can only be effectively managed through global cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. However, the pandemic also reinforced existing trends towards unilateralism and, in some cases, outright conflict between nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

While the international scientific community demonstrated exemplary collaboration by sharing the virus's DNA sequence and research, leading to rapid vaccine development, cooperation among governments has been far more haphazard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

The crisis has also raised questions about the future of globalization. The globalization of goods had already slowed after the 2008 crisis, and there is concern about further erosion of the multilateral system post-COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Conversely, the pandemic has fostered "virtual globalization," exemplified by online conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

The pandemic serves as a "stress test" for how humanity manages the Global Commons and addresses other profound transboundary challenges like climate change, inequalities, and aging populations, all of which require international cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Challenges to Effective Cooperation

Despite the clear need for greater [[interconnectedness_and_global_cooperation_during_the_covid19_pandemic | international cooperation]], several structural issues hinder optimal collaboration:
*   **Politics:** States are often unwilling to grant international organizations enforcement or inspection powers, and geopolitical tensions remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   **Financing:** International organizations often suffer from chronic underfunding from governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.
*   **Capacity:** Many developing countries lack the resources and capacity to implement their international obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide:** Different countries gather data in disparate ways, posing a significant challenge to creating interoperability between data and [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_health_innovations | digital health innovations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

## Impact on Health and Trade

### Health Sector
In the health sector, the World Health Organization (WHO), despite high expectations, has limited enforcement powers, primarily focusing on technical guidance, data provision, and coordinating initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. The crisis has prompted some countries, like Germany within the EU, to advocate for WHO reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

An "exciting development" is COVAX, a multilateral initiative bringing together over 160 states, non-state actors, and philanthropic foundations to achieve universal vaccine access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. However, it faces challenges with insufficient funding and the non-participation of some countries like the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

### Trade Sector
Initial reactions in trade were unilateral, marked by export bans, which severely impacted global supply chains and consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The first few weeks of the pandemic were particularly difficult for businesses due to these restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. However, existing trade agreements and [[interconnectedness_and_global_cooperation_during_the_covid19_pandemic | international cooperation]] helped restore supply chains relatively quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) played a role through the Trade Facilitation Agreement, which aided in removing red tape for essential goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. Despite criticism, the WTO continues to provide vital trade data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. Long-standing structural issues within the WTO, such as the difficulty of reaching agreements among diverse interests, have led to deadlocked negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. This deadlock has fueled interest in regional trade agreements, such as the recently concluded RCEP, and more flexible agreements among "coalitions of the willing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

There is a need to restore trust in global supply chains, as modern products are made from parts originating "all over the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. The concept of "made in the global world" rather than specific countries better reflects current economic realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

## Evolving Forms of Collaboration

The crisis has shown that less formal collaboration can occur alongside codified, structural cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

### IP Global AI Network (IP-GAN)
An example of this emerging collaboration is the IP Global AI Network (IP-GAN), a proof-of-concept platform developed by IP Australia with support from the UK, European, and US offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. National IP offices possess vast datasets but often develop similar AI solutions separately, and less-resourced offices lack access to experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

IP-GAN aims to:
*   Foster [[interconnectedness_and_global_cooperation_during_the_covid19_pandemic | international collaboration]] and co-development of practices and technology around machine learning for patent offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
*   Reduce duplication of effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   Provide a secure way to openly share AI tool development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.
*   Overcome aspects of the digital divide by sharing expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

Functioning like an app store or marketplace, IP-GAN includes a platform, browser access to AI tools, APIs, and a code repository for sharing and licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. Its success depends on uptake and overcoming national differences in security standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

### Role of International Organizations (IOs)
Traditional multilateral actors, particularly international organizations, faced increased pressure and criticism during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. These bodies, often viewed as slow or distant bureaucracies, struggled with organizing international meetings due to lockdowns and travel restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

However, IOs are crucial for supporting governments in developing effective policies, offering spaces for exchange, and agreeing on common approaches through international rules and standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

To improve multilateralism:
*   **Diverse IO Landscape:** The IO landscape is becoming more diverse, including private standard-setting bodies (e.g., for product safety) and transgovernmental networks of regulators (e.g., for specialized regulatory units and technical experts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. Governments should view all these actors as part of a common rule-based system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>.
*   **Individual IO Reforms:** Many IOs are undertaking reforms to enhance inclusivity, stakeholder consultation, impact assessment, and coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>. During COVID-19, many adapted working methods to virtually adopt decisions and rules under time pressure, providing targeted policy advice and developing dedicated instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>. For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization developed guides for aviation continuity, and Intercall developed guidelines for law enforcement protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.
*   **Collective Improvement:** A collective undertaking of 50 IO partners, the IO Partnership for Effective International Rulemaking (OECD acts as Secretariat), is committed to improving the quality of their rulemaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. This initiative aims for more inclusive rules (better stakeholder engagement), more effective rules (better evaluation), more systematically implemented rules (better support), and more coherent rules (stronger coordination) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The crisis has reinforced that the notion of a country or nation-state is not outdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. However, it has also become clear that governments are increasingly working alongside other actors, such as multinational companies, NGOs, and virtual interest-based groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>. The rise of multi-stakeholder partnerships is evident, especially for public issues like environment or health, where purely governmental cooperation is becoming "somewhat outdated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>. Governments are increasingly dependent on non-state actors for data and knowledge, fostering greater cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the best solution to future crises involves open societies, [[interconnectedness_and_global_cooperation_during_the_covid19_pandemic | international regulatory cooperation]], and trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. The lessons learned from events like the export ban on medical equipment during the pandemic must inform future preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. Going forward, the focus will be on leveraging technology and promoting collaboration across borders involving NGOs, businesses, and civil society, not just traditional government-to-government interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

The extraordinary pace and complexity of change are critical to the [[challenges_faced_by_public_servants | challenges]] governments face today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It is increasingly clear that governments must adopt new and [[innovative approaches in public sector leadership | innovative approaches]] to tackle major societal issues such as climate change, infectious diseases, and digital disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) aims to embed innovation at the core of government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. OPSI's work focuses on empowering [[Capacity Building for Civil Servants | public servants]] by providing them with:
*   New insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

These resources help [[Capacity Building for Civil Servants | public servants]] to explore new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Key Activities

OPSI achieves its goals through several key activities:
*   Conducting cutting-edge research to identify emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Collaborating with leading experts to offer trusted advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Transforming new approaches into standard practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The work of OPSI spans globally, reaching both OECD countries and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Anticipating and Acting Together

While governments are expected to face more [[challenges_faced_by_public_servants | challenges]] in the future, collective effort can enable anticipation and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This collaborative approach supports the development of better and more [[innovative approaches in public sector leadership | innovative policies]], ultimately leading to better lives for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

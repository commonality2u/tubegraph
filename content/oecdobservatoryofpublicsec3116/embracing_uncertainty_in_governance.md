## The Reality of Uncertainty
Modern governance, shaped by the 20th century, was designed for predictable environments with established routines and available knowledge bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. However, the COVID-19 pandemic served as a stark reminder that stability is fictional, and the future can be highly uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. In such times, governments cannot afford to stand still; the cost of late action or inaction can be severely high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. The focus for contemporary governance must shift to embracing uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

A key challenge highlighted by the pandemic is the inadequacy of the idea of "normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Instead of moving from one stable equilibrium to another, society is entering a "never normal" situation of continuous fluidity, flux, and turbulence, requiring constant adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

The use of war metaphors, like "war on the virus," is problematic as there is no clear enemy or finite end point in such complex situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. It is more accurate to view the virus as part of an ecology or natural living ecosystem, necessitating nature-based responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

This era reveals deep biological and moral interdependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Problems like pandemics are deeply complex and adaptive, requiring collective and integrated human and living solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. The crisis has underscored that individualistic tendencies are problematic, emphasizing the need for a stronger sense of moral relationships, particularly concerning the most vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

## Shifting Worldviews in Governance
The pandemic has made visible two competing worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>:
1.  **Control-Oriented Worldview**: Where societal structures, organization, and management models assumed control and expected political decisions to provide "right answers," plans, and budgets to be strictly adhered to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. This worldview operates as if the future is knowable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:36]</a>.
2.  **Uncertainty-Facing Worldview**: Acknowledging that there are no "right answers" and that continuous learning is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. This requires emergent learning, where "best practice" constantly changes, necessitating continuous adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.

Instead of focusing on performance management, governments should shift towards [[capacity_management | capacity management]], increasing the learning capacity of public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.

## Principles for Navigating Uncertainty
### 1. Values as Lighthouses
While specific worldviews should be abandoned, core values and a clear vision of desired future outcomes should serve as stable lighthouses, guiding decisions amidst pervasive uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.

### 2. Prepare, Don't Just React
Governments need to transition from simply reacting to proactively preparing for future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. This involves using tools like scenario planning to contemplate different versions of the future and question underlying assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>. It also requires acknowledging that sometimes the "unthinkable" future is merely "unpalatable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>.

### 3. [[future_oriented_governance | Future-Oriented Governance]] and [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]]
Countries like Finland have a long tradition of future work in government and parliament, utilizing future scenarios to inform decision-making today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. The next step is to integrate this [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory governance]] approach more strongly into mainstream political discussions and decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:12]</a>.

### 4. Embrace System-Level Thinking
Challenges like pandemics, climate change, and biodiversity loss are global, complex, and deeply systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. This requires transforming entire systems (e.g., production, mobility, energy, food, education, health) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Such transformations cut across policy areas, demanding a [[systems_thinking_and_anticipatory_innovation_governance | whole-of-government approach]] with strong leadership to shift culture, behavior, and work practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

The focus should be on building relationships between different actors across government layers, public, private, and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>. Governments need to become ecosystem stewards, facilitators of multiple interests, and conveners of different parties, acting as platforms to aggregate interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>.

### 5. Shift from Performance to Capacity Management
Moving from a narrow focus on performance to building capacity is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:03:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This involves:
*   **Resilience Mindset**: Moving from optimization (pairing resources down) to resilience (having ramp-up capacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   **Qualitative over Quantitative**: Focusing on qualitative indicators and ethnographic stories alongside quantitative data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **Outcomes over Output**: Prioritizing the ultimate outcomes rather than just immediate outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Exponential over Linear**: Recognizing that small inputs can have profound, non-linear effects at a system level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Abundance/Growth Mindsets**: Believing in the ability to learn, change, and improve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Iterative Work**: Embracing continuous adjustment and experimentation, recognizing that solutions may not be perfect immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **Integration over Silos**: Allowing for local sub-optimization if it leads to better global outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

## Leadership and [[citizen_engagement_and_trust_in_uncertain_times | Citizen Engagement and Trust]]
### 1. Courageous Leadership
Leaders in uncertain times need to balance different tensions simultaneously: present and future, micro and macro, short-term and long-term, slowing down and speeding up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This "polarity-based thinking" allows leaders to toggle between competing priorities and see their mutual reinforcement over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. It requires the intelligence to hold opposing thoughts and continue to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

A courageous approach involves openly communicating that decisions may change as new evidence emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. Trust does not mean sticking to a statement forever but adapting and learning in changing circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

### 2. Fostering Trust through Co-Creation
To build [[citizen_engagement_and_trust_in_uncertain_times | citizen trust]] in experimental government approaches, the principle "people buy into what they help create" is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. This calls for [[citizen_engagement_and_trust_in_uncertain_times | participatory government]], not populist government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Governments should facilitate dialogue, bring different interests together, and enable co-creation of principles and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

Cities often lead in this [[citizen_engagement_and_trust_in_uncertain_times | co-creation]] through place-based processes, creating tangible results that are crucial for transformations in food or mobility systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. It's important to connect these local efforts with national and international layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Citizens are often underestimated in their ability to engage with complex issues in deliberative dialogues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### 3. Enabling Behavioural Change through Learning
To encourage citizens to behave differently, traditional methods of power/authority/legislation or rational persuasion are often ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. A third, more effective model is learning, which enables citizens to create their own experience of how things can be done differently, fostering internal motivation for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. Special attention must be paid to the most vulnerable, ensuring their voices are heard and involved in addressing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

## Leveraging Crisis for Transformation
Current investments in response to the pandemic should be wise, used to transform entire systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. This represents the biggest opportunity for value creation since the first industrial revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. Governments have a role in shaping markets and creating opportunities for transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. This includes using risk-managed regulatory explorative work, like "sandboxes," as an important tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

[[emerging_technologies_in_governance | Key enabling technologies]] are already available for these transformations, even if not fully mature, and their application needs to be optimized for desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Investing in research and innovation, including digital infrastructure, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

The focus should be on the regeneration of the economy and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. This requires critical discussions about how value is defined, as current structures significantly impact the ability to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### Conclusion
The core commitments for effective [[government_role_in_managing_uncertainty_and_complexity | government role in managing uncertainty and complexity]] are:
*   Understanding the differential effects of policies, particularly on the most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   Creating a sense of planetary urgency to re-evaluate risks and proactively shape the future, not just react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   Building high-quality relationships and capabilities for co-creation across all actors in the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
*   Focusing on building quality relationships between stakeholders (e.g., family and school in education) as essential for effective outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

The path forward emphasizes the ability to learn, a sense of urgency for action, and the shaping of quality relationships across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. This provides a framework for [[future_engagement_and_uncertainty_management | future engagement and uncertainty management]].

[[Mission oriented innovation | Mission oriented innovation]] (MOI) refers to a policy approach where governments direct economic growth towards specific, clearly defined societal challenges rather than merely correcting market failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:28">[03:38:28]</a>. This approach aims to shape markets and direct the economy towards desired outcomes, such as more equitable and green societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:06">[03:37:06]</a>. It requires governments to welcome uncertainty, take risks, and adopt a long-term view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:04">[08:02:04]</a>.

## Background and Purpose

The concept of `[[missionoriented_innovation | Mission oriented innovation]]` has gained traction, particularly since 2020, as governments recognized their power to quickly deliver recovery plans and coordinate efforts around shared goals, especially in response to crises like COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. MOI provides a new policy framework to reorganize policymaking, moving away from siloed government departments to encourage collaboration among public and private sectors towards a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose (IIPP) collaborate to advance theoretical knowledge and practical implementation of `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This collaboration aims to learn from emerging practices and develop learning communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:00">[40:19:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of Effective Missions

Based on a European Commission report co-authored by Mariana Mazzucato, five key criteria for missions are:
*   **Inspirational** Missions should motivate and be understandable to wider audiences and citizens, not just be abstract percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.
*   **Clear and Targeted** While inspirational, missions must also have clear and measurable targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.
*   **Inclusive of Research and Innovation** Missions should involve investment into research and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sectoral and Cross-Disciplinary** Missions should not be limited to specific technologies or sectors but include behavioral aspects (e.g., how people eat, commute, dress) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. They should demand something from more than one sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>.
*   **Support Multiple Solutions** Governments should not dictate a single solution but enable a space for multiple actors (private sector, universities, NGOs) to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

### ROAR Framework
The ROAR framework helps gather key issues into a policy framework with four elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>:
1.  **Directionality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>: Defining the specific direction for economic growth or policies.
2.  **Organizational Capabilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>: Building public organizations capable of moving beyond traditional grant-giving towards being innovative themselves.
3.  **Assessment and Evaluation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>: Developing new methodologies to evaluate outcomes that create new markets, going beyond simple cost-benefit analyses.
4.  **Risks and Rewards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>: Addressing who invests and who benefits from the `[[missionoriented_innovation | mission]]`'s outcomes, particularly highlighted by events like the race for COVID-19 vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.

## Operationalizing Missions

OPSI's primary interest is in making `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]` operational and accessible to civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. This includes developing solid, context-aware methodologies for mission setting and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. The "mission planning canvas" is one such resource developed for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>.

### Innovation Facets Model
The Innovation Facets Model illustrates how `[[missionoriented_innovation | mission oriented innovation]]` integrates with other types of innovation that governments should support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>:
*   **Anticipatory Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>: Using futures and foresight to identify upcoming challenges that may require new high-level goals and missions.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>: Enhancing current systems to meet the demands of new `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]`.
*   **Adaptive Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>: Creating space for bottom-up, grassroots innovations that can support `[[missionoriented_innovation | mission]]` goals.

## [[mission_oriented_innovation_challenges_and_implementation | Challenges and Implementation]]

There is a growing role for `[[missionoriented_innovation | Mission oriented innovation policies]]` in member countries, but challenges remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>:
*   **Defining Missions** New policies require help in defining how `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]` work, becoming more specific over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Mission Washing"** It's crucial to avoid simply redefining current policies as `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]` or applying old tools to new goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>.
*   **Governance Redesign** `[[missionoriented_innovation | Missions]]` require a redesign of governance, particularly in terms of cross-policy and cross-ministerial approaches, as many problems transcend existing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>.

Missions are an evolving process that requires flexibility and the ability to reframe actions after initial goals and activities are set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a>. They also necessitate gaining commitment from numerous organizations and communities at multiple levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>. A key question for agencies and sectoral ministries is how to obtain the mandate and legitimacy to lead activities and networks beyond their single organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:00">[36:12:00]</a>.

## Examples of `[[missionoriented_innovation | Mission oriented innovation]]` in Practice

### Vinnova (Sweden)
Vinnova, Sweden's innovation agency, has adopted a bottom-up approach to `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]`, actively engaging citizens in workshops to define goals related to healthy and sustainable food and sustainable mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>. This includes initiatives like decarbonizing food habits by focusing on public school lunches to influence the entire food value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[25:19:00]</a>. Another example focuses on making every street livable, reducing cars, and promoting more life and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>. Vinnova aims to change the innovation agency's role from just funding to actively being more innovative, engaging citizens, and fostering bottom-up ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>.

### Spanish National Innovation Agency (CDTI)
The Spanish National Innovation Agency (CDTI) aims to become a more active agent in the innovation system by coordinating different ministries and agencies around shared goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a>. One such `[[missionoriented_innovation | mission]]` is to increase sustainable mobility while reducing aggregate mobility, making cities smaller, more compact, and less carbon-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:24:00">[30:24:00]</a>. Germany also uses `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]` similarly to coordinate ministries at federal and state levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>.

### Health Holland (Netherlands)
Health Holland's `[[missionoriented_innovation | mission]]` is for all Dutch citizens to live at least five years longer in good health by 2040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a>. This mission involves multiple sub-goals and requires a participatory experimental process across different regional contexts and domains (e.g., dementia, chronic conditions, lifestyle, social care) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>. It highlights that complex behavioral change cannot be solved by simple, one-time challenges, and requires a system approach and continuous reframing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:00">[34:58:00]</a>.

### Royal Academy of Engineering (UK)
The Royal Academy of Engineering emphasizes the importance of not overcommitting upfront to `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:24:00">[37:24:00]</a>. Instead, it suggests a flexible and dynamic approach, exploring what is possible and understanding existing capabilities that might need to be "nudged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:59:00">[37:59:00]</a>. It advocates for extreme inclusivity, building a "community of the willing," listening to underrepresented voices, and leveraging networks to avoid "lock-in effects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a>.

## Key Discussions and Emerging Questions

### Differing Perspectives on Missions
`[[missionoriented_innovation | Missions]]` can be perceived differently by various actors within the innovation chain and across different levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>. While politicians may set high-level goals, civil servants need clear, understandable missions that resonate across sectors, enabling coordination among diverse interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:41:00">[42:41:00]</a>.

### `[[missionoriented_innovation | Mission oriented policies]]` vs. Existing Policies
Unlike traditional government policies, which are often short-term and siloed due to political cycles, `[[missionoriented_innovation | mission oriented policies]]` are cross-cutting and long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:38:00">[47:38:00]</a>. They reframe policy goals to address complex, systemic problems like climate change, providing a roadmap for collaboration over extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:10:00">[48:10:00]</a>. Current government structures are largely a result of previous, often unstated, `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]` from past centuries, making the conscious adoption of `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]` necessary to build new government structures for 21st-century challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:57:00">[48:57:00]</a>.

### Role of Civil Society Organizations
`[[Missionoriented innovation | Mission oriented innovation]]` is almost impossible without significant engagement from Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:00:00">[54:00:00]</a>. Their long-term commitment helps sustain `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]` beyond political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:11:00">[54:11:00]</a>. Engaging society from the outset secures strong buy-in, crucial for ambitious policy goals that might otherwise lack public awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:24:00">[56:24:00]</a>. However, the influence of CSOs can vary depending on funding structures and political contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:16:00">[55:16:00]</a>.

### Balancing Ambition and Achievability
Designing `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]` that are both brave and realistic is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. It requires:
*   **Analytical and Engagement Tools** Bringing diverse perspectives to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.

*   **Cross-Sectoral Mindset** Ambitious missions typically span multiple sectors, challenging the status quo and initial discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

While high ambition is desirable, realistic ambition focuses on the ability to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>. It's crucial to analyze existing capabilities, capacities, and tools, and then build or acquire those that are lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.

### Anticipatory Regulation
Anticipatory regulation plays a role in `[[missionoriented_innovation | mission]]` setting and gaining stakeholder commitment, especially in public sectors often limited by rigid rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. Regulatory frameworks should allow for experimentation, trials, and flexible forms of formatting, anticipating new problems and supporting dynamic `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>. Regulators themselves need to be agile and anticipatory to avoid becoming roadblocks to `[[missionoriented_innovation | mission]]` fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.

### Fighting Internal Resistance in Public Organizations
Overcoming internal resistance in bureaucracies involves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>:
*   **Demonstrating Success** Showing examples of `[[missionoriented_innovation | mission oriented approaches]]` that have worked and led to better outcomes or improved organizational reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>.
*   **Introducing New Tools** Incorporating tools from strategic design or other fields not typically used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **Opening Up Bureaucracy** Bringing in civic movements and civil society to generate dynamics and a need for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>.
*   **Building Support Structures** Creating environments that allow for experimentation, design, trial and error, and demonstrating proof of concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.
*   **Addressing Feedback Systems** Recognizing that resistance often stems from rational fears of punishment for taking ambitious goals without sufficient resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>.
*   **Managing Turnover** Acknowledging that significant organizational change might lead to employee turnover, requiring proactive capacity building and training for new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>.

## Conclusion
`[[Mission oriented innovation | Missions]]` are transforming existing policy frameworks, prompting diverse, experimental approaches as practices continue to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:56:00">[39:56:00]</a>. The ongoing collaboration between OECD and IIPP is crucial for gathering these practices and developing learning communities to make `[[missionoriented_innovation | missions]]` workable within public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>.

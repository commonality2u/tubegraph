The COVID-19 pandemic, while having a global reach, has had "very targeted local effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">​[00:10:14]</a>. The crisis has brought concerns about "exacerbating the inequalities that are already existing in our societies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">​[00:23:57]</a>. A key aim during the pandemic is to ensure that "those who are struggling before the crisis don't come out in the other end struggling even more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">​[00:07:00]</a> and that "we're not leaving anybody behind in this in these dire times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">​[00:07:13]</a>.

## Identifying Vulnerable Groups and their Needs

Specific groups identified as vulnerable include:
*   **Youth and New Generations** These groups are significantly impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">​[00:09:52]</a>. It is important to "reach out to every part of the population not only adults but also the young ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">​[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Immigrant Communities** These communities sometimes do not receive all the necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">​[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Vulnerable Children** Safeguarding these children is a "particularly important issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">​[00:06:57]</a>.

The "needs are diverse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">​[00:11:24]</a> across these groups.

## Government Responses and Measures

Norway has focused on several strategies to support vulnerable groups during the crisis:

### Communication and Transparency
*   The central government has held press conferences several times a week when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">​[00:04:02]</a>.
*   A new initiative included press conferences directed at kids, where the Prime Minister and other ministers answered questions digitally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">​[00:04:13]</a>. This aimed to build understanding around necessary measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">​[00:04:32]</a>.
*   "People's question time" on platforms like Facebook allowed the public to ask questions directly to the Prime Minister and other ministers, which built trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">​[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Efforts have been made to reach "immigrant communities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">​[00:05:30]</a> and "religious communities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">​[00:05:48]</a> who may not follow Norwegian news in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">​[00:05:41]</a>, ensuring their leaders convey guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">​[00:05:50]</a>.

### Coordination and Local Adaptation
*   Coordination is key in national response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">​[00:06:10]</a>. Meetings with county governors and municipalities involve multiple ministers to ensure coordination across sectors affected by the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">​[00:06:33]</a>.
*   While national guidelines are provided, "local governments have the authority and the means available to adapt COVID-19 measures to the situation locally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">​[00:07:42]</a>. This adaptation is crucial because situations differ greatly across the country, from major outbreaks in cities like Oslo to municipalities with no cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">​[00:07:57]</a>.
*   Adaptation ensures public trust; if restrictions are too harsh for the local situation, trust can be lost, and similarly, if not enough is done where needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">​[00:08:24]</a>.

### Resource Allocation and Service Delivery
*   Municipalities are responsible for delivering services to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">​[00:07:27]</a>.
*   Financial support and guidance are provided to municipalities to follow up with vulnerable groups in a targeted way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">​[00:11:36]</a>.
*   It was emphasized that healthcare workers dealing with vulnerable children should not be reallocated to COVID-19 tracing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">​[00:12:01]</a>. Other personnel can be recruited for contact tracing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">​[00:12:25]</a>.
*   The public sector aims to "work as normal or as normal as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">​[00:24:51]</a> to provide security in daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">​[00:24:58]</a>.

### Balancing Approaches and Maintaining Trust
*   Decisions are based on scientific advice from health authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">​[00:09:01]</a>.
*   There is an acknowledgement of the COVID-19's "huge implications on the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">​[00:19:17]</a>, necessitating a balanced approach that also considers economic impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">​[00:09:20]</a>. Honesty about this balanced approach is seen as key to maintaining trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">​[00:09:29]</a>.
*   Maintaining public trust is crucial, as "trust is built in millimeters and it's torn down in kilometers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">​[00:27:00]</a>. Preventing inequalities from growing is essential for preserving this trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">​[00:27:15]</a>.

## Learning and Future Preparedness
The crisis has highlighted the need for better coordination and fostering the spirit of innovation observed during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">​[00:14:06]</a>. This means continuing to challenge existing ways of doing things, allowing for new ideas and even some "failure" in the public sector to drive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">​[00:19:56]</a>. The aim is to understand what the crisis has meant for societies and how to be better prepared for future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">​[00:36:10]</a>. The [[Impacts and vulnerabilities revealed by Covid19|pandemic]] has reinforced the feeling that "we are all in the same boat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">​[00:37:14]</a> and need to cooperate to solve global challenges like climate change and growing inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">​[00:36:31]</a>.

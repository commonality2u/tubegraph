The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the critical role and expectations of government, revealing new insights into [[citizen_centered_governance | citizen-centered governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A key theme emerging from global dialogues is "building back better together" and reaffirming the role of [[citizen_centered_governance | citizen-centered governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Current Landscape of Engagement

A poll conducted during the forum indicated widespread agreement on the need for increased citizen engagement:
*   **Need for Engagement:** 89.3% of participants believe there is a greater need to engage with citizens now than before COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.
*   **Government Engagement Since COVID-19:**
    *   18.8% reported that their government has made "great efforts" to involve citizens in COVID-19 discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.
    *   59.4% indicated engagement occurred, but "in a limited way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.
    *   21.9% stated their government has not had an opportunity to engage collaboratively with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>.

Mona Benara of Civicus notes that while there's an increase in engagement, there are also restrictions on freedoms that hinder citizen participation, such as censorship and limited access to information, impacting accountability and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.

## Government Perspectives and Adaptations

Governments are learning and adapting their approaches to [[citizen_centered_governance | citizen-centered governance]] in response to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Costa Rica's Experience
Costa Rica's Deputy Minister of National Planning and Economic Policy, Mr. Molina Rodriguez, emphasizes "building back better and together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The crisis revealed limitations in traditional service delivery to meet specific citizen expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Shared Responsibility:** Governments cannot solve all expectations alone; thus, they must boost shared responsibility frameworks, including Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Citizen Involvement:** Engaging citizens provides feedback on government performance and service delivery, and maintains support for democratic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Governments must also ensure clear communication, making complex policies understandable to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.
*   **Empowering Citizens:** Giving responsibility back to citizens has been effective, as seen in the application and oversight of public place protocols by citizens themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. This acknowledges that people want to be part of implementation and monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
*   **Addressing Digital Divide:** While remote services and online applications have been useful, barriers like digital literacy and access to technology must be addressed to ensure genuine inclusion, especially for vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. Investment should prioritize widely accessible tools like phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>.

### Scotland's Approach
Gary Gillespie, Chief Economist for the Government of Scotland, notes that while citizen participation was always a focus, COVID-19 magnified the need for deeper, quicker, and more paced engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Strong Citizen Focus:** Scotland has a National Performance Framework, which emphasizes treating all people with kindness, dignity, and compassion, and acting openly and transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. This framework, developed through citizen consultation, underpinned their COVID-19 response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Trust:** Daily press briefings led by the First Minister and senior officials explain decision rationales and impacts, which contributes to higher compliance and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The government's trust rating among citizens sits around 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Humility and Listening:** Governments must recognize they don't have all the answers and embrace humility, actively listening to citizens rather than just justifying decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. Emphasizing "lived experience" helps feed citizen realities into policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sectoral Work:** While traditional government-philanthropy interfaces exist, Scotland places more emphasis on cross-working across public services to break down silos, e.g., viewing knife crime as a public health crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

## Strengthening Engagement Practices

Jane Suiter, Director of the Institute for Media and Journalism in Dublin City University, highlights that a crisis is not the time for innovation in engagement, but rather for having resilient practices in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
*   **Diverse Engagement Methods:** While digital platforms are currently essential due to pandemic restrictions, they pose challenges for ensuring equality of voice and preventing domination by vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. Digital platforms need moderation and outreach efforts to include ordinary citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. Other methods include participatory budgeting and mini-publics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.
*   **Informed Participation:** Providing citizens with evidence before asking for their input is crucial for in-depth engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** It is vital that citizens see their input resulting in action; ignoring feedback breeds cynicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.

### Combating Misinformation
A significant challenge is competing with fake news and misinformation. Suiter's research suggests that involving citizens directly can be powerful:
*   **Citizen-Led Fact-Checking:** Randomly selected citizens can listen to a range of experts and then report back to their peers through social and traditional media. This approach, using the voice of ordinary citizens, was effective in correcting misperceptions around topics like 5G and virus origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.

## Civil Society Innovations

Civil society organizations (CSOs) have shown high agility in responding to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.
*   **Humanitarian Support:** CSOs and community-based organizations were quick to provide emergency support, reaching vulnerable and marginalized populations often overlooked by initial government priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **Safeguards Against Misinformation:** CSOs play a crucial role in finding innovative ways to campaign and raise awareness, acting as a safeguard against misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.
*   **Accountability and Transparency:** CSOs engage in monitoring the distribution of aid and services, and demand visibility regarding foreign funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.
*   **Innovation in Engagement:** CSOs have innovated by engaging more in digital spaces and customizing virtual engagement, while also leveraging community-based organizations for offline discussions to bridge the digital divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.
*   **Mindful Inclusion:** It's essential to adopt a hybrid approach to inclusion, recognizing the limitations of virtual spaces for diverse groups like women, youth, elders, rural populations, and those lacking digital access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Looking ahead, the emphasis is on sustained, meaningful engagement and partnership.
*   **Shift to Partnership:** Mona Benara argues for a radical shift from a "market approach" (governments as service providers, citizens as clients) to genuine [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | partnership and collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>. This means involving vulnerable populations and co-designing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>.
*   **Building Resilience:** The pandemic has accelerated changes in engagement and interaction, and governments should not revert to less formal or siloed methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. The focus should be on building the resilience of systems and society to respond to future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>. This requires empowering people and communities to be part of the solution, driving change from the bottom up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.
*   **Protecting Democracies:** Academics, governments, NGOs, and citizens must work together to protect democracies, especially in the face of future crises like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>. Ensuring open access to research and actively engaging in real-world applications of expertise is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.

[[missionoriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is characterized by a clear purpose for why innovation is needed, typically to solve a set challenge or societal problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It is fundamentally about purpose-driven innovation with clear goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Moonshot Example

One of the most widely recognized examples of [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] is the moonshot, the endeavor to go to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This mission had a clear, binary goal: either the moon was reached, or it wasn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The ultimate objective was to touch the ground on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

To achieve this, every component within the system, such as NASA, was specifically structured to fulfill the mission's goal of reaching the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. A significant amount of innovation occurred directly as a result of this moonshot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Furthermore, many different types of innovations emerged as [[side_effects_and_unintended_innovations_from_mission_driven_projects | side effects]] of this [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The clear goal also fostered the emergence of many new ideas connected to it, which could prove beneficial in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

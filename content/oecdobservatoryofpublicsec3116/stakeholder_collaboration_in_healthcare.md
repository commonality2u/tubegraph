## Introduction
The adoption of a more [[missionoriented_innovation_in_healthcare | mission-oriented approach]] is crucial for implementing new tools and fostering new ways of [[collaborative_efforts_in_public_health_governance | collaborating]] in healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This approach aims to align efforts on long-term challenges, overcome silos, and enable both bottom-up experimentation and strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Discussions in expert groups highlighted the importance of [[Stakeholder Engagement in Innovation | stakeholder involvement]], using common language to be more inclusive, and fostering bottom-up engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Why Collaboration is Crucial in Healthcare
Cancer has become the leading cause of death in Western Europe, and this problem is expected to grow as societies age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The inherent complexity of this issue, involving multiple parties, necessitates [[collaborative frameworks in health missions | collaborative frameworks]] with clear goals and reasonable timeframes, which a mission-oriented approach can provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

[[Missionoriented innovation in healthcare | Missions]] offer directionality, helping individuals and organizations overcome their limited scope regarding societal challenges and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Without a common direction, efforts can be sub-optimal, leading to issues like overly expensive precision cancer therapies due to lack of sustainable reimbursement models, or less accurate molecular diagnostics due to data sharing restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The mission approach facilitates joining forces, establishing a common direction, and creating shared understanding and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. It also provides a framework for integrating systemic aspects of innovation, including technology, infrastructure, behavior, and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. No single actor can solve these challenges alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

The [[Missionoriented innovation in healthcare | mission approach]] is already implicit in many health areas, such as antimicrobial resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Making this focus explicit is useful when there is technological maturity, promise for new science, and sufficient governance structures for health innovation and social systems, as well as complementary regulatory systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Cancer is an area where these elements are present, needing a push to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Key Elements of Successful Collaboration
### Broad Engagement and Co-ownership
The biggest opportunities in personalized medicine for cancer patients lie in areas where multi-sectoral knowledge, experience, and decision-making power converge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Aligning thoughts and ambitions around a mission makes [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaboration]] easier, but it also requires co-ownership of actions and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This means collaborators must take responsibility within their areas of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Overcoming Fragmentation
A key benefit of the mission approach is its potential to circumvent fragmentation in research, healthcare, and education, which has been a major problem for the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. It aims to focus research on improving outcomes for at-risk individuals and patients, covering the complete continuum from prevention to therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This also includes establishing robust infrastructure, such as comprehensive cancer centers and networks, to address inequalities and ensure access for all patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### Building Trust and Communication
Crucial ingredients for successful collaboration include:
*   Having the right, engaged people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   Fostering [[collaboration and public sector partnerships | collaboration]], trust, and a common vision among actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
*   Including a broad mix of expertise at different levels, from operational work to advisory boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   Involving patients and their relatives at all steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   Prioritizing communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

[[Stakeholder Engagement in Innovation | Stakeholders]] are committed and want to take responsibility, as seen in the "penta helix" model involving academia, healthcare, patients, authorities, and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

### Professional Alliance Management
For large-scale [[publicprivate_collaboration_in_technology_innovation | public-private partnerships]], professional alliance management is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. Researchers alone often cannot manage the complexity of such endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Successful [[Publicprivate collaboration in technology innovation | public-private partnerships]] require:
*   Full agreement and buy-in on objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.
*   A clear legal and intellectual property (IP) framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   A clear work plan to track progress and define roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
*   Professional alliance management to stay on top of the complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

Building trust is a long, hard process that requires overcoming personal egos and status to work as a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. This includes industries learning to collaborate with each other, sharing knowledge that may border on competitive product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

### Unconventional Partnerships
Sometimes, unusual partners are necessary for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. For example, identifying transport issues as a barrier to healthcare access necessitates partnerships with ministries of economy or transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. Prevention efforts may require cooperation with education systems and schools to raise awareness and improve health literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. The list of stakeholders who *are* involved is often shorter than those who *should* be involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

### Data Management and Patient Input
Key priorities for effective collaboration include:
*   Robust data management, focusing on quality, standards, access, and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
*   Utilizing patient-reported experience, outcome, and incident platforms for online monitoring and information exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
*   Integrating different stakeholders, like social care, hospitals, and primary care, into the same information field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
*   Incorporating genetic information into routine healthcare work, which requires raising awareness and engaging patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.
*   Prioritizing outcomes, ensuring that when risks are identified (e.g., via genetic testing), services and funding are in place to mitigate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.

## Challenges and Solutions
### Administrative Routines and Funding
Activities are often tied to administrative routines and annual budget cycles, which need to be addressed jointly across sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. Innovation funding is traditionally project-based and solution-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Funders need to [[Public sector innovation and collaboration | collaborate]] more closely to ensure a long-term perspective on funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. More work on health economics is needed to understand societal benefits and develop holistic, sustainable reimbursement models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

### Agile Approaches and Demonstrators
An agile approach allows for adaptability within consortia over time, though it can be challenging for public funders to allocate money without clear outcome specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. The ability to work case-based and build demonstrators, rather than attempting to change the entire system at once, is crucial for efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

### Leadership and Transparency
Strong, benevolent leadership, coupled with communication and transparency, are crucial for effective [[Public sector innovation and collaboration | collaboration]] within consortia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>. Transparency ensures all parties are aware of each other's activities, avoiding repetition and effectively using resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. Lessons learned from health missions, such as transport solutions or inter-hospital cooperation, should be shared broadly across healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.

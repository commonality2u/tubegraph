User-centricity is a critical skill area in public sector innovation, focusing on placing the actual end-user at the core of what government services and policies do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. It is increasingly gaining traction, with many discussions around [[Humancentered design in public services | human-centered design in government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

## Shifting Focus: From Process to People

Traditionally, governments have focused on making their internal processes more efficient, often without fully considering how these changes impact the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Embracing user-centricity shifts this paradigm by using the citizen's perspective as the guiding principle, leading to different conversations and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

When users are actively involved in the co-design process, it helps to dismantle the traditional separation between policy development and implementation, which often operate in silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. This direct engagement ensures that frontline experiences, which typically inform implementation, can directly influence policy decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

## The Innovation Lifecycle and User-Centricity

User-centricity is integral to the innovation lifecycle, particularly in the crucial stage of problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. The "Double Diamond" design methodology illustrates this, emphasizing the importance of thoroughly discovering and defining the problem *before* moving to ideate and find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

However, a common challenge in the public sector is that public servants often skip the initial problem framing stage, either by being given a pre-defined solution or by jumping directly to implementation without fully understanding the underlying problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. This solution-focused mindset can lead to disappointment and a lack of expected impact, as the true problem may never be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

The process is iterative; continually receiving feedback and information is crucial to evaluate whether the problem and situation are truly understood. This feedback informs whether solutions need tweaking or if a complete re-innovation is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

## Practical Application: Reframing Problems

A powerful example of applying user-centric principles is the GE MRI machine redesign for children. Initially, engineers developed a technically superior MRI machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. However, complaints from hospitals revealed that 80% of child patients needed sedation due to terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Instead of framing the problem as a design or technology failure, GE reframed it around the *experience* of using the MRI machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

The solution involved technicians telling children stories that incorporated the machine's noises, turning the intimidating experience into an adventure (e.g., pirate ships, outer space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This simple, inexpensive change—just a few hundred dollars in paint and script development—reduced sedation rates from 80% to under 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This demonstrates how reframing a problem from a user's perspective can lead to highly impactful, yet often simple, solutions.

## Integrating User-Centricity and Implementation

While many tools are focused on designing, effective innovation requires a strong emphasis on [[Implementing innovative ideas | implementation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) has compiled a meta-toolkit of various tools used in public and private sectors, many of which cover the implementation aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. The goal is to help match organizational needs with the right toolkit, though this is still in early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.

Ultimately, successful public sector innovation, including user-centric design, hinges on turning innovation into the "new normal" where it is embedded into the way work is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. This also involves [[Prototype development in civic innovation | prototyping]], experimenting, and iterating quickly and cheaply to gather feedback and achieve better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. While the public sector often prefers lengthy analysis before implementation, the reality is that such long-term plans are often ineffective, leading to costly failures without truly solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.

The approach should be to test multiple potential solutions quickly and cheaply, learning from both successes and failures to make more informed, larger investments that have a higher chance of success and deliver results faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.

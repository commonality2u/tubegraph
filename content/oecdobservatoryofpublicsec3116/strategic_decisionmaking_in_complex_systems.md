Strategic decision-making in complex systems, particularly within the public sector, requires a shift from traditional planning tools to more adaptive and systemic approaches. Global crises and their ripple effects have highlighted significant gaps, demonstrating the need for different types of innovation that work more systemically and for public sector organizations to shape these efforts within broader ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Challenge of Complexity and Uncertainty

Traditional planning tools, designed for a predictable world, have been exposed during periods of crisis like pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Public sector returns of impact are notoriously difficult to measure and evaluate compared to the private sector's clear financial bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The challenges faced by public sector bodies, such as climate change, are characterized by extreme [[complexity_in_governance | complexity]] and urgency, leading to significant uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In such environments, portfolio approaches emerge as effective mechanisms for handling this uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

A common understanding is that "everything is connected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. This recognition of [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | complexity]] and uncertainty in addressing change, coupled with the need to look for relationships and combinations among diverse initiatives, are considered critical facilitating elements for successful portfolio approaches to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Keeping options open to iterate and learn is also vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Innovation Portfolio Approaches in the Public Sector

Unlike private sector innovation portfolios, which typically focus on a single financial bottom line, public sector portfolios deal with a diverse "public value" bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Risk in the public sector extends beyond fiduciary concerns to programmatic and reputational risks, influenced by "organizational dark matter" such as habits and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. Therefore, [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | complexity-informed approaches]] are essential for public sector portfolio management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation uses an "innovation facet model" that distinguishes purposes of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>:
*   **Directed, mission-oriented innovation:** Addressing societal-level challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation:** Detecting and shaping emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation:** Generating bottom-up solutions through experimentation and openness to external drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation:** Focusing on efficiencies and continuous improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

The practice of innovation portfolio management is still emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Key insights from research include:
*   **Collective Mapping:** The act of collectively mapping a portfolio generates insights and collective intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Action-Oriented:** Mapping alone is insufficient; it must prompt collective interrogation and direction setting, leading to action rather than just a visual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Sustained Activity:** Portfolio mapping and direction setting must be a sustained activity with dedicated capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Human Element and Ecosystem Role:** Portfolios are managed by humans within organizations with their own interests. To drive innovation systemically, the public sector's role in an ecosystem of actors must be clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Key Elements of Effective Portfolio Approaches

### Coherence and Intent
An effective portfolio approach requires a coherence between the problem and the solution, especially when tackling large-scale, structural societal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. Instead of focusing on specific objectives, it emphasizes agreeing on a common **intent** and a shared vision for transformation, acknowledging that the precise destination may be unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. This requires patience and time (e.g., 12-18 months, or even three years) to build a shared commitment to learning by doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

### Systems Thinking and Interdependencies
Portfolio approaches explicitly work with [[systems_thinking_in_policymaking | systemic thinking]] to address complex adaptive systems challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. This involves understanding and thinking in terms of dependencies and interdependencies across various systems (social, economic, infrastructure, environmental) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

### Visual and Contextual Frameworks
Creating a visual, contextual, and systemic framework is crucial to help stakeholders see how diverse initiatives across different sectors (e.g., transport, community gardens, healthcare) relate within a larger whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>. This framework helps identify gaps and opportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>. It requires a deliberate effort to resist the "gravitational pull" to immediately jump to solutions and deliverables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

### Flexibility and Learning
A portfolio approach deliberately builds "budgets of flexibility" to create spaces for possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. It legitimizes the idea that [[complexity_in_governance | complexity]] is a feature, not a bug, and can unleash greater possibilities for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. This fosters a learning environment where many programs can meet, and participants can integrate their own objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

### Sense-Making and Actionable Intelligence
The portfolio truly comes to life when combined with rigorous sense-making, extracting learning from the experience of multiple initiatives held as one body of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. This requires a systematic practice of interrogating, reflecting, and turning insights into narratives and anecdotes that inform actionable intelligence for policy makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. This direct connection between innovation on the ground and public sector decision-making helps build confidence and encourages transversal collaboration across sectors and departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.

## Financing Innovation Portfolios

One of the "rawest edges" of implementing portfolio approaches is finding suitable funding models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. Both public and private funding tend to be geared towards individual projects with clearly defined deliverables, which often leads to incremental work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. This structural challenge is exacerbated by demands for accountability, which can push towards more restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>.

Key challenges for financing portfolios include:
*   **Pooling Funds:** Difficulty in technically structuring the pooling of funds from multiple ministries or sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.
*   **Imperfect Solutions:** Portfolios fund inherently imperfect solutions to accelerate learning, rather than seeking a single "bankable asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Time Perspective:** The longer-term perspective required for portfolio work (e.g., 2-3 years for foundational work) clashes with traditional funding cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.

Despite these challenges, a well-structured portfolio can help unlock finance by demonstrating a robust heuristic for impact. This involves structuring investment vehicles that enable investment "in the portfolio itself" â€“ meaning in its capacity to induce effects and identify follow-through possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. Examples include combining recovery funds, structural funds, and philanthropic capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.

Measuring the impact of [[strategic_foresight_tools_and_methods | strategic foresight]] in decision-making through qualitative outcomes, learning, and narratives is crucial for legitimizing diverse funding approaches like match funding or crowdfunding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Gathering "stories" and "experiences" from those impacted, rather than just formal surveys, provides a "warm understanding" of problems and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. The focus shifts from being merely "representative" to being "relevant" to the specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.

## The Role of the Portfolio Manager/Steward

The role of a portfolio manager in the public sector is distinct from that of a project manager. A project manager typically follows a strict plan with defined outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. In contrast, a portfolio manager acts as a "gardener," "orchestrator," or "editor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>. Their responsibility is to combine and connect diverse elements, understand what makes sense together, and manage the "editorial line" to ensure coherence and quality of outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>.

This role involves:
*   **Differentiating Objectives from Intent:** Helping the organization move beyond defining immediate, measurable objectives to establishing broader, shared intents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>.
*   **Identity Shift:** Recognizing that the organization is no longer solely a "solution provider" but rather a facilitator or enabler within a complex system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.
*   **Social Process:** Creating a space for discussion and building shared mental models that can adapt to unexpected changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.

A common challenge in administrations is the creation of "innovation units" tasked with changing others but with limited willingness to challenge their own ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>. This often stems from deeply ingrained organizational cultures and roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. One solution is to create "bridge" labs or entities that collaborate with public administrations but also connect with citizens and other external perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. These spaces facilitate conversations between different cultures, ensuring that engagement is productive and focused on practical next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

## Ecosystem Approaches and the Public Body's Role

For society-wide challenges, unilateral action by a single lab or administration is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>. Governments, as representations of how society is structured, need to enable public bodies to embrace their roles within ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:45">[01:09:45]</a>. This includes acting as:
*   **Challenge Owners:** Holding accountability over political cycles and generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>.
*   **Orchestrators:** Proficiently joining dots, bridging, convening, and facilitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>.
*   **Activists and Advocates:** Braiding together diverse interests for whole [[systems_thinking_in_policymaking | systems change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>.

This necessitates:
*   **Radical Collaboration:** Designing for and rewarding explicit "radical collaboration" within and across public bodies, and across different decision-making frames (local, regional, national) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>.
*   **Technology for Relationships:** Utilizing technology, especially AI, to help look across relationships and facilitate this collaboration, rather than contributing to siloed effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.

These components are essential for the public sector to effectively steer transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

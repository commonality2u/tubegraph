**[[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | Strategic foresight]] in public policy** is crucial for governments to move from a reactive to a proactive mode of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This approach aims to anticipate and respond innovatively to emerging challenges before they fully materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. It is particularly acute given widespread events related to climate change, migration, and other rapidly developing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Instead of waiting for crises, [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | anticipatory innovation]] and governance build systems that help policymakers learn from strategic insight and test innovations on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This contributes to strengthening citizens' trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:02">[03:14:02]</a> and vice versa, as it can also strengthen the government's trust towards its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Why Strategic Foresight is Important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>

Governments face complex systems and problems that have become the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While governments have been good at reacting quickly, a reactive approach to policy setting is increasingly inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The goal is to anticipate different futures and prepare for these realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

[[Role of Foresight in Policymaking | Foresight]] knowledge should not remain in silos but must be actively used, leading to actions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This involves taking steps towards desirable futures or avoiding undesirable scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## [[Challenges of implementing foresight in public sectors | Challenges and Barriers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a>

Implementing [[Strategic foresight and innovation in government | strategic foresight]] faces several challenges:
*   **Reactive Mode** Governments often look at future issues and future work as separate exercises, setting them aside until a reaction is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Lack of Connection** There is often a missing link between intensive [[Role of Foresight in Policymaking | foresight]] work and actual political decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>.
*   **Political Engagement** Motivating and involving political decision-makers in these discussions is a particular concern, as changes involve wide social contexts and consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:28">[02:20:28]</a>.
*   **Access to Expertise** Departments may lack methodological expertise for rigorous experimentation and process expertise to navigate government systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Data Quality** Good data is essential for measuring improvements, but many parts of government lack organized or usable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.
*   **Openness to Failure** Governments often fear the risk of failure, which is inherent in experimentation, even though experimentation can reduce risk by identifying what works and what doesn't early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.
*   **Timelines** [[Anticipatory innovation and strategic foresight in public policy | Anticipatory innovation]] often yields results useful years in advance, which can conflict with immediate political demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
*   **Precedent** Doing new things is challenging in government, where precedent is powerful. Building case studies and examples of success is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion** A pervasive "risk mentality" in institutions can stifle innovation and a willingness to step out of comfort zones for necessary paradigm shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:24">[02:17:24]</a>.

## [[Strategic foresight tools and methods | Tools and Methods]]

*   **Understanding and Knowledge Building:** This involves creating continuous processes for understanding rapid developments, such as the impact of algorithms on competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. Tools like technology briefs that explain technologies and their policy implications are useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>.
*   **Experimentation:** The idea is to create environments where new ways of working, technologies, and regulations can be tested under real conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>. Examples include "regulatory greenhouses" for joint testing by different actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.
*   **Iterative Policy Change:** Moving towards a more agile and stepwise approach to regulation and policy development, rather than developing legislation that quickly becomes obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.

## Case Studies and Implementation Efforts

Several countries and regions are actively working on [[integrating strategic foresight into organization and governance | integrating strategic foresight into governance]]:

### Finland
Finland is a leading country in building an [[anticipatory_innovation_and_strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | anticipatory innovation governance model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. They are working with the OECD and the European Commission to create a functional, practical, and implementable system that can serve as a blueprint elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Finland's efforts build upon changes in their strategic planning system, particularly the move to a strategic government program system implemented in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. They also leverage experience in experimentation, enabling legislation, digitalization, and ecosystemic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>. While they have experience in enhancing, mission-oriented, and adaptive innovation, the next ambition is the [[anticipatory_innovation_and_strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | anticipatory innovation system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>. A key challenge is connecting intensive [[role_of_foresight_in_policymaking | foresight]] work to actual political decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>. The next step is to raise awareness and widen the circles of people involved, possibly through specific policy area case studies where new model elements can be tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:16">[03:37:16]</a>.

### Ireland
Ireland is also at the beginning of systematically introducing [[Strategic foresight and innovation in government | strategic foresight]] into its policymaking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>. Motivated by recent crises (financial, COVID-19, climate), the public service leadership board sought to understand how the public service could be fit for purpose by 2030 and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:15">[02:52:15]</a>. They are developing a [[strategic_foresight_action_plan]] funded by the European Commission's Technical Support Institute, focusing on capacity building across the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:36">[02:54:36]</a>. The approach involves leveraging existing governance structures, like the public service leadership board, and developing an innovation strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:51">[02:59:51]</a>. A crucial insight is that a [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | foresight system]] is only relevant if its insights are linked into the policy-making system, picked up, and acted upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:30">[03:31:30]</a>. Next steps include developing a program for capacity building, delivering [[strategic_foresight_literacy training]] at senior levels, and reporting to key leadership bodies to gain support and awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:29">[03:39:29]</a>.

### Canada
Canada's federal government has had a big push to make government more experimental, with a directive for ministers to encourage this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.
*   **Definition:** Innovation is doing new things; experimentation is the process of measuring if those new things work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. The core is whether something is working or is better than previous methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>.
*   **Activities:** Building capacity through a training program, pairing experts with projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>; supporting an experimentation community of practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:23">[00:48:23]</a>; and working on systems change, including directives to experiment and annual surveys to track usage of experimental results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.
*   **Barriers:** Access to expertise (methodological and process-related) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>, data quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>, openness to failure (reframing risk as a way to minimize future failure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>, conflicting timelines (experiments are often useful long in advance, but political demands are immediate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>, and difficulty in doing new things due to powerful precedent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.

### Sweden (Komet Committee)
The Swedish government's Komet Committee aims to advance [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | anticipatory innovation]] and technology development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>. Their overarching ambition is to increase speed towards Agenda 2030 sustainability goals and ensure responsibility for innovation and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>.
*   **Model:** Their model consists of three parts: understanding, testing, and changing governance/policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.
*   **Understanding:** This involves creating continuous processes for understanding rapid developments, requiring employees to understand new technologies like AI and blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.
*   **Testing (Regulatory Greenhouses):** Instead of regulatory sandboxes, Sweden uses "regulatory greenhouses" where different actors (agencies, companies, civil servants, civil society) can jointly test new things transparently and under real conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.
*   **Changing Policy:** Moving towards a more agile and stepwise approach to regulation, starting with understanding, then setting standards, agreements, and finally legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.
*   **Key Levers:** Emphasizes [[collaborative_approaches_in_foresight | collaboration]] and building capabilities in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. It's a "culture journey," not a revolution, expecting a process of several decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

### Basque Country (Gipuzkoa)
The Gipuzkoa region is connecting [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | anticipatory governance frameworks]] to a specific mission: accelerating the transition towards a more sustainable economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.
*   **Distinction:** They distinguish between traditional [[Role of Foresight in Policymaking | foresight]] (expert analysis) and [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | anticipatory innovation]], which combines traditional [[Role of Foresight in Policymaking | foresight]] with a portfolio approach incorporating strong social and cultural initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>.
*   **Process:** They put effort into listening to social and cultural dynamics, combining this with expert analysis to build sense-making capabilities at different levels of action (public sector, community, regulation, startups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.
*   **Goal:** To generate infrastructure (social, political, public, and private) that can produce more innovative responses to emerging problems, rather than merely predicting what will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.

### Norway
Norway is working on developing "seamless public services" across seven prioritized life events, which requires both systemic innovation and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>.
*   **Mandate:** The digital strategy aims for a more efficient public sector, value creation, and a simpler everyday life through digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>.
*   **Approach:** They offer [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | foresight]] and [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | anticipatory innovation]] methodology and services, updating a "driving force document" impacting the public sector towards 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>.
*   **Integration:** An example is the "starting and managing a voluntary organization" life event, which combines [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | foresight]] and a missions approach. They establish understanding of the sector while exploring the future through scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>. This long view helps establish a more short-term mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.
*   **Cross-Silo Work:** To work across government silos, scenario planning helps create a common platform and perspective, allowing diverse representatives to discuss future driving forces and uncertainties, leading to aligned solutions and reduced strategic blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:32">[01:22:32]</a>.

## Expert Perspectives

### Leon Furth & Sheila Ronis (Ohio State University)
Their "Project on [[Role of Foresight in Policymaking | Foresight]] and Democracy" aimed to enhance civil discourse in the US by buttressing it against hyper-partisanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:25">[01:42:25]</a>.
*   **Methodology:** The "roundtable process" involves an advisory panel of future analysts and a diverse panel of experienced individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:46">[01:42:46]</a>. They identify highly disruptive longer-range trends (e.g., advanced AI, synthetic biology, climate change, demographic shifts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:10">[01:43:10]</a>.
*   **Key Idea:** It's about teaching methods for thinking better, rather than telling people what to think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:24">[01:45:24]</a>. This approach encourages students to escape ideology and develop a more fluid view of events in a democracy seen as a complex adaptive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">[01:46:50]</a>.
*   **Paradigm Shifts:** To anticipate paradigm shifts, seek out individuals who think beyond normal confines and provide them a protected space to express their ideas, even if they seem "ridiculous but ultimately true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>. Reading science fiction can also inspire imagination about distant futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:26">[02:09:26]</a>.
*   **Global Need:** [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | Anticipatory governance]] is needed at the global level for challenges individual nations cannot resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>. Decisions made today can influence realities thousands of years into the future (e.g., nuclear waste, carbon storage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:08">[01:49:08]</a>.

### Riel Miller (UNESCO)
Miller emphasizes that humanity's preemptive, colonizing, superior position to the world, reflected in hierarchical command-and-control governance systems, is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:10">[01:54:10]</a>.
*   **Critique:** Improving existing systems may not be enough; fundamental transformation is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:29">[01:54:29]</a>. The continuous reproduction of past patterns and the pursuit of immortality by institutions are fatal to the species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Paradigm Shifts:** Paradigm shifts are emergent properties of the universe and happen without our "guessing" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:06">[02:15:06]</a>. The focus should be on acting ethically in the present and embracing change as a fundamental way of functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:16">[02:15:16]</a>.
*   **Futures Literacy:** Anticipation is fundamental to life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>. Becoming better at diverse forms of anticipation requires a disciplinary foundation and a theory of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:03">[01:58:03]</a>.
*   **Key Lever:** Granting "permission to empower the people who are actually dealing with the problem" to envision their own future and define their own problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:01">[02:21:01]</a>.

### Fabiana Scopolla (European Commission, Joint Research Centre)
Scopolla highlights the challenge of dealing with "complex and ambiguous" challenges where traditional policymaking processes may be insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:57">[02:00:57]</a>.
*   **Reflection:** Policy-making often uses a "product/service approach" for simple issues but struggles with complex ones like the "Farm to Fork" strategy, which requires new economic concepts and completely different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:16">[02:00:16]</a>.
*   **Critique:** Institutions are often not ready to take the risk or leave their comfort zone to embrace necessary paradigm shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:52">[02:16:52]</a>. The prevailing "risk mentality" and emphasis on risk assessment can stifle innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:28">[02:17:28]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Developing multi-disciplinary approaches that include diverse backgrounds (designers, ethnographers, policymakers) to co-create policy and involve stakeholders from the very beginning of issue framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:57">[02:02:57]</a>.
*   **Key Levers:** Emphasizes [[collaborative_approaches_in_foresight | collaboration]], co-creation, and co-design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:59">[02:21:59]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Anticipatory innovation and strategic foresight in public policy | Strategic foresight]] is essential for governments to navigate an increasingly complex and uncertain future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. It moves beyond traditional, reactive policy-making to a proactive stance, fostering innovation and building resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. While challenges like risk aversion, political engagement, and data limitations exist, countries are experimenting with new models, such as integrated strategic planning, regulatory greenhouses, and cross-sectoral collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. The core lies in fostering humility, embracing a learning mindset, and empowering diverse stakeholders, including citizens, to collectively envision and shape desirable futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:13">[02:22:13]</a>. This systemic transformation aims to build adaptable and ethical governance structures that can address challenges of planetary importance, ensuring long-term well-being for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Further Work by the OECD
> The OECD is actively working on [[Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | anticipatory innovation governance]] and government missions, collaborating with countries like Finland, Ireland, Canada, Sweden, Latvia, the Basque Country, and Norway to advance these concepts and build practical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:56">[02:28:56]</a>. This includes developing scenarios for the future of public service, particularly talent management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:41">[02:27:41]</a>.

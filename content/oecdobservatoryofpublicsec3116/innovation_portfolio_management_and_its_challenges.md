[[Innovation Portfolios and Management | Innovation portfolio management]] is a crucial approach for stewarding innovation, particularly within the public sector, by acknowledging and strategically managing various innovation projects and programs [00:03:11]. Even if not formally recognized, organizations working with innovation inherently possess a portfolio of diverse projects and programs [00:03:43].

## Types of Innovation (OECD OPSI Facets Model)
The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) utilizes an "innovation facets model" that categorizes innovation based on its purpose [00:03:29]:
*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation** – Focused on achieving specific, agreed-upon goals [00:04:34]. These innovations are often top-down and directed towards clear objectives [00:06:18]. For example, a city's goal of becoming "climate neutral by 2030" is a political goal that drives mission-oriented innovation [00:42:50].
*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation** – Aims to improve existing systems, making them more effective, efficient, or expanding their reach [00:05:08]. This type of innovation operates within high levels of certainty, often driven by factors like austerity, cost reduction, or increased demand [00:06:46]. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) found itself very strong in this area due to its highly specialized staff [00:39:00].
*   **Adaptive Innovation** – Responds to evolving situations and new ideas emerging from the system itself [00:05:20]. This cannot be steered top-down, requiring open space for employees to experiment and explore [00:07:05]. A caregiving or welfare organization might engage in mostly adaptive innovation, responding to feedback from families [00:36:12].
*   **Anticipatory Innovation** – Prepares for fundamental shifts, new risks, uncertainties, and future developments [00:05:38]. This area involves high uncertainty and may explore ideas critical to strategic goals, requiring a different type of support [00:07:32]. NRW recognizes a need to be stronger in this space to address massive challenges like the climate and nature crises [00:39:17].

## Why Portfolio Approaches are Needed
[[Stewarding Innovation Portfolios | Stewarding innovation portfolios]] is essential because organizations often have an informal portfolio without consciously managing it [00:25:39]. Understanding the purpose of public sector innovation involves looking at how it can be directed and the level of certainty connected to it, which influences how innovation is stewarded [00:06:00].

## Key Elements of Effective [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | Innovation Portfolio Management]]
Effective [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation portfolio management]] in the public sector involves several critical aspects:
*   **Sense-Making**: Understanding what types of innovations an organization is working on [00:09:03].
*   **Assigned Stewardship**: Designating someone responsible for interpreting information and making decisions based on the portfolio [00:09:10]. This individual or team must dedicate time and space for this ongoing activity [01:01:27].
*   **Supportive Structures**: Creating environments where different types of innovation can coexist. For instance, adaptive innovation needs space, while mission-oriented innovation benefits from top-down leadership support [00:09:18].
*   **Resource Allocation, Monitoring, and Evaluation**: Questioning how different innovations are resourced, monitored, and evaluated *across the entire portfolio*, not just individually [00:09:53]. A key aspect of [[risk management in innovation | innovation]] is accepting that single innovations can fail; the success of the overall portfolio is what matters [01:03:12].
*   **Learning and Communication**: Managing how learning and communication occur both about the portfolio and within it [01:02:21]. This also includes the ability to demonstrate performance to external stakeholders [01:03:47].
*   **Strategic Alignment**: Connecting the organization's strategic aims to its innovation portfolio to avoid lock-ins and ensure the portfolio supports broader goals [00:37:53].

## The Portfolio Exploration Tool (PET)
The OECD has developed a "Portfolio Exploration Tool" (PET) as a self-service, virtual tool to help organizations analyze their innovation context [01:03:03].

### Value and Purpose
The PET enables distributed and self-service portfolio exploration, allowing organizations to work on [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | portfolio management]] without physical presence from experts [01:11:33]. It is particularly helpful in the current era, allowing work to continue despite challenges like the coronavirus pandemic [01:12:22].

### Outputs and Functions
The tool:
*   Shows where to develop innovation capabilities [01:12:35].
*   Recommends actions based on results [01:12:38].
*   Helps explore changes over time and identify areas for intervention [01:12:43].
*   Provides individualized guidance, including a portfolio balance based on user inputs [01:32:00] and a [[innovation_portfolio_management_in_public_sector | portfolio management capability score]] [01:13:51].
*   Offers project-based mapping, showing where existing projects fit within the different innovation facets [01:14:20].
*   Generates anonymized aggregate data, providing a global, continuously updated picture of innovation trends [01:15:30].
*   Provides guidance on combined results, especially when organizational balance and support structures don't align with the project map [01:19:47].

### Levels of Analysis
The tool can be used for different levels of analysis:
*   **Individual**: To understand one's own portfolio or perspective [01:16:04].
*   **Team**: To start conversations, make a case for deeper exploration, see how a team fits into the organizational portfolio, or raise specific issues [01:16:17].
*   **Senior/Central Management**: To get a snapshot, build strategy, or assess alignment of efforts with ambitions [01:16:53].

### Development and Limitations
The PET has undergone beta testing and refinement with "super users" like Natural Resources Wales and the City of Lund [01:24:36]. It is launching at the "Government After Shock" event in November [01:17:41]. However, it's important to remember that it is "just a tool" and requires dedicated organizations and teams willing to engage in these discussions [01:17:51]. It forces conversations that may be "long overdue" [01:18:25]. The tool itself does not tell you if something is "not an innovation" or should be "kicked out of your portfolio," which requires an additional step of internal clarification [01:15:44].

## Real-World Application: Natural Resources Wales (NRW)
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is a young public body, amalgamated in 2013, with sustainable development enshrined in its legislation [00:22:31]. Its mandate includes two groundbreaking pieces of legislation: a new environment act and the Future Generations Well-being of Generations Act [00:22:48]. NRW aims to embed ecosystem thinking and deliver a new approach to environmental management [00:23:13].

### Why Innovation is Important for NRW
NRW faces major [[challenges and strategies for effective innovation portfolio | challenges]] like the climate emergency and the nature crisis, which are considered existential crises facing humanity [00:24:06]. The solutions to these problems are not yet fully embedded across the public sector, highlighting the importance of innovation [00:24:19]. NRW must balance its need to experiment with new technologies and approaches with its statutory responsibilities for regulation and enforcement, which require [[risk management in innovation | risk aversion]] [00:24:30].

### NRW's Approach to Innovation and the Tool's Impact
NRW's approach to innovation was informal at its inception [00:24:51]. They sought ready-made frameworks and approaches to make sense of their issues, leading them to the OECD's tool [00:25:31].
*   **Benefits of the Tool**: The tool provided a framework for discussions, helping to crystallize conversations [00:25:54] and widen innovation conversations across the business, as innovation is "everybody's business" for NRW [00:26:25]. It provided a robust approach for developing their portfolio [00:27:01].
*   **Portfolio Balance**: NRW's assessment showed they are very strong in the enhancement space but need to be stronger in the anticipatory space [00:39:00]. This imbalance is due to the radical solutions needed for climate change and nature collapse [00:39:24]. It also highlighted the argument for using the tool within different divisions due to varied remits [00:40:17].
*   [[Challenges and Strategies for Effective Innovation Portfolio | Challenges]]: Luke Meggs noted that the tool helped highlight where things were "going wrong," specifically concerning their innovation fund. Projects with a stronger core of innovation often failed to progress due to bureaucratic public service approaches related to transparency, clarity, and internal IT processes [00:55:51]. A key challenge is selling the idea of innovation as a core competency [00:56:42]. Holly Butterworth added that getting a common understanding of what "innovation" means across a large, diverse organization is a major hurdle [01:14:59].

## Real-World Application: City of Lund, Sweden
Lund is a university city in southern Sweden, accustomed to being close to innovation due to its old university and major research facilities being built there [00:29:48]. This impending "super storm" of innovation prompted the city to learn how to deal with the impact [00:30:28].

### Why Innovation is Important for Lund
As a city authority, Lund's main challenge is creating awareness of how to use the potential of innovation within a city government, which traditionally focuses on stable service delivery [00:31:00]. They need to learn how to talk about innovation and collaborate with external partners effectively [00:31:16].

### Lund's Approach to Innovation and the Tool's Impact
Lund adopted a portfolio thinking approach to structure their efforts, combine them with other models like multi-stakeholder governance, and understand how everything works together [00:32:28].
*   **Benefits of the Tool**: The tool has been "really helpful" for having structured conversations about their portfolio [00:33:21]. It helped them identify that enhancement and anticipatory areas were not traditionally considered "innovations" and lacked specific goals or resources, despite being a large part of city work [00:42:27]. This visualization allows them to negotiate different needs and fit various projects together [00:43:32]. It provides a concrete "starting point" for discussions, preventing endless, unproductive ideation [00:46:53].
*   [[Challenges in implementing innovation | Challenges]]: Katarina Scott highlighted the risk of "management" turning innovation into rigid, bureaucratic processes focused on rules and transparency, which can stifle the entrepreneurial nature of innovation [01:06:04]. The key is to blend systematic approaches with "people relations" and find "champions" who will drive innovation despite obstacles [01:07:00].
*   [[Overcoming innovation challenges | Strategies for Portfolio Management Capability]]:
    *   **Facilitator Role**: Someone needs to be a "neutral person or entity" that acts as a facilitator, negotiating between different areas and external partners [01:08:12]. This involves staying in an "unclaimed space" and working until a fit is found [01:09:09].
    *   **Patience**: Real portfolio management takes time, with examples of projects taking years to mature from initial ideas to full implementation [01:10:01].
    *   **Strength-Based Approach**: Focus on what's good, what's happening, and tell "great stories of all your successes" [01:11:14]. Avoid focusing on problems, as "no one wants to be a problem" [01:11:27]. This positive approach helps overcome the inherent conflict between being a "rule maker" (city authority) and fostering innovation [01:11:44].

## Discussions on Portfolio Balance and Synergies
[[Innovation Portfolios and Management | Portfolio balance]] doesn't mean having an equal number of projects or funding across all innovation types [00:35:42]. Instead, it's about aligning the portfolio with the organization's strategic aims [00:37:53]. For example, a caregiving organization's portfolio might be heavily adaptive, while a space agency's might be highly anticipatory or mission-oriented [00:36:12].

The PET helps identify [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | synergies between different innovation projects]] by providing a visualization and guiding questions that facilitate conversations [00:52:07]. These discussions can reveal not only synergies but also "discords," which might be intentional to question existing missions or foster disruptive change [00:52:19]. Organizations can leverage the political legitimacy of mission-oriented projects to create space and build capacity for more questioning or novel approaches [00:53:48]. The tool also helps in a "sense-making" element by understanding where innovation is happening in the first place, allowing for later conversations about synergies [00:54:49].

## Discussions on [[Innovation Portfolio Management in Public Sector | Portfolio Management Capability]]
[[Innovation Portfolio Management in Public Sector | Portfolio management capability]] involves an ongoing activity where someone is responsible for collecting and making sense of innovation information [01:01:06]. This responsibility can reside at different levels, such as a city, ministry, or even a team [00:59:05].

A key challenge is that [[challenges of funding innovation portfolios | public sector organizations]] often become project-oriented but lack occasions to steer or collectively analyze their innovation projects [00:48:50]. This means there's a significant gap in ensuring projects align with broader goals like climate change initiatives [00:49:16].

The capability also involves evaluating the portfolio's overall performance, recognizing that individual innovations *will* fail, but the success of the portfolio as a whole in moving towards strategic goals or avoiding undesirable futures indicates good performance [01:02:40]. Communication and partnerships, both internal and external (e.g., with private sector or NGOs), are crucial for effective portfolio management, allowing organizations to analyze meeting points and incentivize shared directions [01:03:58].

Ultimately, creating the dedicated time and space to do this work is the "key starting point" for any organization to develop its [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | portfolio management capability]] [01:02:21].

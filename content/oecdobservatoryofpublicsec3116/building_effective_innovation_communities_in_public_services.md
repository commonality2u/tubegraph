Building effective innovation communities in public services is crucial for fostering inclusive societies and developing robust solutions to complex challenges. This approach emphasizes co-creating policies, services, and better futures with diverse stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This collaborative method leads to more robust solutions and greater support for decisions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Defining Co-creation in Public Services

Co-creation involves stakeholders in identifying all dimensions of a problem and designing and implementing solutions through a generative exchange of insights and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. It is distinct from merely informing stakeholders about decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> or traditional consultation practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Unlike online surveys that might collect controversial, isolated ideas, co-creation fosters a generative exchange where people come together to discuss, refine, and align their ideas for a path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Co-creation in public services can involve co-designing policies, co-constructing services, and co-experiencing and improving what has been created together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Key Elements and Examples of Co-creation

### The Importance of People and Support Networks
A recurring theme in building effective [[innovation in the public sector | public sector innovation]] communities is the critical role of "people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Skilled and motivated individuals are essential for creating inclusive and better solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Support for exchange and inspiration is vital, especially in traditionally hierarchical environments where individuals might feel isolated when trying to introduce more co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Building and strengthening connections helps individuals know whom to call for inspiration or hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

### Examples from the Field

#### Circular Plastics Alliance (European Commission)
The European Commission has engaged in participatory engagement, including co-creation, for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Ian Anderson, a participatory [[innovation in public services | innovation in public services]] advisor, helped build the Circular Plastics Alliance, aiming to recycle 10 million tons of used plastic into new products annually by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This complex problem required working with all aspects of the system simultaneously, from chemical producers to consumers and public authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

Instead of legislation, the Commission proposed an alliance, inviting members of the value chain to join and build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This involved CEOs of industry and consumer groups meeting and subsequently 14 fully participatory working group meetings in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. By September 2019, a declaration with 120 signatories was finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Meetings used classic participatory techniques like World Cafe and Open Space Technology, with everything scripted to the minute, yet participants felt complete freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This process built trust and fostered a generative exchange, leading participants to create solutions collaboratively rather than in competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, moving these processes online was straightforward for established groups due to existing trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. While informal conversations were lost, the reach to involve participants from further away increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

#### Innovative.si (Slovenian Ministry of Public Administration)
Matja Kodra leads innovative.si, a project in Slovenia focused on creatively resolving complex social challenges and providing knowledge and employee competencies for new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. The vision is to strengthen [[innovation in the public sector | innovation culture]] within public administration, a challenging task in Slovenia where top-down approaches are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

The project matches public sector challenges with facilitators to navigate co-creative problem-solving processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Public sector employees are often part of the facilitation team to learn methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Active involvement of users from the beginning is key for true [[innovation in the public sector | innovation ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

Key points of innovative.si:
*   **People are Key:** Methodologies and tools are important, but skilled and motivated people are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   **Innovation Community Platform:** Established for networking, learning, support, and transferring good practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. It hosts regular events (workshops, hackathons, design sprints) and has grown to over 400 members from public, private, and academic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   **Innovative Ambassadors:** Individuals (currently 70) who actively participate in the community and implement acquired knowledge in their work environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. They serve as entry points within their institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

#### CoGo Toolkit (European Union Horizon 2020 project)
Sanja Verbeek, a researcher, introduced the CoGo digital toolkit, developed by an international consortium to provide holistic support for public organizations implementing co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. The toolkit focuses on the service level and comprises four tools used consecutively for best results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>:
1.  **CoReady:** Helps public servants assess their organization's readiness for co-creation through a self-evaluation questionnaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. It provides an assessment score and a roadmap with ideas and best practices to improve areas of low scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. It also allows comparison with other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
2.  **CoServe:** After assessing readiness, this tool helps determine which public service is most suitable for renewal based on co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. It assesses service features and offers comparative views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.
3.  **CoNew:** Aims to actively include service users in the service renewal process, building on user journey mapping to help users discuss problems and suggest improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
4.  **CoMaster:** Allows public organizations to assess the quality of co-creation that occurred during service renewal, helping identify areas for future improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

#### Dark Matter Labs (UK)
Indy Johar, founding director of Dark Matter Labs, emphasizes that co-creation is a continuous act, not a linear process with a finished outcome, especially in complex systems where problems are continuously evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. No central authority can fully understand or control a complex system, making co-creation an informational necessity, not just a moral choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

An example is "Mind Shift," a community built to address mental health in a city in Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. Mental health is a multi-actor problem (schools, workplaces, neighborhoods) that no single agency can drive change for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>. Building this community fostered awareness of interdependencies and led to a public movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. In such contexts, politicians' role shifts from providing answers to holding space and ensuring integrity in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

## [[Challenges and strategies for innovative public services | Challenges and Strategies for Innovative Public Services]]

### Mindset and Leadership Buy-in
A major barrier to [[public sector innovation and collaboration | public sector innovation and collaboration]] is a hierarchical mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. For co-creation to succeed, political backing and clear purpose are essential, allowing participants to help define the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. It's crucial for project sponsors to be committed, have the mandate, and transparently design and implement solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. Best results are achieved when the project sponsor is from state administration, as they have the necessary mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.

### [[Innovation Skills for Public Sector | Innovation Skills for Public Sector]] and Capabilities
Another significant barrier is the lack of [[innovation_skills_for_public_sector | participatory knowledge, skills, and tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. Public officials often lack skills in listening and systemic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Holding Space vs. Control
> Indy Johar argues that "holding space" is a fundamentally different skill from traditional project management, which often recruits for control-oriented processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. This requires high levels of emotional intelligence and social presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. Therefore, it's not just about training existing staff but potentially about rebalancing capabilities through recruitment of people with this "holding space" skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
>
> Ian Anderson noted that while training helps (the European Commission has trained 3,000 officials in participatory methods), younger officials often drive processes, especially with buy-in from senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>.

### Transparency and Openness
Openness is critical for effective co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>. This means widely publishing everything, maintaining meticulous records of outcomes, and ensuring no "secret meetings" or "back door deals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. Open documentation and "working out loud" allow the process to be challenged and inputs to be factored into the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. This transparency also serves as a protection against lobbyists by allowing for mutual policing of the lobby space by all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>.

### Addressing Complexity and Legitimacy
Co-creation is the only way to deal with the increasing uncertainty and complexity of challenges faced by public sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. It facilitates sharing diverse views, findings, knowledge, and experience, crucial for creating better and more sustainable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.

When departing from traditional policymaking, constructing legitimacy is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. The "soft power" unleashed in co-creation requires careful handling, and tight scripting can help manage this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. The role of a public official is not just to host but also to provoke and challenge, ensuring the public interest is upheld even if it diverges from a community's specific interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

### Involving Diverse Voices
Co-creation requires intentional effort to include diverse voices. For instance, Antwerpen's participatory budgeting process made a concerted effort to recruit participants according to the demographic profile of the municipality, actively reaching out to immigrant communities, less educated citizens, and impoverished citizens to ensure true representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

It is also argued that stakeholders are citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. The use of citizen juries and citizen assemblies is becoming a key deliberative framework for policy co-creation, even in areas like central banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. A more profound challenge is how to involve future generations, who are often not present in current decision-making systems but will be significantly impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.

### Building Learning Communities
Co-creation is fundamentally about building a learning capacity within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. Participants are not just converting ideas but are part of a learning community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. This continuous learning experience is tremendous for both participants and the administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. In some cases, officials learned more from participants in a day of participatory work than in a year of detailed study with external consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.

## Opportunities from Crises
Crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, highlight that traditional policy-making processes are not agile or fast enough to deal with long emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. The need to implement policy, observe data, and iteratively adapt, almost through large-scale experiments, has become evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. This necessitates a fundamental rewiring of government and different ways of communicating and participating with the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>.

Despite these challenges, such periods offer an opportunity to recognize that fundamental structural changes are required, especially concerning rigid regulations, inflexible procurement, and budget planning cycles that impede agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>. A strong political consensus across political and ideological lines is needed for [[collaborative_approaches_in_public_sector_innovation | collaborative approaches in public sector innovation]] to become a standard way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.

Ultimately, building effective innovation communities in public services is about developing institutions that "care," meaning they are open to questions, outcomes, and recognize the critical role of others in delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.

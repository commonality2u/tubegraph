Effective [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | cross-border government innovation]] is increasingly vital as global challenges like climate change, digitalization, and migration transcend national borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. While governments have shown a torrent of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, these efforts are often confined to national or local boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Developing specific skills among public servants is crucial to fostering more effective cross-border cooperation.

## Challenges to Cross-Border Collaboration
Despite the clear need, several factors hinder [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | cross-border collaboration]]:

*   **Lack of Awareness and "Sex Appeal"** The term "cross-border" or "transnational" collaboration often lacks broad appeal and isn't widely discussed, leading to less public understanding of its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **"No Permission" to Look Beyond Borders** Public sector employees sometimes feel they lack the "permission" to invest time or effort in cross-border activities, as it might not align with their direct performance indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. This often requires political or senior leadership endorsement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Tribal Differences**
    *   Understanding the culture and language of "the other" is a significant hurdle in any form of cross-border cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.
    *   A "tribal" mindset can lead public servants to believe their specific work is the most important, hindering broader collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
    *   Geographic proximity often correlates with cultural proximity and trust, making collaboration easier with immediate neighbors but challenging with distant partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
*   **Funding Metrics and Institutional Barriers**
    *   Funding models can act as barriers, where treasuries might "net off" benefits generated on both sides of a border, hindering co-investment even when it's more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.
    *   Overcoming national-level resistance or lack of interest often requires finding alternative funding sources, such as through the EU, and leveraging common platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Socio-Political Trends** Globalization's tools, such as the internet and social media, paradoxically contribute to polarization rather than bringing people together, making cross-border cooperation more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. There's also a recent swing back towards nationalistic perspectives and state focus, away from cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>.

## Essential Skills for Cross-Border Collaboration

To overcome these challenges and foster effective [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] through collaboration, specific [[skills_for_the_future_in_the_public_sector | skills for the future in the public sector]] are paramount:

1.  **Relationship Building and Trust**
    *   **Knowing Your Counterpart:** Public servants need to invest in building relationships and getting to know their counterparts across borders, even when there isn't an immediate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>. This trust makes future information exchange and problem-solving much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.
    *   **Generosity:** Being generous when new establishments choose a location, rather than being "grumpy and endless," benefits the entire region in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
    *   **Personal Contact:** Human interaction and social contracts between individuals are fundamental, as "there are no algorithms that are doing it yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. This emphasizes the need for networking, especially for younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.
2.  **Problem-Solving and Adaptability**
    *   **Common Goal:** A clear, concrete, and shared mission or problem area is necessary to initiate and sustain cooperation, akin to knowing "where you want to go" before starting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
    *   **Learning from Others:** Public servants need to be ready to change how things are done, embracing new ways of working by looking elsewhere, learning from, and doing with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.
    *   **Living with Uncertainty:** Instead of avoiding it, public servants must learn to live with uncertainty, as life is "constant crisis management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. In uncertain situations, closing shop and turning inward is counterproductive; going cross-border is key to finding solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.
    *   **Local Knowledge:** The people living and dealing with the border often possess the best solutions, having already tried and tested various approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. Public servants should "talk to the border" to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.
3.  **Communication and Dialogue**
    *   **Active Listening:** A foundational skill for collaboration is actively listening to others, which leads to learning and opening doors for cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>.
    *   **Diverse Dialogue:** Engaging in dialogue with a diversity of actors—not just governments and international organizations, but also companies, NGOs, and civil society—is crucial for gathering comprehensive information and understanding impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>.

## Building Capacity and Fostering Collaboration

To equip public servants with these [[skills_for_the_future_in_the_public_sector | skills for the future in the public sector]], governments should:

*   **Grant Permission and Investment:** Senior leadership must recognize and actively support cross-border efforts, allowing staff the time and [[resources_for_skills_and_capacity_building_in_public_service | investment]] to build relationships and tackle issues beyond their immediate jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.
*   **Provide Safe Spaces for Practice:** Bringing public servants to border communities allows them to sit with residents, experience real-world issues, and practice problem-solving in a "safe place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.
*   **Develop Formalized Structures:** Establishing entities like the Nordic EGTC (European Group for Territorial Cooperation) can formalize partnerships, simplify decision-making, and facilitate funding acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. Such structures make it easier to bypass national-level resistance if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Institutionalize Collaboration:** Incorporating mandatory requirements for cooperation into laws, regulations, or international standards can make cross-border engagement a systemic reality rather than a political preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   **Recognize and Cultivate "International Identity":** Cross-border cooperation is not an innate skill but a learned one, involving developing an "internationalism" or "cross-border" identity that extends beyond local perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Education, like the School of Transnational Governance, can help instill this perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.
*   **Leverage Existing Frameworks:** Utilizing international organizations (like the WHO or UN), public banks (like the EIB), and frameworks like the EU can provide regulatory clarity and financial support, crowding in private investment for cross-border projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.

Ultimately, successful [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | public sector innovation and cross-sector collaboration]] relies on a blend of strong relationships, proactive problem-solving, and robust institutional support, enabling public servants to navigate uncertainties and deliver collective impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

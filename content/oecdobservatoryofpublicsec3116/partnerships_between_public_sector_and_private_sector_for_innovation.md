The Observatory of [[Public Sector Innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) focuses on how to embed promising practices in innovation, acting as a source of trusted advice for governments to take a deliberate and consistent approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:08">[08:05:08]</a>. This includes understanding the role of [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | public-private partnerships]] in fostering an innovative public sector.

## IP Australia's Innovation Journey

IP Australia, the Australian government agency responsible for issuing intellectual property rights (patents, trademarks, designs, and plant breeders' rights), has a long history of winning awards for innovative measures and for having a deliberate and explicit approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:28">[09:28:28]</a>. As a cost-recovered agency, IP Australia charges patent and trademark fees to fund its operations and investments, providing a significant degree of financial independence that has been a key factor in its innovation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:02">[12:22:02]</a>.

A pivotal moment in IP Australia's innovation journey was a capability review about eight years prior to the discussion, which suggested that its culture and embrace of innovation could be enhanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:30">[13:30:30]</a>. The leadership team championed an approach to embed innovation throughout the organisation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.

### Embracing Risk and Collaboration

IP Australia explicitly accepts that it will dedicate a small percentage of its budget (less than 1%) to experimentation, technology, and ideas, acknowledging that some initiatives might not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. This budget allocation supports early prototyping and agile methodologies for developing ideas in [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | collaboration]] with business areas, IT, customers, and external expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>. This approach helps in rapidly identifying both successes and concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:28:00">[31:28:00]</a>.

## Examples of Public-Private Innovations

IP Australia often leverages external expertise through commercial relationships and [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | partnerships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>.

### Trademark Search

One notable innovation is the Trademark Search tool, introduced in February 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>. This tool was developed in close [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | collaboration]] with a [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | private sector]] company in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:07">[02:59:07]</a>.
*   **Functionality:** It combined image searching and machine learning to drastically simplify trademark searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:41">[02:59:41]</a>. Instead of using text descriptions, users could upload logos for instantaneous searches against 400,000 images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:56">[02:59:56]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** The tool reduced the chance of application rejections, saved time for businesses, and provided an easier user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:13">[03:00:13]</a>. This collaborative design approach involved customers, internal technicians, and the [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | private sector]] partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:32">[03:00:32]</a>.
*   **Impact:** There was a 54% reduction in calls related to trademark searching to IP Australia's call center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:52">[03:00:52]</a>. The [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | private sector]] company that partnered with IP Australia has since partnered with similar IP offices globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:25">[03:02:25]</a>.

### Trademark Assist

Introduced in 2018, Trademark Assist is an interactive tool designed to educate and assist trademark applicants through the initial stages of the application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:40">[03:05:40]</a>.
*   **Functionality:** It tailors information to specific circumstances and uses machine learning to help applicants submit high-quality applications, allowing users to upload images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:03">[03:06:03]</a>.
*   **Impact:** Over 41,000 users have utilized the tool since its launch, leading to an increasing number of successful applications for users who apply through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:19">[03:06:19]</a>. User feedback has been overwhelmingly positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:47">[03:06:47]</a>.

## Working with the Private Sector

IP Australia's approach to working with the [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | private sector]] in these innovative, less-defined projects is grounded in taking calculated risks beyond traditional government procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:05">[35:05:05]</a>. Instead of strictly defining every possible output in a contract, the focus is on achieving desired outcomes and improving customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:00">[35:43:00]</a>.

Successful [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | collaborations]] have been characterized by:
*   **Long-term trust:** Many successful [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | partnerships]] have developed over long periods of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>.
*   **Good personal relationships:** Strong working relationships at a personal level among staff are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05:06">[37:05:06]</a>.
*   **Collaborative mindset:** IP Australia encourages its staff to view [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | private sector partners]] as collaborators rather than mere contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>.

While many [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | partnerships]] have been fruitful, some have not been as successful, primarily when the [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | partnership]] dynamics were less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:30:30">[36:30:30]</a>.

### Managing Risk in Innovation

Innovation, particularly when it involves new technologies like machine learning, carries inherent risks. IP Australia manages this by:
*   **Allocating specific funds:** Dedicating a small percentage of the budget specifically for experimentation, such as the "cognitive futures" program for AI experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>.
*   **Prototyping and Agile Development:** Using agile methodologies to build prototypes in collaboration with business areas, IT, customers, and external experts, allowing for rapid identification of issues and concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>.
*   **Leadership Acceptance of Risk:** The leadership team's willingness to accept and manage a high level of risk, even when external advisors indicate being "maxed out on risk," is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:02:00">[33:02:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

IP Australia's experience during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the benefits of prior investments in flexible workplace arrangements and IT infrastructure, which allowed for a rapid shift to remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:10:00">[38:10:00]</a>. The confidence gained from successfully adapting during the crisis reinforces the belief that the organisation can handle future uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:42:00">[43:42:00]</a>.

For individuals seeking to drive bottom-up innovation, it is important to:
*   **Understand Leadership's Concerns:** Frame proposed innovations within the context of the organisation's strategic objectives and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.
*   **Fail Fast and Be Transparent:** Be prepared for initiatives to fail, learn from them, and communicate openly about outcomes, rather than trying to hide failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.
*   **Develop Communication Skills:** Clearly articulate ideas and frame them effectively for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.
*   **Engage Stakeholders:** Do homework, talk to customers and stakeholders, and bring evidence to support proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.

Ultimately, successfully embedding an innovative outlook and practice across an entire agency takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>. It's an organic process, recognizing that different people will adapt at different paces, and requires consistent communication and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.

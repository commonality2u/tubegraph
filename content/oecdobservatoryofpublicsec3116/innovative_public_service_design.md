[[Innovative public service design]] focuses on co-creating policies, services, and better futures with stakeholders to achieve more robust solutions and greater support for decisions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This approach emphasizes practical examples and stories from the field, inviting continuous input from participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Core Concepts of Co-creation
Co-creation, in the context of [[innovative public service design]], is defined as involving stakeholders in identifying all dimensions of a problem or issue, and then designing and implementing solutions. This is facilitated through a generative exchange of insights and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

It encompasses:
*   Co-designing policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   Co-constructing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   Co-experiencing and improving what has been co-created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>

Co-creation is distinct from merely informing or consultative practices, which often result in a series of monologues rather than a generative exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. It requires people to get together, online or offline, to talk, brush off ideas, and align on a path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Examples and Case Studies

### The Circular Plastics Alliance (European Commission)
Ian Anderson, a participatory [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] advisor, led the Circular Plastics Alliance within the European Commission, which aimed to recycle 10 million tons of used plastic into new products annually by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This complex problem required working with all aspects of the system, from chemical producers to recyclers and public authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

Instead of legislation, the Commission proposed an alliance where members of the value chain declared their commitment and participated in building the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This involved CEO meetings and 14 fully participatory working group meetings in 2019, leading to a declaration signed by 120 signatories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Meetings used classic participatory techniques like World Cafe and Open Space Technology, with meticulous scripting to ensure freedom of discussion and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The process was based on building trust and fostering generative exchange to create solutions collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the alliance transitioned online smoothly due to pre-existing trust. While online formats lose informal interactions, they gain wider reach, allowing more diverse participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Innovative.si (Slovenian Public Administration)
Matia Codra from the Ministry of Public Administration of Slovenia manages "innovative.si," a project with two main goals: creatively resolving complex social challenges and building employee competencies for a different way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Their vision is to strengthen [[innovation_in_public_service_delivery | innovation]] culture within public administration, which is challenging given traditional top-down approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

The project matches public sector challenges with internal or external facilitators to navigate co-creative processes. Often, public sector employees are part of the facilitation team to learn methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Active user involvement from the beginning is crucial for true [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] ecosystems, requiring a wide range of stakeholders from end-users to policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

Key points of the initiative include:
*   **People-centric approach**: Skilled and motivated individuals are key to inclusive solutions. The project established an [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] community platform for networking, learning, support, and sharing good practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. This community uses various methods like workshops, hackathons, and design sprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   **[[innovative_public_administration_practices | Innovative Ambassadors]]**: These individuals actively participate in the community and their work environments, acting as entry points in their institutions and promoting co-creative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. They implement acquired knowledge in their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

### Co-Go Digital Toolkit
Sanja Verbeck presented the Co-Go digital toolkit, developed by an international consortium financed by the European Union's Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This toolkit provides holistic support for public organizations to implement co-creation at the service level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

It comprises four sequential tools:
1.  **Core-Ready**: Helps public servants assess their organization's readiness for co-creation through a self-evaluation questionnaire. It provides an assessment score and a roadmap with ideas and best practices to improve areas of low readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. It also allows comparison with other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.
2.  **Co-Serve**: Assists public organizations in determining which public service is most suitable for renewal through co-creation, using a questionnaire to assess service features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
3.  **Co-New**: Actively includes service users in the service renewal process, building on user journey mapping to help users identify problems and suggest improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
4.  **Co-Master**: Allows public organizations to assess the quality of co-creation during service renewal, identifying areas for future improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

## Principles and Preconditions for Successful Co-creation

### Continuous and [[Adaptive Innovation in Public Services | Adaptive Approach]]
Indy Johar argues that co-creation should be a continuous act, not a linear process, as problem domains are continuously evolving in complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. Central authority alone cannot understand and control complex systems, making co-creation the only way to deal with complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

### Legitimacy and Transparency
When deviating from traditional policymaking, legitimacy, ethics, and transparency are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. The soft power unleashed in co-creation necessitates tight scripting and open processes to prevent collusion and ensure transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. Open documentation of processes and learnings allows for public challenge and input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>.

### Learning Capacity and Community Building
Co-creation is about building a learning capacity within the system, fostering distributed learning among all partners. It creates a learning community essential for driving change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. This means continuous training programs, networking, and daily work to connect people, driven by motivation and inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.

### Political Backing and Clear Purpose
[[Principles of public sector innovation | Political backing and momentum]] are essential for clear purpose. The aim is not to define the outcome from the outset, but to clarify the problem to be solved, allowing participants to help arrive at the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. Project sponsors must be committed to designing, delivering, and implementing solutions in a co-creative manner, with the necessary mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. Strong political consensus across lines about the importance of collaborative [[innovation_in_government | innovations]] is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.

### Mindset and Skills
A key challenge is the hierarchical mindset and lack of participatory knowledge, skills, and tools in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Openness and knowledge**: To do things differently, one needs knowledge and openness to new ideas, views, and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
*   **Holding space**: This is a distinct skill, different from control-oriented project management. It requires high levels of emotional intelligence and social presence, suggesting a need for rebalancing capabilities and recruitment in departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.
*   **Listening and systemic thinking**: There is often a lack of skills in listening and systemic thinking. Problem-solving needs a holistic, challenge-based system approach, not just addressing symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.

### Timeliness and Effectiveness
While co-creation can be time-consuming initially, the subsequent implementation and public buy-in are significantly more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Engaging stakeholders early on increases support and prevents later obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. Participation is valuable in all phases of the policy cycle, especially in problem and solution definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

### Addressing Complexity
Co-creation is critical when facing increasing uncertainty and complex challenges, as it enables the sharing of different views, findings, knowledge, and experience to create better and more sustainable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. Conversely, simple problems with known solutions may not require extensive participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.

### Post-process Commitment and Communication
After co-creation, it is vital to adopt concrete commitments with clearly defined responsibilities and deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. Constant two-way communication with all involved stakeholders is key for ongoing cooperation and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.

### Institutional Readiness and Challenge
Organizations must be aware of the limits of conventional policymaking and service provision, and have a strategic intent for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>. This involves reducing silos and facilitating regular collaborative activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>. The institution itself is the "iceberg problem," requiring a rebalancing of capabilities and a commitment to openness and "care" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.

### Involving Diverse Voices
Efforts must be made to recruit participants representing the true demographic profile of a community, including often-excluded groups, to ensure everyone is represented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. Stakeholders are citizens, and processes should recognize this, potentially using citizen juries and assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

### The Role of Public Officials
Public officials in co-creation should not interpret participants' outcomes but listen and design the process clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. Beyond hosting, their role is to provoke and challenge to ensure the public interest is considered, as community interests and public interests are not always the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

### Crisis as Opportunity
Crises like the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the inadequacy of current policymaking processes, which are not agile or fast enough for long emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. Governments have had to act by continuously iterating large-scale experiments, which requires a fundamentally different policy architecture and communication with the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. This shift in policy making also raises important questions about how legitimacy is constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>.

## Challenges to Implementation
Challenges include long hard work to train older generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a> and structural difficulties such as multi-year public budget planning, which hinders agile, iterative policy processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.

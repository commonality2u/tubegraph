The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both the [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation|challenges and opportunities]] for [[Impact of innovation in the public sector|innovation in the public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The crisis underscores the need for more innovative and agile government, while also emphasizing that innovation requires a deliberate, mission-oriented, and systemic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### The Role of Public Sector Innovation in Crisis Response
The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) has been tracking innovative responses to COVID-19, collecting over 250 examples of varying scope and innovativeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This work fits into a broader examination of digital and [[Impact of innovation in the public sector|innovation]] within the public governance directorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Examples of innovative responses observed include:
*   **Structural Responses and Longer-Term Shifts**: Including climate change ambitions in airline rescue packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Solidarity Platforms**: Governments and non-government actors making it easier for people to volunteer and support their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Hackathons**: Used to develop novel ideas, some of which were quickly implemented (e.g., in Lithuania) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Service Delivery Adjustments**: Significant [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19|digital transformation]], such as virtual weddings and distant wedding registrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Responses by Legislatures**: Ensuring continued scrutiny of the executive through virtual meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Infection Control and Tracking**: Development of various apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Resources**: In Sweden, airline stewards were encouraged to take up health training to support the health network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Improved Communications**: Providing targeted information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Support for Vulnerable Groups**: New Zealand's declaration of the Easter Bunny as an essential worker for children, or Portugal's "Co for Kids" platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Opportunities for Public Sector Innovation
A crisis can be conducive to [[Impact of innovation in the public sector|innovation]] by addressing four key influencing factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>:
*   **Clarity**: The crisis clearly signals that change is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.
*   **Parity**: New options are given equal footing with existing solutions because current ones are often inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
*   **Suitability**: Investment and support for new capabilities increase rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.
*   **Normality**: Trying unusual things becomes perfectly normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

Specific opportunities highlighted by the crisis include:
*   **Digital Transformation**: A "quantum leap" in digital transformation has occurred, even from a strong starting point like Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Existing infrastructure (e.g., for remote work) was scaled up rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. This has shifted digital work habits and made previously uphill struggles (like virtual working) transformational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.
*   **Increased Legitimacy for Public Sector Innovation**: What was once seen as a luxury is now recognized as a necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. This could lead to increased innovation capacity and more radical innovation in response to other emerging crises like climate change or demographic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.
*   **Demonstration of the Innovation Ecosystem**: The crisis revealed that the [[Impact of innovation in the public sector|innovation ecosystem]] is real, with active, sometimes latent, connections between stakeholders (entrepreneurs, scientists, public administration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This fostered sharing economies, crowdsourcing, and skills transference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.
*   **Reinforcement of Open Government**: The crisis underscored the importance of trust, transparency, and reliability, showing that public government is critical and can overcome challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.
*   **Re-evaluation of Values and Services**: The crisis prompted a re-evaluation of what is considered important, leading to the reimagining of public services and national strategies (e.g., healthcare in South Africa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.
*   **Training Ground for Public Servants**: The crisis served as an "intense training ground" or "combat ground" for public servants, forcing them to adapt, improve, and customize solutions to be user-centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. It acted as a catalyst and accelerator for a paradigm shift, building on previous gradual accumulations of small changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

### Challenges for Public Sector Innovation
While enabling rapid change, a crisis also presents significant [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation|challenges]] for [[Challenges in Managing Innovation within Public Sector Organizations|managing innovation]]:
*   **Centralization of Decision-Making**: Crisis mode often entails centralization at the top of the hierarchy, potentially detaching decisions about innovative solutions from specific frontline knowledge and possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritization Shift**: Innovation work not directly related to the crisis may take a "back burner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   **Frustration and Siloization**: Specialists may "close rank," leading to a lack of synchronization between different sectors (e.g., health vs. social services), creating "smaller crises" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **Limited Tool Competency**: Many individuals, despite innovating out of necessity, may not possess the formal tools and approaches for professional innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.
*   **"Tunnel Effect" and Presentism**: The urgency of the crisis can lead to a focus solely on immediate, pragmatic solutions, ignoring other ongoing issues or long-term implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.
*   **Nostalgia for Normality**: A desire to return to the "old normal" can hinder the embrace of a necessary "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
*   **Misinformation and Coordination**: Dealing with a high volume of dispersed and sometimes unreliable information is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>. A risk exists of rushed, atomized initiatives that replicate efforts without dialogue or coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide**: Rapid digitalization of public services, while beneficial, risks further penalizing populations without internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
*   **Privacy Concerns**: The development of tracking apps raises significant concerns about surveillance and privacy, requiring public debate and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>.
*   **Risk of Reverting to Defaults**: There is a significant risk that, once the immediate crisis subsides, government systems will "default back" to old ways of doing things if not actively pushed into a new state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.

### Sustaining Innovation Beyond the Crisis
To prevent a return to the old normal and leverage crisis-driven innovations for the future, several actions are crucial:
*   **Strategic Capture and Learning**: Documenting and analyzing the "good examples" of innovation that emerged during the crisis, emphasizing stories of the "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>. This includes using evidence-based decision-making and triangulating qualitative and quantitative data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>.
*   **Socializing and Spreading Innovation**: Making successful innovations accessible and demonstrating their effectiveness to ensure their sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>.
*   **Reinvesting in the Innovation Ecosystem**: Maintaining continuous, bidirectional engagement with community, scientific, and entrepreneurial stakeholders who contributed during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.
*   **Focus on Use and Sustainability**: It's not enough to create solutions; they must be actively used and managed for long-term effectiveness, ensuring they are user-centered and inclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.
*   **Responsible Innovation**: Systematically thinking about the anticipated and unanticipated consequences of innovations, utilizing foresight and anticipatory methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.
*   **Embracing Experimentation**: Promoting an experimental approach to innovation that allows for testing, learning from failures, and improving, thereby reducing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.
*   **Shifting Governance Models**: Moving from a "command and control" model to a more "socially active" way of managing outcomes, fostering a [[Principles of public sector innovation|participatory state]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   **Institutional Capability Building**: Strengthening the ability of institutions to innovate and adapt, rather than relying solely on individual ingenuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>. This also means moving beyond "innovation theater" and focusing on practical application ("dirty hands") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>.
*   **Dialogue on the "New Normal"**: Facilitating ongoing discussions about balancing the desire to return to the "old normal," retaining successful "new prototypes," and seizing the opportunity for a radical paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:48">[01:23:48]</a>. The crisis is not over, but the beginning of something new, requiring continued dialogue and action over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:57">[01:24:57]</a>.

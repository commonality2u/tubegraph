[[Experimentation in government innovation | Experimentation]] and [[prototype_development_in_civic_innovation | policy prototyping]] are central to anticipatory innovation governance in the public sector, enabling organizations to detect, understand, and act upon future changes in their present-day work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## The Need for Experimentation

Terms like "future proof" or "future fit" only hold meaning if organizations actively work in the present to prepare for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This involves more than just better knowledge and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The future is crucial for the legitimacy of policy decisions in a democracy, facing challenges like climate change and biodiversity loss, and ensuring digital transformation is inclusive and beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

[[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | Strategic foresight]] contributes significantly to strengthening democracy, promoting public trust, addressing climate change, and preparing governments to better serve societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. The needs of the future are the work of the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

### Bridging the Impact Gap

Governments constantly consider the future, but they don't always fully utilize what they could or should know to better prepare for and shape it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. This creates an "impact gap," where extensive [[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | strategic foresight]] and anticipation work, often generated by governments and organizations like the OECD, does not translate into policy action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. [[Experimentation in government innovation | Experimentation]] helps bridge this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

### Challenging Organizational Habits and the "Myth of Best Practice"

A key challenge for public policy and [[Experimentation in government innovation | futures practice]] within government is addressing organizational habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. These habits can include:
*   **Policies and precedents:** Existing rules and routines that organizations are accustomed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>.
*   **Resistance to change:** Sticking to past methods because "that's how we always done it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.
*   **Culture and capabilities:** A social environment that might foster risk aversion or a lack of capacity within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.

These habits can hinder thinking about the future and [[innovation_models_and_methods_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>. A fundamental question in [[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | futures work]] is "what if we were wrong?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a> While every organization implicitly or explicitly thinks ahead, the difficult question for large bureaucratic organizations is to entertain the possibility that their current narrative might be incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that disruptions can lead to significant and impactful errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. The current focus is on preparedness rather than merely convincing people they might be wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.

The "myth of the best practice" is a common obstacle, especially in the public sector, where there's a tendency to rely on precedents and past policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>. This myth suggests that past methods will always work again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. However, when looking to the future, the reality is that "maybe nobody knows" the single best way forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.

## Experimentation as a Learning Process

Since knowing the future in advance is impossible and there are no ready-made answers, considering multiple alternative futures helps in making more prepared decisions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. [[Experimentation in government innovation | Experimentation]] allows for learning and evidence gathering, which is at the core of public sector [[innovation_models_and_methods_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] and effective, democratic, and sustainable public policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This process is what is meant by "anticipatory [[innovation_models_and_methods_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] governance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

[[Experimentation in government innovation | Experimentation]] involves taking in uncertainty and preventing paralysis caused by disruptions and the possibility of being wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>. The challenge is to design [[Experimentation in government innovation | experiments]] to learn together, involving collaboration between the public sector, academia, and the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. This process includes testing, observing, reflecting, and re-testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>. It requires humility and a willingness to acknowledge when things might be wrong or need changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>.

## Prototyping for Impact

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector [[innovation_models_and_methods_in_the_public_sector | Innovation]] (OPSI) develops new approaches to [[prototype_development_in_civic_innovation | prototyping]] that take [[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | strategic foresight]] work forward and embed it into national governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. The aim is to develop innovative and value-changing prototypes and [[Experimentation in government innovation | experiments]] to bridge the "impact gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. OPSI engages in collaborations with governments worldwide, including Finland, Latvia, Slovenia, Ireland, and Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Practice

The European Commission faces specific challenges in implementing [[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | foresight]] and [[Experimentation in government innovation | experimentation]]:
*   **Short-term policy pressure:** A dominant factor is the strong pressure from policy and political sides for immediate, short-term solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>. [[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | Foresight]] teams often battle the misunderstanding that their role is crisis response, when it's meant for horizon scanning and pre-emptive discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>.
*   **Culture of efficiency and quantitative focus:** The commission's culture of efficiency often aligns with a quantitative focus, creating barriers for those trying to think ahead and develop participatory approaches that include broader factors like values and changing human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. These parameters do not easily fit into quantitative models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of [[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | foresight]] literacy:** There is a significant lack of understanding regarding [[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | foresight]] within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>. Training initiatives are being implemented to improve [[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | foresight]] literacy and help colleagues become more comfortable with uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>.
*   **Daily [[Experimentation in government innovation | experimentation]]:** Despite standard methods in the [[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | foresight]] toolbox, diverse policy domains and specific requests necessitate constant [[Experimentation in government innovation | experimentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>. Every project requires combining and tweaking standard methods to adapt to specific circumstances and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.

The ultimate goal of [[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | foresight]] and [[Experimentation in government innovation | experimentation]] is to help steer outcomes towards the positive and avoid the negative, by acknowledging that uncertainty doesn't necessarily mean something bad, just that the future is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.

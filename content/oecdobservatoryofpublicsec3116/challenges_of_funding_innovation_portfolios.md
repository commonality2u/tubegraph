The practice of [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation portfolio management]] in the public sector is still emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. While the private sector typically manages innovation portfolios to balance investments or risk with a clear financial bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, the public sector's "public value" bottom line is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Public sector returns on impact are notoriously difficult to measure and evaluate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, and risk encompasses more than just fiduciary concerns, including programmatic and reputational risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.

Even though discussions about [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation portfolios]] are not exclusively about funding, finance remains a crucial aspect, as it dictates resource allocation and signals priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. A significant challenge lies in the difficulty of finding forms of innovation funding truly suited for [[innovation portfolio management and its challenges | innovation portfolio approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.

## Challenges in Funding Innovation Portfolios
When dealing with complex challenges, the ideal approach involves financing that is open to possibilities and designed for continuous discovery and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. However, several factors hinder this in the public sector:

*   **Pressure for Accountability and Restriction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>: In times of rising debt or reduced budgets (e.g., for aid assistance), there's a natural tendency to demand more accountability and impose greater restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. This makes it challenging to advocate for different types of capital with new intents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Dominance of Project Finance and Grants** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>: Existing financial instruments often limit funding to individual projects with clearly defined objectives and short-term perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. This contrasts with the longer timeframes (e.g., 2-3 years) needed for portfolio approaches to foster continuous learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   **Pushback from Stakeholders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>: Public sector counterparts, such as governments and mayors, may immediately question who will finance portfolio approaches, making it an easy way to push back against new methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
*   **Structural Barriers in Procurement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>: Public procurement structures often do not support the pooling of funds from multiple ministries, which is essential for a portfolio approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
*   **Focus on Deliverables over Learning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>: Both public and private money typically seek projects with clear, deliverable terms, which often leads to incremental work rather than the exploration of inherently imperfect solutions needed for systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>.

## Strategies and Emerging Solutions
Despite these [[Challenges in implementing innovation | challenges in implementing innovation]], there are emerging strategies and initiatives to better suit funding to [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation portfolio approaches]]:

*   **Prototyping New Systems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>: Organizations are seeking partners within government willing to prototype new financial systems and instruments, even while operating under existing constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>. For example, a blueprint for "system financing" is being tested in Vietnam to fund portfolios rather than individual projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.
*   **"Mayors for Growth" Initiative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>: An initiative in the European Union was framed from the outset to accept complexity, with funding open to continuous discovery and adaptation through a portfolio approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Transformational Capital** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>: Efforts are underway to structure investment vehicles that enable investment *into the portfolio itself* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. This means investors place money into the capacity of the portfolio to induce effects and follow through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. This approach can make it easier to unlock funding, particularly when combining sources like COVID recovery funds, structural funds, and philanthropic capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.
*   **Robust Heuristics and Impact Logic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>: Demonstrating a clear "impact logic" helps structure qualitative outcome questions and learning discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>. This involves showing how funding contributes to a nexus of inquiry, interrogation, and direct innovation-to-policy learning, addressing multiple concerns (e.g., emissions, adaptation, social cohesion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.
*   **Innovative Evaluation and Monitoring** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>: Utilizing qualitative data like narratives, stories, and anecdotes from those impacted by projects can provide a "warm understanding" of problems, opportunities, and public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. This shifts the focus from being merely "representative" to being "relevant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **Building Budgets of Flexibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>: Deliberately creating possibilities for learning and legitimizing the idea that complexity is a feature, not a bug, can help build willingness to participate and remove fears about new programs competing with old ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. This allows for many programs to converge and integrate their objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

## Conclusion
The structural challenge for portfolios remains that funding often cannot be easily pulled across different systems and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>. There is a strong call for collaboration to build different ways of structuring and recycling money back into the system to better support [[Stewarding Innovation Portfolios | stewarding innovation portfolios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>. This requires evolving from traditional planning processes to approaches that embrace adaptation and adjustment as circumstances change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) developed the OPSI Toolkit Navigator to help public sector innovators find the right [[innovation_tools_and_methods | tools and methods]] for their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This project, a public service initiative, was supported by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Challenge of "Peak Toolkit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

In 2017, OPSI recognized that the world did not need another toolkit, as hundreds already existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The goal shifted from creating a new toolkit to helping people navigate the existing "noise" and find the "signal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. As Andrea Snook from the UK Policy Lab observed, "toolkits are like toothbrushes, everybody has one, but nobody wants to use someone else's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This highlights the common desire to build something new, even when many options are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

User research with public sector leaders and civil servants in 2017 informed the development of the navigator, focusing on their journey to find information, collaborators, and [[innovation_tools_and_methods | tools and methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## OPSI's Multifaceted Innovation Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>

OPSI's model for public sector innovation identifies different purposes and approaches to innovation, stemming from system-level studies of governments like Canada and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>:
*   **Directed (Shaping/Top-down)**: Mission-oriented innovation, like putting a person on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Undirected (Responding/Bottom-up)**: Innovation for its own sake, creating space for entrepreneurial spirit to find new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented (High Certainty)**: Improving existing processes and services for better efficiency, e.g., using behavioral insights for tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Exploring (Uncertain Spaces)**: Radical shifts, examining how internal and external changes will alter the nature of government work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Each facet of innovation is supported by distinct methods, processes, and disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The choice of methods significantly biases innovation outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. For instance, heavy investment in lean business process management or behavioral insights may lead to more enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Therefore, selecting methods aligned with purpose is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Findings from Toolkit Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>

Research into hundreds of existing toolkits and user feedback from public sector innovators revealed common issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>:
*   **Over-reliance on past tools**: Using methods that worked previously, regardless of current problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Misalignment**: Toolkits chosen for their appearance or colleague's use, not alignment with the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Lack of skill consideration**: Some toolkits require advanced skills not always present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Granularity issues**: Toolkits can be either too granular or too broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Learned helplessness**: Polished toolkits can discourage adaptation, even when context demands it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Characteristics of an Ideal Toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>

Based on these findings, an ideal toolkit should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>:
*   **Adaptable and transferable**: Easily modified for different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Approachable and user-centered**: Clear and easy to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Action-oriented**: Designed to lead to concrete steps, unlike mere guidance or knowledge bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Modular**: Allowing users to combine parts from different toolkits to suit their specific problem and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Organization by "Jobs to Be Done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>

The OPSI Toolkit Navigator organizes existing toolkits by "innovation tasks" or "jobs to be done," which extend beyond typical problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>:

*   **Problem-solving jobs**: Traditional tasks like discovery and prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Group behavioral jobs**: Tasks related to team dynamics and mindset, such as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>:
    *   Building consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>
    *   Building shared understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>
    *   Converging on a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>
    *   Challenging assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>
    *   Cultivating a different mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>
    *   Breaking existing habits and rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>
*   **Approach planning jobs**: Preliminary scoping and getting started activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Contextualization jobs**: Understanding the dynamics of the working context, including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>:
    *   Visualizing a system or set of relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>
    *   Imagining different futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>

This broader view acknowledges that an innovator's work often extends beyond just solving a problem, involving group coordination, setting up collaborations, and building partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Levels of Granularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>

Toolkits can vary widely in their level of abstraction, from broad methodologies to specific techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>:
*   **Methodology**: A very abstract level, e.g., design methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Technique**: A very specific action, e.g., using paper-based forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

The navigator aims to help users find information at the right level of abstraction for their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. For example, learning about behavioral insights might require a broader method, while setting up a randomized control trial might need a detailed manual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Developing the Toolkit Navigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>

The navigator was developed through extensive analysis of hundreds of toolkits, tagging them by discipline, "jobs to be done," and other fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Initial designs were tested with public sector innovators and national government innovation leaders from various countries (e.g., Chile, Scotland, Canada, Finland, Mexico, New Zealand), who provided significant feedback to refine the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

### Building Capacity through Adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>

A key belief behind the navigator is that the best way to build innovative capacity is by building or adapting one's own toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. The navigator prioritizes freely accessible toolkits (even those requiring email for access) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a> and those easier to adapt, modify, and remix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The act of remixing and adapting content builds capacity within teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

Toolkits are assigned badges to indicate their adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>:
*   **Open Source Basic**: Allows for reuse (download, print) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Open Source Champion**: Licensed with a Creative Commons license, allowing remixing and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Heroes**: Go "above and beyond" by providing editable files or code to facilitate remixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### Social Proof and Networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>

People seeking new methods often want social proof that others have successfully used them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. The OPSI Toolkit Navigator addresses this by connecting toolkits to case studies on the OPSI website, which document hundreds of innovation cases in government with impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. It also connects to the OPSI platform's user base of over 1700 public sector innovators worldwide, fostering discussions, reviews, and peer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. This global network offers a space for innovators to [[building_networks_for_innovation | connect]] and ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

## How to Use the OPSI Toolkit Navigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>

The navigator organizes content by topics, common actions, and opportunities to [[building_networks_for_innovation | connect]] with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

### Navigation Paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>

Users can explore the navigator through various paths:

1.  **By Topic/Discipline**: Users can select a topic, such as "Digital and Technology Transformation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
    *   Each discipline has an index article providing basic principles, OECD guidance, considerations for public sector use, typical methods, and advice on choosing a toolkit in that area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
    *   Toolkit pages offer quick overviews, publisher details, links to the toolkit and editable content, related disciplines (e.g., Strategic Design), license information, country of origin, and features (e.g., checklists, type like "guidance" or "tool set") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
    *   Users can indicate if they've used or saved a toolkit to their profile for easy access and comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

2.  **By Actions/Approaches**: Users can choose an action, like "Design a new strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
    *   This leads to guidance on the approach and collections of toolkits based on specific needs, such as "toolkits intended for policymakers, practitioners, or stakeholders outside of government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
    *   Filters allow users to narrow down results based on role (e.g., policymakers) and features (e.g., including specific techniques) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

3.  **Connecting to Others**: Users can find ways to access expertise or advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
    *   Guidance covers topics like building versus buying skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
    *   Toolkits are organized by sub-tasks related to [[building_networks_for_innovation | connecting to others]], such as "team building and lab practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

### Search and Curated Collections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>

A keyword search allows users to find specific types of toolkits, like "policy innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
Curated collections address common demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>:
*   **Game-based toolkits**: Toolkits with a game component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.
*   **Highly adaptable toolkits**: Those licensed for reuse and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.
*   **Starter toolkits**: Ones with extensive guidance and text, suitable for those new to innovation practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.

## Submitting New Toolkits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>

The navigator allows users to submit new toolkits they find valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. Criteria for inclusion are:
*   Freely accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
*   Relevant to the public sector context (though not exclusively for it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   Aimed at stimulating action, not just building a body of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.

Submissions are reviewed before publication, with a default to including as many as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. The OPSI Toolkit Navigator remains a constant work in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

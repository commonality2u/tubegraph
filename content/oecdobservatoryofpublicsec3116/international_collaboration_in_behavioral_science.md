International collaboration in behavioral science has proven to be crucial, especially during times of crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of shared learning and collective action among countries to address rapidly evolving challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Benefits and Importance of Collaboration

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of cross-sector collaboration, particularly between academics and government, was remarkable and unprecedented, occurring very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. This collaborative spirit fostered a shared focus on overcoming the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

Key benefits and reasons for prioritizing international collaboration include:
*   **Rapid Learning and Adaptation** Teams had to quickly grasp unfamiliar situations and adapt their methodological approaches, moving away from lengthy randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to providing rapid advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. International sharing helps in this rapid learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.
*   **Solving Complex Problems** Behavioral science teams can collectively work to solve major issues rather than each entity trying to do everything themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Reinvention** Learning from the experiences of other countries, such as India, Brazil, Canada, or France, allows practitioners to contextualize lessons for their own realities and avoid duplicating experiments that have already been conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.
*   **Mutual Support and Reassurance** Sharing difficulties among practitioners provides comfort and reassurance that others are facing similar challenges, indicating that approaches are not "out of line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.
*   **Building on Successes** In some regions, like Qatar, early transparency regarding infection numbers encouraged other countries to follow suit, demonstrating how a "first mover" can influence regional norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Recommendations

For the future of behavioral science in government, there is a strong emphasis on continued and expanded [[International collaboration during crises | international collaboration]].

Key recommendations for strengthening this collaboration include:
*   **Dedicated Networks and Communities** Establishing and supporting groups where behavioral insights practitioners from different countries can exchange best practices and share challenges is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.
*   **"What Works" Centers** Creating centralized resources, such as a "what works center," to quickly find information on best practices for crisis response, compliance with health measures, effective communication strategies, and appropriate messengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **Platforms for Expert Questions** Developing platforms where practitioners can ask questions and receive rapid answers from experts or other practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.
*   **Shared Standards and Labels** Implementing a labeling system or indicators for the type and quality of evidence used in behavioral science recommendations (e.g., based on surveys, interviews, or randomized controlled trials). This would help set clear expectations for policymakers regarding the rigor and robustness of advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
*   **Pre-registration of Trials** Encouraging the pre-registration of trials across the behavioral insights community to assess the accuracy of intuitions and predictions about what interventions will or will not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.
*   **Global South Collaboration** Expanding collaboration among countries in the Global South, especially considering the vast undocumented work and unique policy challenges in these regions. Digital communication tools can facilitate this exchange of ideas and lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.

Beyond formal collaboration, there is also a personal commitment among practitioners to foster empathy and understanding of diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>.

> "It's so rare that we're all trying to do the same thing more or less at the same time and there is so much to learn so I really hope you know it's tough being down here in Australia particularly while we can't travel but international cooperation is a big one for me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>

The future of behavioral science also involves building capacity within governments, fostering a new generation of behavioral science-minded officials, and integrating new technologies like AI and big data, all while maintaining a strong focus on ethical standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

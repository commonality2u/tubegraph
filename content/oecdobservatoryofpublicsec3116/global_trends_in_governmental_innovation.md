This article summarizes key [[Global trends in public sector innovation trends | public sector innovation trends]] and initiatives identified by the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation (MBRCGI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## About the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI)

The OPSI, based at the OECD in Paris with 36 member governments, is a team of about ten people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. OPSI's mission is three-pronged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>:
1.  **Provide Trusted Advice**: Offer direct advice to governments on achieving [[innovation in government | public sector innovation]] and adopting different ways of doing things, including country reviews (e.g., Canada, Brazil) and smaller projects/workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
2.  **Uncover What's Next**: Track [[global trends in public sector innovation | global trends]], anticipate future developments, and understand emerging [[public sector innovation trends | innovation trends]] to inform current actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
3.  **Turn the New into Normal**: Provide tools, resources, and frameworks to help governments embed [[innovation in government | innovation]] as a daily practice rather than an ad-hoc exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation (MBRCGI)

The MBRCGI is incubated within the Prime Minister's Office of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Its main mandate is to stimulate and enrich the culture of [[innovation in government | innovation]] within the government sector in the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. They also track worldwide [[public sector innovation trends | innovation]] with OPSI's support, showcasing innovative projects at the World Government Summit's "Edge of Government" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Methodology for Tracking Trends

OPSI's trend-tracking work involves a large annual crowdsourcing call for innovations, which has grown each year, combined with in-depth research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. For the past year, they surfaced 552 innovations from 84 different countries, spending several months analyzing and often visiting and meeting with individuals to discuss their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

The goals of this work include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>:
*   Surfacing new ideas and approaches to prepare for what's next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   Facilitating a network of innovators by connecting and convening those behind successful cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Working to embed and duplicate successes, reducing the impact of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   Speeding up the process of [[innovation in government | innovation]] by enabling people to learn from each other and leverage existing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Key Trends in Public Sector Innovation

The report covered three main [[public sector innovation trends | trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### 1. Invisible to Visible

This trend signifies a maturity in existing practices and new applications of technologies to make previously hidden insights or excluded individuals visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

#### Sub-trends:
*   **Behavioral Insights (Nudges)**: Governments are increasingly using behavioral insights (often called nudges) to understand human motivations and guide citizens towards desired actions, such as paying taxes on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Over 200 government-related behavioral insights units have emerged in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Gamification (Serious Games)**: Beyond traditional "post-it based" workshops, governments are developing "serious games" and other gamification methods to foster [[innovation in government | innovation]] and overcome workshop fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. An example is the European Commission's scenario exploration system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Immersive Technologies (AR/VR)**: With reduced costs, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are used by governments (especially local) to engage citizens in new ways, bringing in voices not typically heard in political processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Finding Places (Hamburg, Germany)**: An MIT lab worked with the Hamburg government to use AR and Lego blocks to allow citizens to physically build potential refugee location sites in their communities, fostering community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Citizen Science**: Governments leverage the collective power of citizens to make observations and tackle scientific challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. There's a growing maturity in this model with systemic use and thousands of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Zika Mozzie Seeker (Queensland, Australia)**: Thousands of citizen scientists deploy traps to catch mosquitoes, sending samples to DNA labs to detect Zika virus presence, enabling proactive public safety measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Positive Deviance**: Governments study "positive outliers" in society to understand factors contributing to their success, aiming to generalize these learnings to a broader population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. For example, the UN Development Program in Pakistan studied young women achieving career success in challenging environments to replicate their strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

#### Case Study: Carrot Rewards (Canada)
The "Carrot Rewards" app, winner of the Edge of Government award, is Canada's national wellness rewards platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. It combines gamification and behavioral insights to understand citizen motivations and address rising healthcare costs by promoting wellness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Users earn points for healthy behaviors (e.g., walking goals, quizzes) which can be redeemed through popular Canadian loyalty programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. The app partnered with the flu campaign, sending push notifications and geo-localization quizzes, leading to 30,000 people getting flu shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

### 2. Opening Doors

This trend focuses on how governments are making participation and benefits more accessible for at-risk and underserved populations, especially given increasing societal complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

#### Sub-trends:
*   **New Currency (Circular Economy)**: Governments are exploring non-monetary "currencies" where common goods can be exchanged for social rewards or welfare, often linked to sustainability efforts and the circular economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.
*   **Platform Economy (Government as a Platform)**: Inspired by private sector platform apps (e.g., Airbnb, Uber), governments are exploring how they can act as platforms to utilize underutilized public resources for social good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Underutilized Government Buildings (Amsterdam, Netherlands)**: A pilot in Amsterdam explored using underutilized government buildings in evenings/weekends for NGOs, addressing security and insurance issues to benefit the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.
*   **Access to Justice**: With the advent of new technologies and open data, access to justice is rapidly increasing, a core tenet of democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Clear My Records (California, USA)**: A civil society project used open criminal records to help individuals expunge old convictions no longer illegal, which is critical for employment and social mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.

#### Case Study: Recyclables as Transportation Fare (Surabaya, Indonesia)
In Surabaya, Indonesia, the second-largest city, an initiative launched in 2018 allows citizens to pay for bus fare with recyclable bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. Indonesia faces significant plastic waste issues with only a 2% recycling rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. The exchange rate for about two hours of travel is approximately 3 x 1.5-liter bottles or 5 x 600-milliliter bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. This initiative aims to reduce waste, create a more circular economy, and make transportation more accessible for citizens lacking economic means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

### 3. Machine-Readable World

This trend highlights governments' efforts to make inputs and information machine-readable and consumable, feeding into algorithms and emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

#### Sub-trends:
*   **Open Government Data & Machine-Readable Products**: Governments have extensively opened up data to fuel [[innovation in government | innovation]], entrepreneurship, and economic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. This has led to many apps (e.g., weather, GPS) built on government-provided machine-readable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.
*   **Emerging Technologies (Blockchain, AI)**: Governments are exploring emerging technologies like blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) by testing pilots or conducting feasibility studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Machine Learning for Land Mapping (Queensland, Australia)**: Queensland is converting manual land surveying processes into machine-readable land features using satellite imagery and machine learning, useful for disaster management and land development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Blockchain & AI for Counterfeit Medicine (Mongolia)**: A pilot in Mongolia combines blockchain and AI to track every transaction and change of hands for medicines, aiming to detect counterfeit drugs (40% of medicines are fake in Mongolia) and prevent injuries/deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.
*   **Ethical Considerations**: It's crucial for governments to integrate ethical considerations into the design and implementation of emerging technologies to ensure a positive role and avoid negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. For example, China's Social Credit system, while innovative in data use, raises significant ethical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.
*   **Government's Role**: The exact role of government in emerging technologies is still evolving, but it could shift from direct service provision to providing safeguards and assurances for decentralized systems, ensuring effectiveness and ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. Governments need to engage with nascent technologies to better understand their potential impact and make educated decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.

#### Case Study: Better Rules (New Zealand)
New Zealand is converting laws, policies, and rules into machine-readable formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. This allows for instantaneous application of rules by computers, ensuring the law's intent matches its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. The project works with software developers to translate rules into clear, precise code with consistent definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. This shortens feedback loops between legislative intent and implementation, providing an authoritative source on legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. It also lays groundwork for future AI applications in legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

Examples include an app in the Netherlands allowing elderly people to extend traffic light crossing times, a biofuel made from cow manure in Pakistan, and the recyclables as currency initiative in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.
*   **Massive City**: Showcased Singapore's use of AI to predict bus driver accidents based on behavioral study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.
*   **Hyper-Charged Your Harvest**: Featured a project from China using electricity to grow organic plants and reduce pesticide use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>.

## [[Strategies for fostering government innovation | Factors for Successful Innovation]] and Avoiding Failure

OPSI focuses on identifying positive factors and [[strategies for fostering government innovation | success factors]] that improve the chances of [[innovation in government | innovation]] success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. Lack of these factors often leads to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

Key factors include:
*   **Avoiding Reinventing the Wheel**: Governments often waste time trying to create from scratch something already done elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. Learning from others' successes and failures, even across borders, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.
*   **Diverse Perspectives**: Ensuring a wide range of diverse viewpoints in the decision-making process helps avoid misassumptions and better meet public needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.
*   **Multidisciplinary Approaches**: Supporting multidisciplinary teams (e.g., policy analysts, lawyers, designers, coders) to collectively examine problems from various angles leads to better solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.
*   **Building Ethics into the Process**: Integrating ethical considerations at every step of an initiative helps ensure a positive impact and minimizes unintended negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.
*   **Correct Problem Framing**: The public sector often receives predetermined problems and solutions without time to review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. Continuously questioning assumptions, challenging hypotheses, and testing them is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.
*   **Iterative Implementation**: To mitigate risks inherent in [[innovation in government | innovation]], processes should be iterative, tackling problems in chunks, assessing results, and learning before the next step, rather than adhering to rigid, long-term plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.
*   **Appropriate Methodologies and Tools**: Using the right approaches and tools for specific problems is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. OPSI's "facets model" helps link types of [[innovation in government | innovation]] (e.g., top-down vs. bottom-up, high vs. low uncertainty) to appropriate methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

## Resources for Innovators

OPSI actively builds a network of innovators to connect, collaborate, and learn from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. Resources include:
*   **Case Study Database**: Available on OPSI's website, allowing users to read case studies and connect directly with submitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.
*   **Community Platform**: Aims to build discussion forums and groups for innovators to share ideas and tackle complex challenges together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.
*   **Toolkit Navigator**: Provides hundreds of open-source tools and toolkits classified by objectives, enabling direct application of learnings to new contexts with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.

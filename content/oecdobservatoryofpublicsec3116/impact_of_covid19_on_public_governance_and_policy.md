The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a major systemic shock, revealing deep and long-term consequences for [[future_of_public_governance_postcovid19 | public governance]] and policy worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This crisis has highlighted existing vulnerabilities and spurred discussions on the need for radical reforms in prevailing policy directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Governments' Initial Responses and Narratives

Governments have responded to the crisis with two main narratives:
*   **"Let's go back to normal"** aiming to fix everything to return to the pre-crisis state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   **"Let's not waste a good crisis"** seizing the opportunity for a serious sustainable transition, recognizing the system's prior vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

Many governments initially took emergency measures constrained by pre-pandemic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. However, there is a growing consensus that the crisis has demonstrated a systemic change is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## Emerging Vulnerabilities and Challenges

The pandemic has exposed and exacerbated pre-existing issues:
*   **Inequality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>: The gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" has grown significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. In Helsinki, COVID-19 prevalence aligns with areas of high unemployment and immigrant populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. In the US, racial disparities in death rates are stark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.
*   **Inadequate Governance Systems**: The crisis revealed flaws in existing governance, which was not aligned with its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. The vulnerabilities witnessed today are a testament to the inadequacy of the worldview that shaped current systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Trends**: The pandemic has accelerated existing global long-term trends rather than changing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.
*   **Austerity**: Significant budget shortfalls are emerging for cities and countries globally due to dwindling tax revenues, higher unemployment, and rising healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>.
*   **Outdated Preparedness**: Pre-existing pandemic preparedness strategies, like Finland's 2008 plan, were found to be outdated or non-functional in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>.
*   **Silos and Lack of Integration**: Governments struggled with inter-agency cooperation, leading to breakdowns in coordinated responses, such as at Helsinki Airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

## The Need for Systemic Change

The crisis underscores the vital need for governments to:
*   **Adapt and Remain Relevant**: Institutions must evolve to stay relevant in a fast-changing context and align with emerging worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **Identify Leverage Points**: It is crucial to quickly understand key leverage points to help systems adapt and reach a new stage better suited to new conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.
*   **Rethink Preparedness**: Global reliance on offshore industrial capacity highlights the need for nations to maintain local industrial capacity for critical supplies like masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.
*   **Move Beyond Linear Thinking**: The tendency to stimulate linear thinking for quick electoral results needs to be overcome by embracing systemic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>.

## New Approaches and Tools for Public Governance

To facilitate systemic change, several approaches are being explored or recommended:

### Systems Thinking Tools
*   **Complex System Analyzer**: Developed by the EU Policy Lab, this two-day workshop helps identify leverage points in complex systems and connect them to a future vision aligned with a more sustainable worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
*   **Government as a System Toolkit**: The UK Policy Lab has built a toolkit to demystify the [[role_of_government_after_covid19 | role of government]] by mapping 56 different actions across local, regional, national, and international levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. This tool categorizes government actions from formal powers (legislating, funding) to softer powers (collaborating, enabling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

### Policy Evolution
*   **Strategic Management**: Policymaking can be viewed as a series of experiments over time, where small, collective actions can lead to a paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.
*   **Speculative Design**: Bringing together design and foresight expertise can help in thinking about the future in new ways and expanding the "Overton Window" of what's possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.
*   **Regenerative Public Services**: Moving from a traditional, efficient bureaucracy ("doing things right") to a regenerative and restorative approach ("doing the right things") is crucial for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.

### Real-time Learning and Adaptation
*   **Learning Teams**: Governments need to embed learning teams within their core and on the frontlines to absorb and transform lessons from the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.
*   **Openness and Collaboration**: Bringing together diverse expertise, including external experts, and understanding lived experiences through remote methods can provide fresh perspectives for policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>.

### Reimagining Regulation
The pandemic revealed that traditional government inspections and rule-based regulations, particularly in safety and security, may not be as effective as previously believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Many rules do not correspond with positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>.

A potential [[impact_of_pandemic_on_government_practice | system change]] involves shifting responsibility for controlling and inspecting regulation, and even writing regulations, from governments to actors within society, coupled with mandatory insurance for risk-based liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. This requires governments to "step down" and trust society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:35">[01:04:35]</a>.

## The Path Forward

The period following the initial shock of COVID-19 presents a critical, narrow window of opportunity for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. Key considerations include:
*   **Addressing Legacy Lock-ins**: It's crucial to address reliance on carbon-intensive economies and their link to social inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.
*   **Exit Strategies**: Developing comprehensive exit strategies, distinct from mere crisis management, is vital to transition to a better system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. These strategies must be socially engaged and creatively driven, not just technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.
*   **Investing in Austerity**: Instead of cutting to save, governments should consider cutting to invest, using savings to build new capabilities and capabilities for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>. This requires an adaptive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

The crisis provides a significant opportunity for governments to reform and rethink their operations, moving from a tactical response to building resilient and adaptive systems for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.

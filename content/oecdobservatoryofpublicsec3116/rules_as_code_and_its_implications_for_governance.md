Rules as Code (RulAC) is an emerging concept that re-thinks the core function of government: rulemaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>. It involves creating an official, machine-consumable version of rules alongside natural language versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:38">[03:42:38]</a>. This allows rules to be understood and acted upon consistently by computer systems, going beyond traditional communication to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:01">[03:54:01]</a>.

## Defining Rules as Code

RulAC can be conceptualized in two ways:
*   **As an Output:** A coded version of rules that computers can understand and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:58">[02:36:58]</a>. While coded rules already exist (e.g., in online tax return platforms), these are typically created by businesses or individuals based on natural language versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:01">[02:47:01]</a>.
*   **As an Approach:** A strategic, deliberate, and systemic method that conceives and creates machine-consumable rules from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>. This approach fundamentally changes *when, what, why, how*, and *for whom* rules are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>.

## Driving Factors and Opportunities

The shift towards RulAC is driven by several factors and presents significant opportunities for public administration:

*   **Responding to a New Context:** Governments operate in a rapidly changing, increasingly digital, and complex world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:02">[02:26:02]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis highlighted extreme uncertainty and accelerated digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   **Improving Rules and Policy Modeling:** RulAC enables greater and more consistent policy modeling by government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. It helps identify "gray areas" in legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a> and makes it easier to model the impact of potential changes in law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing the "Translation Gap":** There is a significant gap between legislation written in natural language and its implementation on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:21">[02:29:21]</a>. This can lead to incorrect or inconsistent application of rules, even mispaying people due to spreadsheet errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. RulAC aims to close this "policy-service chasm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Empowering Citizens and Businesses:** RulAC makes it easier for people to understand their rights and obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. It can create tools that enable citizens to better understand their entitlements to benefits or obligations for paying taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. This also reduces pressure on civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Regulating a Machine-Driven World:** Machines are increasingly users of rules and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. RulAC allows for automated monitoring, pattern analysis, and intelligence gathering on the impact and effectiveness of regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This also helps design new security and intervention paradigms suitable for the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Enhanced [[trust_and_transparency_in_public_governance | Transparency]] and Accountability:** By co-drafting human and machine-readable rules simultaneously, and making them available as APIs, RulAC improves traceability between implemented decisions and the underlying law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This addresses concerns about fairness, as machines making decisions can be audited and linked directly to the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. It allows for public consultation on policies and algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   **Fostering Multi-Disciplinary Collaboration:** Effective rule-making in a [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | complex]] world requires bringing together policy makers, legislators, service designers, data specialists, and end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. This interdisciplinary approach enables rapid, agile, and test-driven policy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Designing Better Futures:** RulAC contributes to transforming how policy is done, making it more iterative, test-driven, and co-designed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This allows for rapid and confident responses to global challenges like pandemics, ensuring policy intent is realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. It also helps address issues of [[addressing_inequality_and_inclusion_in_governance | inequality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Government as a Platform:** RulAC is seen as a key piece in the broader vision of "government as a platform," enabling more innovation and impactful social changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.

## Principles of Rules as Code

Key principles underpinning RulAC include:
*   [[trust_and_transparency_in_public_governance | Transparency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>
*   Traceability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>
*   Accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>
*   Appropriateness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>
*   Security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>

## Examples and Case Studies

*   **France:** The "Open Fisca" project, initiated by the Ministry of Finance in 2011-2012, began as simulation software to understand the impact of law changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. It was open-sourced, evolving into tools that helped citizens understand their rights and obligations for benefits and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. Later initiatives like "Lex Impact" aimed to make the potential impact of legislative changes more readable and predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:27]</a>.
*   **New Zealand:** The "Better Rules" initiative brought global attention to RulAC, focusing on the theoretical groundwork and the feedback loop between rules and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Canada:** Also actively striving to implement RulAC approaches, particularly in areas related to service delivery and regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Direction

Rules as Code is still an emerging concept, requiring testing and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Key challenges include:

*   **Organizational and Cultural Change:** RulAC is not merely a technocratic solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. It requires breaking silos and building interdisciplinary teams of drafters, coders, economists, and policy officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   **[[balancing_legislative_intent_with_machinereadable_rules | Balancing Prescriptive and Principles-Based Rules]]:** Not all law can be codified. While clear prescriptive rules are helpful for consistency in implementation, some areas require interpretation and discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. The aim is not to automate judgment or justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>, but to clarify and make transparent what can be codified.
*   **Starting Small and Iterating:** Instead of a grand plan, it's more effective to find specific areas of need, start small, prototype, and iterate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. The focus should be on yielding tangible benefits and being driven by use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Harnessing Collective Intelligence:** No single public agency has all the intelligence to write all the rules. RulAC encourages alliances with civil society, hackers, researchers, and developers, and promoting open-source practices to improve and scrutinize policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   **Limitations and Avoiding Fantasy:** RulAC is about algorithms and increased transparency, not about "criminal justice given by robots" or "machine learning based on jurisprudence" that might repeat past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. It aims to make rules more understandable for both humans and machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>.

Ultimately, RulAC is part of a broader, necessary shift for [[future_governance_and_leadership | future governance and leadership]] to be resilient, effective, and responsive in the face of exponential change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. It's about transforming [[public_trust_and_governance | public administration]] and [[governance_and_technology_interaction | governance and technology interaction]], enabling government to serve citizens more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. It's not just about technology, but how technology integrates with cultures and practices to better engage with people and machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

The increasing complexity of modern challenges means that problems often extend beyond traditional governmental silos, requiring new approaches to policy and governance, especially concerning technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. This necessitates a more integrated, anticipatory process throughout government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12]">[01:11:12]</a>, and increasingly, calls for significant [[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | citizen participation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54]">[00:20:54]</a>.

## Why Involve Citizens?

[[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | Collaboration between governments and citizens]] is crucial because governments cannot hold a monopoly on truth, especially with complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20]">[00:21:20]</a>. Citizens offer valuable insights that can complement government policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33]">[00:21:33]</a>. Their involvement helps break down government silos, as citizens tend to think about future problems rather than specific ministries or agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37]">[00:23:37]</a>.

## Methods and Approaches

Several methods are employed to foster [[citizencentered_governance_and_engagement | citizen-centered governance and engagement]] in technology policy:

*   **Citizen Juries/Deliberative Processes** These formats involve structured learning periods, where citizens are equipped with data and information from experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25]">[01:20:25]</a>. Facilitators then guide discussions using oblique, non-technical questions (e.g., asking about fears or hopes for the future) to extract implicit qualitative data and identify interesting emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50]">[01:21:50]</a>.
*   **Public Dialogues** Initiatives like the Netherlands' dialogue on human DNA modification demonstrate how returning to society can unlock discussions that political parties might avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10]">[00:36:10]</a>. These dialogues can shift the focus from technical details to broader societal questions about values and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09]">[00:37:09]</a>. They aim to present a broad range of opinions, including minority stances, rather than simply averaging out views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:48]">[01:23:48]</a>.
*   **Living Labs and Test Beds** These designated experimental spaces test transformative technologies under real-world conditions, ideally with public participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12]">[00:47:12]</a>. The shift is from testing technologies *in* societies to testing societies *around* new technologies, prompting reflection on desired societal futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25]">[00:48:25]</a>.
*   **Co-creation** While diverse in its forms, co-creation aims to bring different innovation actors together for joint activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05]">[00:53:05]</a>. It's crucial to scrutinize the power dynamics within these processes, ensuring diverse voices, like patients, relatives, insurers, and managers, are considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37]">[00:53:37]</a>.
*   **National Innovation Challenges** Governments can define clear challenges (e.g., energy, land use) and invite creative solutions from the private sector and citizens, optimizing for public policy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34]">[01:37:34]</a>.

## Examples in Practice

*   **Singapore's Foresight System** Singapore has a well-established foresight system, diversifying its toolkit beyond scenario planning to include methods like emerging strategic issues and causal layered analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40]">[01:14:40]</a>. While technology and science elements are strong in foresight, formal foresight is less common within the science, technology, and innovation (STI) ecosystem itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11]">[01:17:11]</a>. The National Research Foundation, however, is increasingly integrating foresight into STI policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40]">[01:19:40]</a>. Singapore's "Emerging Stronger" [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | citizen engagement]] process, launched during the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitated discussions on pivoting society to leverage digital transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41]">[01:21:41]</a>.
*   **The Netherlands' Rathenau Institute** This independent institute supports the parliament with long-term views on the societal impact of science, technology, and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17]">[00:27:17]</a>. They identify political questions raised by new developments (e.g., mass unemployment from disruption) and determine where societal deliberation is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50]">[00:27:50]</a>. A standing parliamentary committee now deals with the future of digital society, allowing for forward-looking discussions on topics like 6G or [[emerging_technologies_in_governance | virtual reality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00]">[00:31:00]</a>. They also work on "tentative governance" for complex transitions like geothermal energy, anticipating new technical and political questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00]">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

*   **Defining Citizen Role and Selection** The role of citizens must be clearly defined, and participants selected carefully to avoid bypassing collective advocacy groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56]">[01:22:56]</a>. The aim should be to create a space for broader opinions, including minority stances, not just to average out individual views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:48]">[01:23:48]</a>.
*   **Knowledge and Future Implications** Citizens need to be equipped with relevant information to participate meaningfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25]">[01:20:25]</a>. A key challenge is how current citizens can defend the interests of future generations, as it's difficult to predict how people will interact with technology in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:05]">[01:26:05]</a>.
*   **Sustainability of Engagement** [[participatory_processes_and_governance | Participatory processes and governance]], including co-creation communities, are hard to maintain, often tied to short-term project funding rather than institutionalized long-term visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:34]">[01:29:34]</a>.
*   **Private Sector Engagement** While the public sector often leads in basic research, the private sector is key in implementing and scaling [[technological_advancements_in_governance | technological advancements in governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:52]">[01:31:52]</a>. Ensuring the private sector incorporates ethical and [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | citizen trust]] considerations is challenging, partly because startups prioritize survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:09]">[01:35:09]</a>. Solutions include defining public value as a common language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42]">[01:40:42]</a>, promoting value-driven corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32]">[01:35:32]</a>, and fostering radical transdisciplinarity to embed societal values from the design stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16]">[01:36:16]</a>.
*   **Impact on Policy** A critical question is whether insights from citizen dialogues are genuinely integrated into concrete policies and technological interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21]">[01:41:21]</a>.

## Future Directions

There is a recognized need to bridge the communities doing foresight for governmental systems and those doing foresight and technology assessment in the STI community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06]">[01:06:06]</a>. This integration is crucial because technology and governance co-evolve, deeply implicating each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39]">[01:06:39]</a>. The goal is to develop the deliberative capacity of various communities to engage in discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14]">[01:13:14]</a>, supported by mediated expertise, journalism, and multi-disciplinary education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:38]">[01:33:38]</a>. This includes bringing government officials, private sector representatives, and citizens together to envision desired futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:11]">[01:34:11]</a>.

[[behavioral_public_policy | Behavioral public policy]] aims to improve public services and build trust in public institutions by applying [[application_of_behavioral_science | behavioral science]] principles to policy design and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:06">[03:27:06]</a>. This approach focuses on understanding human behaviors and the drivers and barriers that influence them, thereby offering pragmatic solutions to complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:04">[07:34:04]</a>.

## Core Concepts

### Sludge
"Sludge" refers to unnecessary frictions within public services that block access, impose psychological costs, and erode trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:17">[05:46:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:07">[05:48:07]</a>. While the term is relatively new, the burden it describes is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:07">[07:05:07]</a>. Often, sludge in government is unintentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:09">[12:41:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:03">[13:16:03]</a>.

Common examples of sludge in public services include:
*   Information that is hard to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:02">[12:54:02]</a>.
*   Processes that are hard to understand or complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:07">[12:57:07]</a>.
*   Very long waiting times without updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:03">[13:00:03]</a>.
*   Complex decision points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:06">[13:11:06]</a>.

### Nudge
In contrast to sludge, "nudge" refers to improvements to the choice architecture that make it easier for people to access and use public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:08">[12:02:08]</a>. Sludge is sometimes described as the "bad brother" of nudge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:08">[12:16:08]</a>.

### Psychological Costs
A key value of discussing "sludge" is its emphasis on psychological costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:02">[13:28:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:07">[13:33:07]</a>. These costs are often intuitive but difficult to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:02">[13:46:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:06">[13:48:06]</a>. The paper "Fixing Frictions" attempts to better define and categorize these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:09">[13:38:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:06">[13:50:06]</a>.

Categories of psychological costs include:
*   **Search costs:** Occur when people search for information that is hard to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:08">[14:07:08]</a>.
*   **Decision costs:** Experienced when evaluating options, especially when they are similar, leading to psychological overload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:04">[14:17:04]</a>.
*   **Cognitive costs:** The mental resources spent fulfilling requirements or understanding complex information, sometimes referred to as "brain capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:08">[14:31:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:05">[14:49:05]</a>.
*   **Emotional costs:** Include stigma, loss of autonomy, and feelings of stress, disempowerment, anxiety, or frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:05">[15:01:05]</a>.

Psychological costs disproportionately impact vulnerable people, including vulnerable groups and individuals experiencing challenging life circumstances (e.g., natural disasters, giving birth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:03">[15:21:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:05">[15:35:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:05">[15:53:05]</a>. This is partly due to "cognitive scarcity," which makes navigating sludge especially challenging for those who are ill, sick, or poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:34:02">[53:34:02]</a>.

## Goals and Impact of Behavioral Science in Policy

The [[role_of_behavioral_science_in_government | role of behavioral science in government]] and [[behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] goes beyond administrative efficiency, aiming to reshape public services to be more equitable, accessible, and trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:07">[08:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:05">[10:06:05]</a>. This approach enhances government responsiveness and bolsters trust, particularly among vulnerable populations who rely most on public services and are most likely to suffer psychological burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:07">[08:09:07]</a>.

Key benefits of reducing sludge:
*   **Building trust:** People's experiences with government services directly influence their perception of government and public satisfaction, which is a driver of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:08">[03:48:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:07">[03:55:07]</a>.
*   **Improving effectiveness:** Reducing frictions makes governments more effective and equitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>.
*   **Promoting equity and inclusiveness:** Sludge disproportionately affects underserved communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:04">[08:16:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:03">[26:10:03]</a>. Sludge reduction is seen as crucial for promoting inclusiveness and equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:07">[42:02:07]</a>.
*   **Addressing cognitive biases:** [[behavioral_science_in_public_governance | Behavioral science in public governance]] highlights how human cognitive biases like unrealistic optimism, procrastination, and present bias exacerbate the problem of sludge, making it a significant hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:46:04">[51:46:04]</a>.

## Key Initiatives and Collaboration

### OECD Network for Behavioral Insights Experts in Government
This network, established by the OECD, is a center of over 100 government officials from more than 50 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>. It facilitates knowledge exchange and [[international_collaboration_in_behavioral_policy | international collaboration in behavioral policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>. The OECD also focuses on building trust in public institutions as a key priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:06">[03:27:06]</a>.

### International Sludge Academy
The first International Sludge Academy was established by the OECD through its network of [[behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:08">[02:51:08]</a>. It's a platform where the government of New South Wales guides officials from other countries in deploying their sludge audit method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:02">[02:56:02]</a>. The initiative began with 22 countries expressing interest, from which 16 teams from 14 countries were selected to conduct parallel sludge audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:04">[20:48:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:03">[20:55:03]</a>.

### New South Wales Sludge Audit Methodology
Developed by the Behavioral Insights Unit in the New South Wales Department of Customer Service, this method has been in use for four years and has been tested on nearly 100 audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:06">[16:37:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:01">[19:13:01]</a>. It brings a behavioral lens to service improvement, focusing on quantifying psychological costs and equity aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:09">[17:11:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:04">[18:32:04]</a>.

The methodology has seven steps, with four key metrics: time, cost, effort, and inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:07">[19:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:04">[19:28:04]</a>. The method emphasizes measuring impact to ensure changes make a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:09">[19:59:09]</a>.

Key principles for conducting sludge audits, derived from the International Sludge Academy experience:
*   **Control over change:** Assess how much control the team has over changing the process or implementing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:02">[23:21:02]</a>.
*   **Common methodology:** Using a predefined, tested, and validated methodology ensures rigor, replicability, and allows for comparisons across different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:01">[24:25:01]</a>.
*   **Tailoring to context:** Accommodate complicated and non-linear behavioral journeys, where users might undertake multiple stages simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:02">[25:04:02]</a>.
*   **Equity lens:** Deploy an equity lens throughout the process, potentially focusing the audit purely on the experience of underserved communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:07">[26:05:07]</a>.
*   **Evaluating progress:** Translate audits into real changes and recommit services to measure the impact of changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:37:08">[26:37:08]</a>.
*   **System enablers:** Success requires a government committed to improving user services, close connection to service owners, and systematically collected customer survey data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>.

## Case Studies and Applications

### France: Assistance for Independent Living (APAA)
The French [[behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] team used the sludge audit method to simplify the APAA application process, which helps elderly people receive aid to stay at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:08">[30:40:08]</a>. The process had high abandonment rates due to complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:06">[31:12:06]</a>. The audit involved interviewing 20 people across nine departments (caregivers, applicants, professionals) and reviewing existing forms to understand psychological costs like frustration and abandonment points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:02">[32:09:02]</a>.

Key takeaways from the French experience:
*   Very user-centric, helping the administration understand the user's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:08">[34:02:08]</a>.
*   Provided an objective analysis of complexities and areas for time-saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:13:06">[34:13:06]</a>.
*   Multi-dimensional, including insights on psychological costs and inclusion issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:24:00">[34:24:00]</a>.
*   Enabled autonomous diagnosis and replication by the administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>.
*   Challenges included a lack of objective data, requiring extensive information gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:05">[34:58:05]</a>.

### Brazil: Gov.br Account Recovery
Brazil's Ministry of Management and Public Services Innovation audited the recovery process for the Gov.br account, the main entrance to over 4,000 digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:54:06">[36:54:06]</a>. While the automated recovery process (using digital and facial recognition) works for most, a manual online form process exists for those who cannot use automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:10:00">[37:10:00]</a>. This manual process, used by over 100 million people annually, disproportionately affects vulnerable users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:50:06">[37:50:06]</a>.

Brazil is developing its own tool and methodology, aiming for a self-applied tool usable by federal, state, and municipal governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:05">[38:13:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:02">[40:28:02]</a>. The tool recognizes different user journeys and includes an "equity check" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27:00">[39:27:00]</a>.

Key lessons from Brazil:
*   Sludge audits are a good entry point for [[behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] in governments, being easy to communicate and show results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:56:06">[40:56:06]</a>.
*   Sludge audit tools themselves should be designed to avoid sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:09:02">[41:09:02]</a>.
*   Labeling "sludge" can be challenging (e.g., "audit" has a bad connotation in Brazil; "sludge" is hard to communicate), suggesting a need for more positive framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:33:04">[41:33:04]</a>.

### United States: Free School Meals and Immigration
Sludge audits have led to significant improvements in the US:
*   **Free School Meals:** A small sludge audit led to "direct certification," where schools automatically provide free meals if they know children are poor, eliminating the need for parents to navigate an application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:40:00">[48:40:00]</a>. This reform provides free meals to over 10 million children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:20:00">[49:20:00]</a>.
*   **Immigration Worker Authorization:** The renewal period for lawful workers' authorization was extended from 180 days to 540 days, significantly reducing sludge for vulnerable workers and their employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:20:00">[50:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50:00">[50:50:00]</a>.

## Future Directions for Behavioral Science in Policy

There is a clear need to [[mainstreaming_behavioral_science_in_government | mainstreaming behavioral science in government]] and continue the work on sludge reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:01">[08:41:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:06">[28:11:06]</a>.

Future directions highlighted include:
*   **International Comparisons:** Leveraging international partnerships (like the OECD's role) to compare findings across jurisdictions and build a global evidence base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:07">[28:31:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:09">[28:50:09]</a>.
*   **Further Methodological Development:** The sludge audit method is relatively new, with opportunities for further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:08:00">[43:08:00]</a>.
*   **Broader Application:** Extending sludge audits beyond [[behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] teams to program, policy delivery, and service delivery teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:21:00">[43:21:00]</a>.
*   **Peer Learning:** Emphasizing peer learning among teams conducting sludge audits to advance methodology and share knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:47:04">[43:47:04]</a>.
*   **Benchmarking:** Bringing countries together to analyze common processes like passport renewal to identify sludge and opportunities for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:37:05">[44:37:05]</a>.
*   **Human-Centered Public Administrative Services:** The OECD is developing an international standard recommendation on human-centered public administrative services, emphasizing putting people at the center of design and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:07">[09:39:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:07">[09:57:07]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal of [[behavioral_science_in_public_governance | behavioral science in public governance]] is to give people more "time" by reducing unnecessary burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:31:05">[55:31:05]</a>.

Governments engage in [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] for a variety of reasons, sometimes with a clear purpose and other times through more exploratory means. Both approaches are considered beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Addressing Specific Challenges

One primary driver for [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] is the need to tackle specific, recognized societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These include issues like cleaning up oceans or solving homelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In these cases, [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] is directly aimed at achieving a defined objective, providing a clear direction for activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The existence of the problem itself legitimizes the need for new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Fostering Exploration and Creativity

Governments also innovate for the sake of allowing their people to explore new ideas and be creative in addressing the [[challenges faced by governments | challenges their citizens face]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This is crucial because [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] is inherently uncertain, and the next significant breakthrough is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Similar to "entrepreneurial discovering" in the private sector, where transformative ideas often come from individuals with the freedom to "play around and explore new thinking," the public sector also needs to allow for such exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Public sector services and products require continuous revamping and transformation to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Developing the Ability to Innovate

A third vital reason for civil servants to innovate is to develop their own capacity for [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Innovators are not born but learn by doing, by exploring new ideas and thinking differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

It is essential to grant a "license to explore," experiment with new ideas, and apply them in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This ensures that when a new, significant challenge arises, there are people with the capacity to develop projects and solve problems in novel ways because they have prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This trend is evident in governments today, with programs like Finland's new experimentation program and Canada's experimentation directive, which allow government departments to test policy ideas before widespread application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Staying Current and Avoiding Stagnation

Finally, governments also innovate to avoid being left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Just as companies in the private sector continuously explore different options and solutions, governments must do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Unexplored options can represent a cost, and it is necessary to explore various avenues to remain relevant and prepared when a particular option becomes critical in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

All these activities, while valid, require different methods and strategies for effective implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

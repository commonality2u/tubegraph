[[Ethical considerations and trust in data usage | Data management]] practices, particularly in the context of [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation in government]], have a significant, often overlooked, impact on environmental sustainability. The concept of **digital decarbonization** addresses the carbon footprint associated with data generation, storage, and processing, aiming to mitigate its environmental impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

## The Growing Carbon Footprint of Data
The volume of data generated globally is immense and rapidly increasing. In the social media sphere alone, a huge volume of data is created every minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. It is projected that nearly 80 zettabytes of data will be generated by the Internet of Things (IoT), as almost everything connects to the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

The challenge lies in where this data is stored. [[role_and_management_of_data_in_digital_public_services | Data centers]], which effectively constitute the cloud, are estimated to contribute around 3% of global carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. This impact is greater than that of the aviation industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. With data volumes doubling every two years, the carbon emissions associated with data are set to grow continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

## Challenges in Public Administration
In the public sector, the issue is exacerbated by certain Digital Data practices:
*   **Data Duplication** Organizations often duplicate data, a practice that is even higher in public administrations due to extensive [[digitalization_of_government_services | digitalization efforts]] and migration to the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
*   **"Store All" Approach** While successful in some aspects, the tendency to store all data, including historic and newly created data, often leads to forgotten data that continues to consume power and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.
*   **Siloed Working and Time Constraints** Public sector organizations often operate in silos with a lack of inter-service or inter-departmental working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>. Growing demands on personnel's time mean it's often quicker to generate new data than to trace and reuse existing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.

These factors lead to a significant amount of data duplication, carrying a substantial cumulative consequence for the data's CO2 footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.

## Dark Data and Out-of-Date Data
A significant portion of stored data is "dark data," meaning it's used once or never at all, accounting for 65% of all stored data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. Additionally, 15% of data in [[role_and_management_of_data_in_digital_public_services | data warehouses]] is out-of-date, indicating poor information [[role_and_management_of_data_in_digital_public_services | governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.

The carbon footprint of seemingly small digital actions can be substantial; for example, the data generated by 100 employees working normally for 12 months is equivalent to 2,562 flights from London to New York per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. Every photo uploaded to cloud services and every email sent also contribute to this carbon footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

## Strategies for Digital Decarbonization
To address this growing concern, new approaches are being developed:

### Data Carbon Ladder
The "data carbon ladder" is a proactive approach that tracks data from its origin through its entire journey to the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. This step-by-step process helps organizations diagnose different stages of data collection, processing, use, and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>. A key question posed by this framework is: "What is the minimum viable data set required to address specific tasks or requests?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a> This question is crucial because organizations often assume data is carbon neutral, which it is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.

### Policy Integration
There is a recognized need to incorporate data carbon emissions into [[Digital transformation and Legal Frameworks | government]] policies. While CO2 emissions are a common focus in policy, specific provisions for data content and data emissions are largely absent globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>. An agreed global measurement for data's carbon footprint is being developed to facilitate its inclusion in policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.

## Government Initiatives and Impact
Governments are starting to recognize the importance of optimizing [[role_and_management_of_data_in_digital_public_services | data management]] for environmental reasons, contributing to broader [[tools_and_strategies_for_green_governance | green governance]] goals.

### Serbia's National AI Supercomputing Platform
Serbia's national AI Supercomputing Platform, located within a state [[role_and_management_of_data_in_digital_public_services | data center]] in Kragujevac, exemplifies a move towards more efficient resource utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. This platform provides computational infrastructure, essential for AI development, which is typically expensive and not easily accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. By offering this platform free of charge to stakeholders in the Serbian AI ecosystem, including startups, faculties, and research institutes, the government not only fosters innovation but also potentially centralizes computational power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>. This consolidation could reduce the overall carbon footprint by preventing numerous entities from setting up and powering their own separate [[role_and_management_of_data_in_digital_public_services | data centers]] and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. It contributes to greater efficiency and potentially less energy consumption across the entire ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.

This initiative is part of Serbia's broader focus on [[digital_transformation_and_egovernance | GovTech]] and [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | public administration transformation]], aiming for a knowledge and innovation-driven economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. Their progress in [[digital_transformation_in_government | e-government]] has been recognized globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>.

Governments are rethinking how they regulate and are developing more [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile approaches to regulation]] to realize the benefits of innovation. This includes creating space for experimentation to foster policy learning and adaptation, and to incentivize businesses to develop new products, services, ideas, and business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. [[Regulatory sandboxes and innovation | Regulatory sandboxes]] are highlighted as a particularly interesting case among these approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> due to the diversity of practices and applications across different areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### General Adoption Trends
Across the European Union, 19 member states have some experience with [[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | regulatory sandboxes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. Most of these initiatives were established recently, in 2019 and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. While the legal basis varies, some existing regulations already enable experimentation, while other cases involve adapting primary or secondary legislation, often through exemptions, derogations, special rules, or agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. Germany has even published a handbook for [[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | regulatory sandboxes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.

### Specific Sector Applications

Regulatory sandboxes are being implemented across various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

*   **Finance**: This is one of the most common sectors for [[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | regulatory sandboxes]], with 10 out of 38 sandboxes in the EU being in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a>. These often involve adapting regulations for new technologies like blockchain or distributed ledger technologies in financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.
*   **Transport**: Similar to finance, transport accounts for 10 of the EU's 38 regulatory sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a>. Testing of self-driving cars, for instance, is occurring in Austria, Germany, and Estonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. In cities, they can be used to test new mobility solutions, such as bike zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>.
*   **Energy**: The energy sector is increasingly adopting [[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | regulatory sandboxes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
    *   **Danish Energy Agency**: Denmark launched its first [[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | regulatory sandbox]] program in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. The initial motivation was to incentivize the development of new ideas, products, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. A key insight is that projects seeking exemptions are often complex, particularly struggling with regulations pertaining to infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.
    *   **GreenLab (Denmark)**: This industrial green park combines large industry and power solutions to maximize the utilization of renewable energy and energy streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Operating within a [[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | sandbox]] helps overcome regulatory barriers related to producing and transferring energy within their own grid and balancing energy streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>. The collaboration allows for learning and adapting policies to enable green change on a larger scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Data Protection**: The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) operates a [[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | regulatory sandbox]] to enable innovators using personal data to test and trial ideas under regulatory supervision, ensuring compliance and fostering trust in the digital economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:51">[01:58:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:10">[02:07:10]</a>. Examples include tackling financial crime and assisting Heathrow Airport with biometrics for passenger processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:52">[02:50:52]</a>. The ICO emphasizes the need for safeguards, transparency, and public reporting of results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:44">[02:18:44]</a>.
*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: There is a proposal at the EU level to establish a regulatory sandbox for artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.
*   **Social Field**: Finland utilizes a [[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | regulatory sandbox]] to test subsidies for entrepreneurs who hire unemployed individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>.
*   **Education**: Romania has a [[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | regulatory sandbox]] in the education sector, which includes testing hotmail in schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:11">[01:27:11]</a>.
*   **Food & Cereal Seeds**: Existing EU law already includes experimentation clauses in domains like food and cereal seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
*   **Aviation Security**: Experimentation clauses are also present in EU law concerning aviation security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.

### Cross-Sectoral and Cross-Border Considerations

Regulatory sandboxes often involve complex projects that span multiple sectors and regulatory domains. This necessitates regulators to be flexible and prepared to work cross-border and cross-sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. For instance, testing self-driving cars in different member states raises questions about developing consistent supervisory practices and avoiding fragmented regulatory solutions that could hinder a single market or scaling up innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>. There is a recognized need for European collaboration and guidance for specific challenging areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.

The scaling potential of digital innovations means they scale up almost immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:55">[01:07:55]</a>, presenting unique challenges for [[crossborder_regulatory_challenges | cross-border regulatory challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>. However, for many other innovations, starting local and sharing experiences as they scale up can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.

The primary value of [[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | regulatory sandboxes]] is to gain [[the_role_of_data_in_regulation | insights]] from businesses about ongoing innovations, risks, and opportunities, especially at early stages of technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This helps address the "regulatory lag" where government regulation lags behind innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

[[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_participation | Democratic innovations]] are significantly altering the [[power_dynamics_between_government_and_citizens | relationship between government and citizens]], shifting power towards citizens and enabling them to inform and shape policies and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Among these innovations, citizen assemblies are highlighted as a means to foster more active and meaningful [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | public participation]] in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Role of Citizen Assemblies

Citizen assemblies are a type of deliberative body typically composed of randomly selected citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Their purpose is to give citizens a direct say in [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | policy making]] and allow them to contribute meaningfully to shaping decisions that impact them and their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This approach reframes the role of individuals from passive consumers of political ideas to active agents of political change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

Examples of citizen assemblies include:
*   **Agora Brussels** operates with a member of parliament (MP) who defends the decisions and resolutions made by citizen assemblies in parliament, giving the assembly a voice in the legislative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **The Conference on the Future of Europe** is a large-scale [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_participation | democratic participatory]] exercise with a strong deliberative dimension, featuring European citizens panels. These panels consist of randomly selected citizens who meet to reflect on the future of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Similar [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | participatory]] events and citizens panels are also organized at national and regional levels within member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
*   **The UK Climate Assembly** was commissioned by six select committees of parliament, responding to public demand for citizen involvement in climate policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.

## Citizen Assemblies as a Form of Representation

While often viewed as a new form of [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | innovative citizen participation]], citizen assemblies can also be conceptualized as a new form of representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. The individuals involved act as citizen representatives, which suggests a need for rethinking and redesigning representative democracy rather than merely replacing it with [[democracy_and_public_participation_in_policy | participatory]] or direct forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.

## Impact and Challenges

The intention behind citizen assemblies is to improve public decision-making and strengthen society's [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_participation | democratic fitness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. They have shown to produce interesting results and bring out richness and diversity in discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Furthermore, participation in these processes has a transformative effect on individuals, strengthening their sense of agency and political efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>.

However, challenges remain regarding the *impact* and *power* of these assemblies:
*   **Lack of Mandate:** A significant concern is whether citizens' recommendations will lead to real, mandated change or merely remain as suggestions that politicians can choose to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. If outcomes are not assured, there's a risk of citizen frustration and the processes becoming counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Clarity:** It is crucial to be clear with citizens from the outset about whether their recommendations will be fully adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>. Without clear commitments on follow-up, such as a guaranteed percentage of recommendations to be implemented, the success or impact remains open to interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.
*   **"Cherry-Picking" Recommendations:** There's a risk that policymakers might select only those recommendations that align with existing policies, thereby undermining the genuine influence of citizen input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.
*   **Trust in Citizens:** A core issue is the need for governments to trust citizens more, moving from expert-based solutions to people-centered ones, where solutions are developed *with* the people, not just *for* them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>.
*   **Pacing of Change:** While there's a sense that change is happening in the right direction, many believe it's occurring too slowly and needs to be more institutionalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The development of citizen assemblies represents a significant shift towards a more dynamic and [[democracy_and_public_participation_in_policy | participatory democracy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. There is a strong realization that for these processes to truly thrive, cultural change is needed, not just among politicians but also in the media, to gain more visibility for innovative and peaceful democratic interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. The ultimate goal is to define and measure a broader range of democratic impacts beyond just policy changes, including trust-building, network strengthening, and increased civic engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>. This requires continued effort to make democracy more inclusive, deliberative, and impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a new impetus for [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] and highlighted opportunities for [[empowering_public_servants_with_tools_and_insights | empowering public servants]] and utilizing their skills within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. The crisis has functioned as an "unprecedented global experiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, revealing both existing problems and new possibilities for how public service functions.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Talent Liberation

While there are many dedicated individuals within central and local government striving to improve systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>, a key challenge is the perception of being "stuck" within these systems, often without the necessary leadership support to drive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.

Key dilemmas influencing the liberation of talent include:
*   **Higher expectations amidst resource constraints** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.
*   **An expectation of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] at a time of risk aversion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:16">[00:59:16]</a>.

The pandemic has also brought about a dynamic where "hierarchy is dead, long live hierarchy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>. Organizations have been compelled to operate in flatter ways, with many traditional systems falling by the wayside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. This has led to the realization that organizations can cope effectively without elaborate performance management systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>. However, entirely flat organizations beyond a certain size may not function, as difficult decisions still need to be made by leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>.

Despite these challenges, organizations have "opened up" and become more willing to accept insights from various directions, not just pre-established channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.

## Key Learnings for Talent Development

1.  **Improvisation as a vital skill**: The crisis has highlighted improvisation as a crucial skill, propelling individuals from lower ranks to important tasks, particularly those with unique expertise like digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. The question remains whether these newly recognized talents will be capitalized on post-crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.
2.  **Increased reflectivity and humility**: The emergency has reconnected many public servants to their core motivations for joining civil service, and the personal impact of the disease has reduced the distance between planners/service delivery and the affected population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>. This has fostered a sense of humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>.
3.  **Addressing exhaustion and well-being**: The crisis has also led to a profound sense of exhaustion across many levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>. This raises questions about defining well-being conditions within the public sector moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.
4.  **Unlocking full capacities**: There has been a long-standing frustration in many governments about underutilizing the full capabilities of their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>. Initiatives like the Canadian government's "free agents program" are examples of efforts to liberate talent by allowing them to move where their skills are most needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.

## Redefining Leadership and Organizational Culture

Leaders are being called upon to shift their focus from being "busy doing things" to "start being something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>. This means emphasizing values, desired behaviors, and fostering relationships, similar to the New Zealand Moral Spirit of Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>. The younger generation entering public service seeks inspirational leadership that connects them to the organization's core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.

Instead of complex formulas, leaders are encouraged to reconnect with their workforce and create safe [[Learning and capacity building in government | learning environments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>. This involves identifying passionate groups within the system and experimenting with them to build bridges and focus on "being" rather than merely "doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>.

Furthermore, recruitment efforts should focus on creating a sense of "real family" and community within the public service, ensuring new recruits feel supported and welcomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. This is seen as a key responsibility of leaders to maintain the attractiveness of public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>. The challenge of "hard to reach people" in public policy often refers to politicians themselves, highlighting the need for genuine engagement and listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>. The public is not hard to reach; they are "seldom heard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a> and can be the biggest supporters of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly highlighted the crucial importance of public trust for the effectiveness of public policies, impacting aspects like compliance with restrictions and vaccine uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. During crises, public services often adapt, frequently leveraging digital technologies to ensure citizen safety and meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. However, a significant risk, seen in previous crises like the global financial crisis, is that some citizens may feel alienated or left behind, particularly if public services fail to reach them or meet their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Drivers of Trust

According to the OECD, [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust in institutions]] is driven by several factors:
*   Responsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
*   Reliability of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
*   Perceptions of fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   Openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
*   Integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>

Both governmental and interpersonal trust are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Governments that had higher levels of trust at the pandemic's outset also saw higher rates of health behavior adoption and pro-social behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Challenges to Trust in Public Institutions

Several factors contribute to the erosion or difficulty in [[building_trust_in_publicprivate_partnerships | building trust]]:
*   **Alienation and unmet needs** Some citizens feel alienated or left behind when public services fail to reach them or meet their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Crisis management failures** In Latvia, despite 100% vaccine availability, only 50% of the population is vaccinated, leading to a full lockdown and burnout among government officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Misinformation and freedom of speech** The spread of misinformation about vaccines and COVID-19 presents a challenge in balancing freedom of speech with combating fake stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Transparency vs. "Reality Show"** Excessive transparency in crisis decision-making, where everyone can comment, risks turning governance into a "reality show" rather than effective policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Individual Freedom vs. Collective Responsibility** There is a need to balance individual freedom and democracy with responsibility and accountability for society as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Increased Distance** Data from Spain indicates that the COVID-19 crisis has increased the distance between citizens and governments, with drops in both external (system openness) and internal (capacity to influence politics) political efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Women's political efficacy, already lower, decreased more than men's, exacerbating gender inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide** While digitalization offers opportunities, it can create a gap, leaving vulnerable groups (e.g., indigenous people, the elderly) behind, especially in developing countries where inequalities are already high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   **Societal Polarization** Crises can split societies into opposing groups (e.g., pro-vaccine vs. anti-vaccine), making it challenging to find common ground and communication strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Social media exacerbates this by making it easy for anyone to spread messages, shifting discussions from facts to statements or personal stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
*   **Governmental Silos** Competition between government ministries, each representing separate group interests, can lead to internal societal competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. When governments react too much to social media, policies can become reactive rather than proactive and strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.
*   **Perception of Care** A survey found that 43% of participants did not believe their governments cared about them or were taking the right actions during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Lack of Vision and Leadership** A survey indicated a perceived lack of vision and leadership to move on from old ways, suggesting a return to pre-crisis methods rather than embracing lessons learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

## Strategies for [[building_trust_through_effective_public_administration | Building Trust]] and Inclusivity

### Communication and Transparency
*   **Timely and Clear Communication** Governments that communicate clearly and on time about necessary actions, even if the news is harsh, see citizens follow guidelines and an increase in the perception of government performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Clear communication also contributes to better mental health in times of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Telling Difficult Truths** Leaders who tell difficult truths (e.g., "this is not under control") are more effective and gain more trust than those who claim "everything is okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. Simplicity in communication is also vital, avoiding overly technical vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
*   **Government's Communication Line** Governments are responsible for maintaining a "clean" communication line, stating clear government opinions and arguments, rather than constantly reacting to social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
*   **Transparency in Spending** Citizens should be reminded that public services are paid for by their taxes, fostering greater ownership and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

### Local Level Engagement
*   **Importance of the Local** Focusing on the local level, including local leaders, community-based policies, and community trust, has proven effective, as seen in countries like Bangladesh and Sierra Leone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Local communication is easier and less ideologically charged than national communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Community Mechanisms** Instead of creating new top-down mechanisms, governments should observe and utilize how communities and citizens already engage, recognizing the diversity of citizen participation preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

### Inclusive Policy Making
*   **Co-creation and Innovative Tools** The session explores innovative and inclusive policymaking tools like co-creation processes to reach diverse groups of people and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Design Thinking in Policy** Applying design thinking in policymaking involves designing the process around the people who use and serve the policy. By including all stakeholders (e.g., doctors, nurses, hospital managers, insurance companies in salary system design), people feel listened to and engaged, leading to a different outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>.
*   **Continuous Engagement** Policy design should be a continuous process where feedback is collected and fed back into the creation process, ensuring citizens feel their views are being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Humble Government** A "humble government" model involves:
    1.  Acknowledging what one doesn't know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.
    2.  Accepting limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>.
    3.  Publicly recognizing areas of uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>.
    4.  Having the humbleness to ask for help from citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. This fosters listening, asking more questions, and collaborative work over issuing orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>.

### Digitalization and Technology
*   **Digitalization as a Tool** Digitalization has greatly aided governments, such as quickly distributing benefits to those out of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. Governments can rapidly transform to operate fully digitally (e.g., in Latvia, within one week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.
*   **Inclusive Digital Tools** The challenge is to use inclusive digital tools for the benefit of everyone and to close the gap for those unable to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
*   **Empowering Public Employees** Governments should empower public employees by giving them ownership and recognizing their role in [[building_trust_in_government_response | building government]]. This involves applying design thinking internally to understand challenges public employees face in delivering services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.
*   **Developing New Skills** Public servants need to master diverse tools beyond traditional policy cycles, including big data analysis, ethnographic interviews, user experience, and quick surveys (e.g., Mentimeter, Slido) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. This requires more skills and flexibility. Technologies should support governments in reaching voices from the local communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>.

## Lessons and Future Outlook
*   **Critical Juncture** The world is at a critical moment: either return to old ways or reflect, change, and mainstream positive adaptations from the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Collaboration** There is a need for different leaders with skills in humility, flexibility, and collaboration across sectors and governmental levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>. This includes working more with citizens and involving the private sector and tech companies to generate solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.
*   **Accountability** A desired change is to hold politicians accountable for their decisions beyond their term, ensuring long-term policy vision over short-term electoral gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptation** The pandemic has highlighted problems that were previously unaddressed, offering a starting point to adapt societies to future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>.

### Innovative Tools/Experiences
*   **"1+2+4" Discussion Facilitation** A method where participants first think alone, then discuss in pairs, and finally in larger groups. This ensures individual opinions are heard and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **Empathy Maps** Stakeholder groups are asked to articulate what they believe others think about them. This unexpected perspective can be a turning point, fostering empathy and deeper understanding for further discussion and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.

[[Citizen trust and public communication | Building trust]] and more inclusive public policy tools and institutions can serve as a foundation for better services, empower citizens, and ultimately strengthen public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. The discussion emphasizes the importance of continuing this conversation and fostering deliberate action by governments and leaders to create better, inclusive, and future-oriented public governance.

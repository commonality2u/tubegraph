The concept of "seamless government" involves eliminating points of friction between the machinery of government and the citizens it serves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This approach is vital for addressing modern day [[challenges faced by governments | challenges]] and evolving expectations of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, in partnership with the UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation, regularly surfaces key global trends and case studies in public sector innovation to inspire action and replication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Driving Innovation for Seamlessness

### UAE Ministry of Possibilities
The UAE launched the Ministry of Possibilities, a virtual ministry created to incubate and solve systemic [[challenges requiring government innovation | challenges]] and "impossibles" of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This initiative aims to move beyond silo thinking and tackle wicked problems that hinder national and international progress, aligning with the UAE's Centennial Plan Vision 2071 to become the best nation by 2071 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Key aspects of the Ministry of Possibilities include:
*   **Virtual Structure** It has no single active minister but relies on time-bound departments focused on specific national priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Methodology** It applies design thinking and experimentation to develop proactive and disruptive solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Collaboration** It brings together federal, local government teams, the private sector, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[01:00:12]</a>.
*   **Mission Pillars** Its work is centered around identifying impossibles, incubating virtual time-bound departments, educating and training individuals on a design and experimentation mindset, and inspiring other governments with the UAE methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Radical Solutions** It is the first ministry focused entirely on incubating and developing radical solutions for government's most critical [[challenges and opportunities in public sector reform | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

## [[Challenges in digital government transformation | Challenges]] in Achieving Seamless Government

Implementing seamless government practices involves overcoming significant [[challenges in governmental innovation and reform | governmental innovation challenges]]:

*   **Unknown Solutions** Initiating projects with an unknown solution or envisioned end-state is challenging for government employees accustomed to certainty and clear goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Adapting to Agile Methods** Team members may find it difficult to adapt to agile working methods that focus on continuous iterations based on user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Lack of Capacity to Absorb Innovation** Governments may struggle to absorb the influx of innovative ideas, indicating a need for increased internal capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion** Governments may refrain from running risky projects due to a lack of competition, despite their role in managing risks too great for the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:24">[00:57:24]</a>.
*   **Resistance to New Approaches** There will always be some resistance when challenging existing beliefs and norms within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Equality** Many positive changes, especially those driven by technology, may not be evenly distributed, risking an expansion of knowledge or skills gaps rather than shrinking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

## Strategies for Success in Seamless Government

Several strategies can help overcome the [[challenges and strategies for digital transformation in government | challenges]] and foster seamless government:

*   **Provide a "Safe Zone" for Experimentation** Leadership must create a protected space, with legal permission, for incubation and testing, even if it deviates from current regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.
    *   `Protect those who try` is a guiding value in the Ministry of Possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **Foster Leadership Buy-in** Strong support and understanding from leadership regarding the impact and value of innovation are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.
*   **Build Partnerships** Collaborations between public and private sectors, NGOs, and social enterprises are absolutely key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.
    *   Long-standing partnerships with the tech community and hackathon organizers are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:57">[02:00:57]</a>.
*   **Embrace "Learning by Doing"** This approach allows team members to acquire new skills and adapt to new working methods over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.
*   **Focus on Value and Impact** Clearly explaining the value and impact of initiatives can bring all stakeholders, including citizens, private sector, and different government entities, on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.
*   **Challenge Norms and Seek Second Opinions** If someone claims something is impossible within government, seek a second opinion. Laws can be interpreted in multiple ways to find a path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.
*   **Cultivate an "Urgency" and "Sense of Mission"** This motivates both public and private sectors to find unexpected solutions together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:57">[02:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Invest in People and Upskilling** Broadening public literacy, particularly in areas like AI, allows for greater public engagement in policy discussions and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.
*   **Balance Ambition with Well-being** While being bold and aiming big is important, it's crucial to acknowledge the high toll continuous acceleration can take on mental health and ensure time for reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

## Outlook for the Future

The year 2020 served as a catalyst for innovation, accelerating changes that might otherwise have taken years or decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. This period underlined the importance of government and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>.

Key areas to double down on moving forward include:
*   **Continued Partnerships** Maintaining the momentum of public-private-NGO collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.
*   **Addressing Post-Crisis Issues** Focusing on areas deeply impacted by the crisis, such as mental health and accessibility to both physical and digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.
*   **Green Economy** Not forgetting commitments to environmental sustainability and a greener economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>.
*   **Trust in Science** Leveraging increased public trust in science to address major [[preparing for future challenges through government innovation | challenges]] like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>.

[!WARNING|Potential Risks]
*   **Overlooking Equality**: Innovations must be designed to be equally beneficial to all citizens to avoid expanding knowledge or skills gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>.
*   **Procedural Stagnation**: A risk exists that "innovation labs" or "dedicated ministries" might still adhere to usual procedures, dissatisfying many people. Dedication to genuinely doing things differently is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

The UAE government, for example, proactively structured a more agile and nimble government post-COVID-19, including new ministries for digital economy, artificial intelligence, and a Chief of Strategy and Government Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:39">[01:08:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:28">[01:09:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. This shows how governments can seize opportunities and accelerate long-stuck plans in the face of [[challenges and solutions in public service delivery | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is for everyone to cultivate a "small Ministry of Possibility" within themselves, fostering boldness and aiming for significant impact beyond traditional metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

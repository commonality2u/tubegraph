In a world of continuous change and increasingly complex global issues, governments are looking beyond their borders to develop solutions to global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis, in particular, accelerated digital transformation and the pace and scale of [[Public sector innovation | innovation]], while also exposing pre-existing vulnerabilities and a lack of governmental preparedness for global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. During the pandemic, [[Public sector innovation during Covid19 | public sector innovation]] emerged as a key tool to collectively address today's most pressing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Cross-Border Innovation

Despite the clear need, [[Public sector innovation | government innovation]] efforts are largely confined to national and local borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Issues facing governments are increasingly complex and transnational, requiring existing international cooperation mechanisms to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The question remains: how can governments better [[Innovation in response to crisis | innovate together]] for the public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>?

Key [[Challenges and opportunities of public sector innovation in a crisis | challenges and opportunities of public sector innovation in a crisis]] for cross-border collaboration include:
*   Cultural norms and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>
*   Lack of feedback mechanisms and learning loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>
*   Undeveloped ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>
*   Scaling of experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>

## Examples of Cross-Border Innovation

International partnerships and initiatives are demonstrating how cross-border innovation can be achieved:

*   **Deep Space Food Challenge**: An international collaboration between the Canadian Space Agency and NASA incentivizes [[Public sector innovation | innovation]] in food production technologies to meet space exploration needs, while also addressing terrestrial issues like food insecurity on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This challenge involves parallel prize competitions within legal frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.
*   **Global Innovation Collaborative**: A network and platform for collaboration where city governments worldwide launch open innovation competitions and invite innovators to deploy solutions in local testbeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This initiative, involving cities like Paris, London, New York, and Berlin, focused on COVID-19 recovery and the creative sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
*   **UAE's Government Accelerators**: This methodology aims to accelerate the execution of innovative ideas and problem-solving, often through a 100-day challenge model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>. It emphasizes empowering frontline employees and collaborative work among different entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>.
*   **UAE's Ministry of Possibilities**: The world's first virtual ministry, led by multiple ministers, provides a space to disrupt, ask difficult questions, and incubate solutions to systemic impossibilities within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>.
*   **UAE's Moonshot Apprenticeship Program**: Launched in June 2021, this program unites young minds, talents, and governments to tackle pressing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. It pairs UAE nationals with international counterparts to develop "moonshot projects" across priority sectors like data economy, global talent, and global outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>.

## Principles of Public Sector Innovation in Crisis

Several [[Principles of public sector innovation | principles of public sector innovation]] are crucial for effective crisis response and cross-border collaboration:

*   **Experimentation**: Increasingly a key mode for [[Public sector innovation | innovation]] in government, allowing ideas to become realistic solutions through testing and helping to keep risk levels manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Ground-Up Surfacing of Insights and Collective Intelligence**: Involves harvesting knowledge and ideas from anywhere, not just within traditional government structures or top universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>. This can be achieved through:
    *   Challenge initiatives and open calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>
    *   Crowdsourcing exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>
    *   Democratic citizen assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>
    *   Platforms linking farmers, teachers, etc., to mobilize brain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>
*   **Ecosystem Building**: Involves identifying and activating key players across different organizational and national boundaries. This includes:
    *   Developing legal and policy frameworks that enable innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.
    *   Establishing shared infrastructure and common platforms (e.g., Challenge.gov) to provide accessible starting points for innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>.
    *   Fostering communities of practice to connect individuals interested in specific methods or missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.
    *   Strategic budgeting that assumes success beyond initial pilots to ensure continuity and scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.
*   **Institutionalization**: For sustainable [[Impact of innovation in the public sector | impact of innovation in the public sector]], new approaches must become embedded in established roles, structures, and funding streams, similar to scientific fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.
*   **Culture of Openness and Innovation**: This is a critical success factor for projects, enabling agility and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. Creating a "cool to join" movement can foster engagement and momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:27">[01:20:27]</a>.
*   **Defining [[Roles and challenges in public sector innovation | Roles and challenges in public sector innovation]]**: Clearly defining roles and responsibilities, especially for "cross-border facilitators" or "orchestrators" who build relationships and bring people together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

## Future of Cross-Border Collaboration

The most pressing global challenges, such as climate change, pandemics, food security, water security, and unemployment, are inherently cross-border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>. They cannot be fully addressed within national boundaries, necessitating increased cross-border collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:39">[01:25:39]</a>.

This future will likely be driven by:
*   **Mini-lateralism**: Messy groupings of countries, cities, or organizations with similar problems collaborating on specific tasks, distinct from more standardized multilateral bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:49">[01:26:49]</a>.
*   **Institutionalizing Challenges**: Making social innovation challenges bigger and more linked to policymakers and procurement priorities, similar to how vaccine development has been institutionalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.
*   **Shared Foundations**: Focus on common standards, better data usage, and shared methodologies for design and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>.
*   **Mobilizing Creativity**: Governments must learn to harness and orchestrate collective intelligence that exists broadly in society, rather than letting valuable resources dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>.

The transition towards an era of more systematic and structured collaboration, using tools like the internet, is expected to be more transformational than many specific technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>.

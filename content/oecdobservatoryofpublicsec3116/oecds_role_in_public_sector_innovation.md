From: [[oecdobservatoryofpublicsec3116]] <br/> 

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) plays a significant role in advancing [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] globally, primarily through its secretariat of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] (OPSI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The OECD aims to take the concept of a declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] to a global level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## The Draft Declaration on [[Public Sector Innovation]]

The OECD is currently managing a public consultation process for a draft declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. This declaration is intended to serve as a common agreement at the international level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. The draft declaration was launched at an OPSI conference in Paris in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>, with the public consultation closing on February 22nd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

The declaration aims to:
*   Help bring countries together in their efforts towards [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.
*   Signal that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is a crucial part of how governments operate, not just an add-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
*   Facilitate a more sophisticated conversation about [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
*   Codify language to tell a richer story about why [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.
*   Highlight that all [[public_sector_innovation | public servants]] have a role in [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
*   Emphasize the need for new partnerships and diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
*   Recognize that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is an evolving practice, requiring continuous learning and sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

While the declaration is hoped to become an official OECD instrument, it is not legally binding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Its purpose is to allow member countries to affirm their commitment to the ideals of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and draw upon its ideas to inform their [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.

### Public Consultation Feedback
The OECD welcomes feedback on the draft declaration from individuals, organizations, groups, or countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. Useful contributions include:
*   Identifying what makes sense or does not make sense in the text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.
*   Suggesting alternative wording or explanations for unclear terms (e.g., "weak signals") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   Providing insights on terminology that may differ in cultural contexts (e.g., "civil servant" vs. "public servant") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
*   Commenting on the usefulness or feasibility of proposed actions or activities within specific country contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.
*   Highlighting implications of directives, such as auditing considerations for experimentation and failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

## Key Principles and Collaborations

The OECD's approach to [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] is heavily based on its work with countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. This includes detailed studies, such as the one conducted with the Public Service of Canada on their [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

### [[Facets of Public Sector Innovation]]
The OECD has introduced the concept of [[facets_of_public_sector_innovation | innovation facets]] to foster a more accessible language around [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>, recognizing its multifaceted nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. These facets include:
*   **Enhancement-oriented [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]**: Improving existing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]**: Achieving ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Adaptive [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]**: Responding to a changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]**: Engaging with weak signals early to shape change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

Governments are encouraged to maintain a portfolio approach to [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], hedging their bets across these [[facets_of_public_sector_innovation | facets]] to be ready for emerging challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

### Citizen Participation and Leadership
The OECD emphasizes that citizen participation is a crucial part of an effective [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>, relying on understanding diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. They also conduct ongoing work on leadership and skills required to develop [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] competency and capability within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

### Engagement Across Government Levels
While the OECD primarily engages with national governments, it is also interested in the perspectives of local governments and local [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. [[Public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] is viewed from an ecosystem perspective, recognizing that no single level or body of government can successfully address all challenges alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.

## Next Steps

Following the public consultation, the draft declaration will be proposed to the Public Governance Committee within the OECD for further consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. The ultimate aim is for countries to use the declaration to inspire the management of diverse [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] strategies and to reflect on their systems to better support [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

Governments worldwide are increasingly expected to enhance their capacity to anticipate the future and collaborate to address global challenges by continuously identifying, testing, and implementing innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>. This requires a shift towards proactive governance, integrating future thinking, foresight, and innovation into the core operating system of public sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:34">[01:25:34]</a>.

## The Role of Anticipatory Innovation Governance

Recent global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, and high inflation, highlight the unclear and misty future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These crises present an opportunity to build more resilient public sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Citizens rely on the public sector as a cornerstone during difficult situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

[[Anticipatory Innovation Governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] (AIG) is essential for public administration, as citizens turn to governments when change occurs and crises hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. AIG involves creating knowledge about the future and making decisions based on that knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. It's about taking action today towards future outlooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. This requires:
*   A governance system that supports innovating today towards future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   Agency in governments to use tools and methods to understand the future, explore alternatives, and translate insights into innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   An authorizing environment with feedback systems, evaluation of policies for future readiness, stress testing, and legitimacy in considering different scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

Complexity can be managed with the right decision-making and cooperative systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. Anticipation is not an extra layer but an essential driver for public sector effectiveness, deeply embedded in the culture of modern public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>.

## Finland's Pioneering Work

Finland is undergoing one of the biggest public sector transformations, including the creation of welfare counties, a new level of public governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Finland aims to take concrete steps to shift towards [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | proactive governance]] at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. They plan to take the first necessary steps in the next government term, viewing this as a marathon rather than a sprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

Finland's collaboration with the OECD has focused on improving [[anticipatory_innovation_governance_framework | anticipatory innovation governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. The findings from this project will serve as a blueprint for other EU member states, helping public administrations plan and adapt better to evolutions and be more prepared for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

Key takeaways from Finland's work:
*   Increasing the capacity of civil servants to reflect on future policy challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   Creating long-term planning for short-term democracies through revised policy-making and budgetary processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   Fostering better dialogue between politicians and public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

The Finnish model analyzes the system based on [[anticipatory_innovation_governance_framework | anticipatory innovation governance]] mechanisms, considering both the agency of public servants and their authorizing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. While Finland has an advanced system, there are still areas for improvement to integrate strategic positive futures into the policy-making value chain and enable civil servants to explore alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

Finland's work includes:
*   Developing a framework to assess anticipatory capacity in governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   Conducting action research and pilots in areas like continuous learning, carbon neutrality, child well-being, and dialogues on the roles of politicians and administrative staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   Updating the [[anticipatory_innovation_governance_framework | anticipatory innovation governance framework]] to identify where additional anticipatory elements should be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

Challenges identified include organizational, individual, and procedural hindering anticipation and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. The work focuses on how to make anticipatory innovation more democratic, integrate anticipatory knowledge into budgets and investments, explore alternatives, build individual and organizational capacities, and cross policy cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## The Role of Citizens

[[Role of citizen participation in innovation | Citizen participation]] is a core component of the anticipatory approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Governments are not pursuing [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipatory innovation for governments]] solely for internal efficiency but for the benefit of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. It's crucial for citizens to be involved, with opportunities throughout the policy cycle to discuss not only immediate issues but also future anticipatory concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This involvement allows for the integration of citizen knowledge and addresses their growing demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

[[Public participation and trust in urban governance | Being proactive rather than reactive]] to future challenges builds [[public_participation_and_trust_in_urban_governance | trust]] and resilience in both government and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Research shows that citizens' trust in government's ability to innovate is directly linked to their overall trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

Finland is testing new [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | National Dialogue models]] to involve citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Portugal's "2050 lab" project is another example of a participatory visioning initiative, deeply connecting with civil society and citizens to imagine future possibilities for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Directions

The challenges facing European administrations are increasingly complex, including super wicked problems like climate change and black swan events like COVID-19, set against a backdrop of multi-level governance and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. Key challenges include:
*   The unprecedented speed of technological change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   The impact of demographic changes and increasing skills shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   The increasing complexity of managing policy issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   The impact and importance of the [[Citizen Participation in the Green Transition | green transition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   Increased competition for limited public funding, requiring prioritization, leadership, and innovative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

A primary challenge for public administrations is building resilience, which comes from stable and efficient processes delivering quality services and policies, alongside a capacity for disruption to challenge, innovate, adapt, and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

To equip civil servants with tools for future-oriented innovation and experimentation, various approaches are used:
*   Providing toolboxes and resources for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   Sharing cases and good examples to build capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   Developing future literacy and targeted programs for leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   Creating a culture that promotes and integrates foresight and innovation into daily practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   Capacity building and reinforcing skills across institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
*   Building communities and networks that allow for information sharing and cross-cutting collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

Continuity of long-term reforms across government terms is vital, as is a systematic approach to anticipating and addressing emerging issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. It's also important to bridge silos between foresight systems, innovation systems, and normal policy-making to ensure a value chain of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

The Conference on the Future of Europe is a large-scale democratic and participatory exercise with a strong deliberative dimension, focusing on the future of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">01:16:16</a>. It is being hosted in partnership between the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation and the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">00:00:18</a>. Additional support comes from the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA) and the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">00:00:31</a>.

## Aims and Structure

The conference aims to facilitate a broader shift in the relationship between government and citizens through various democratic innovations at local to international levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">00:01:14</a>. It particularly seeks to change the relationship citizens have with EU institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">00:15:45</a>.

The Conference on the Future of Europe relies on "three Ps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">00:18:26</a>:
*   **Platform** A multilingual digital platform for individual contributions and reports from local events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">00:18:32</a>.
*   **Panels** Four European Citizens' Panels, each with 200 randomly selected citizens who meet over three weekends to reflect on the future of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">00:16:21</a>. These panels are seen as effective in producing interesting results and showcasing the richness of diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">00:16:47</a>. National and regional citizens' panels are also taking place in member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">00:17:47</a>.
*   **Plenary** An assembly mixing 80 citizens from the European Citizens' Panels with politicians from national parliaments, European parliaments, governments, and local authorities, along with civil society representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">00:19:01</a>. This format is considered highly innovative for fostering interaction and serving as an intermediary step in participatory processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">00:19:29</a>.

A key aspect is the transnational dimension, involving translation into all European languages and bringing people together from across European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">00:19:50</a>.

## Evaluation and Impact

### Perceived Strengths and Hopes
*   **Empowering Citizens**: The conference is intentionally designed to put citizens at its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">00:33:17</a>. The agenda for the plenary is set by recommendations from citizens, and citizens' components provide spokespersons for working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">00:33:39</a>.
*   **Cultural Change**: There is a belief that the conference marks a significant cultural shift, proving that these processes work and are enthusiastically received by participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">00:35:00</a>.
*   **Future Tools**: It is anticipated that the conference will lead to more permanent tools for meaningful citizen participation within the European Union's toolbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">00:35:34</a>.
*   **Political Will**: There is a growing realization among politicians that inaction poses a higher political risk than allowing change to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">00:34:38</a>.
*   **Media Role**: For these processes to be impactful, visibility is crucial, as media attention can pressure politicians to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">01:10:48</a>. A cultural shift is needed in the media to focus on innovative and peaceful democratic interactions, not just conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">01:10:30</a>.

### Concerns and Challenges
*   **Lack of Mandate/Real Power**: A significant fear is that citizens participating might be disappointed or let down because their contributions are seen as a "one-off" conversation rather than leading to a long-lasting relationship or real power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">00:30:40</a>. There's a question of whether EU institutions truly trust citizens and are willing to put meaningful power in their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">00:28:15</a>.
*   **Uncertain Follow-up**: While the founding documents and political speeches emphasize follow-up, the exact form and timing of how proposals will be translated into actual initiatives and subjected to accountability remain unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">00:32:46</a>. There's a concern that it might remain a "recommendation" that politicians can choose to implement or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">00:37:27</a>.
*   **Risk of Frustration**: If proposals are completely ignored or processes don't inspire public confidence, they could do more harm than good, leading to citizen frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">00:39:02</a>. The "no filter" concept in France's Climate Convention, where recommendations were not all taken on board, led to public disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">00:51:21</a>.
*   **Cherry-Picking Recommendations**: There is a risk that policymakers might "cherry-pick" recommendations, selecting only those already foreseen in policy, which undermines the genuine impact of citizen input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">01:01:43</a>.
*   **Pace of Change**: While progress is being made, some believe the institutional change is happening too slowly, and these "one-off" projects might be used to political advantage rather than driving fundamental shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">01:01:07</a>.
*   **Clarity on Expectations**: It is important to clearly explain to citizens that these processes are not direct democracy and that not all recommendations will be adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">00:50:30</a>. Committing to a percentage of follow-up could provide a clearer metric for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">00:51:49</a>.
*   **Digital vs. Physical Engagement**: While digital platforms are crucial, the importance of physical democratic spaces and face-to-face interaction for human communication and relationship building is emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">00:23:57</a>. The increasing time spent on screens and the privatization of public digital spaces (e.g., Zoom, Twitter, Facebook) can lead to a "digital feudalism" where user data fuels digital capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">00:46:06</a>.
*   **Power Dynamics**: The core issue is the shifting of power from existing institutions and structures to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">00:28:06</a>. It requires governments to trust citizens and meaningfully empower them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">00:28:15</a>.

## Moving Forward

The Conference on the Future of Europe represents a "birthing pain" in the transition from purely representative democracy to one where citizens demand a greater role in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">00:54:01</a>. It is seen as a new form of representation where participants act as citizen representatives, necessitating a redesign of representative democracy rather than its replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">00:54:31</a>.

Key commitments and ideas for the future include:
*   **Building Trust**: Continually working to build trust, especially for governments to trust their citizens more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">01:00:58</a>.
*   **People-Centered Solutions**: Shifting from expert-based solutions to people-centered solutions by involving citizens at all stages of policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">01:08:47</a>. This involves identifying user groups, analyzing their needs through direct interaction, interpreting solutions with them, and iterative testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">01:08:52</a>.
*   **Democratic Fitness**: Strengthening people's "democratic muscles" through practice and training, fostering agency and political efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">00:11:31</a>. This involves making democracy more active, playful, and accessible, moving it from a lecture room to a practical arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">01:13:06</a>.
*   **New Language for Impact**: Developing a broader language to define democratic impact beyond just legislation or politics, encompassing trust-building, network strengthening, inspiration, engagement, and shared vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">00:56:58</a>.
*   **"Yes And" Approach**: Embracing opportunities for citizen involvement even if not perfect, recognizing that taking offered power can lead to a virtuous cycle of more power being offered and taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">00:43:00</a>.
*   **Role of Private Sector**: Recognizing the role of entrepreneurs and the private sector in driving democratic innovation and bridging the gap between public sector and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">01:12:17</a>.
*   **Physical Spaces**: Supporting physical democratic spaces where different "silos of democracy" can meet and build solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">01:13:27</a>.
*   **Honesty and Transparency**: Being honest about the scope of citizens' influence: "say what you do and do what you say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">01:02:18</a>.

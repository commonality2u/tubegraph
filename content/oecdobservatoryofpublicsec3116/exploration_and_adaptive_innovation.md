Innovation is influenced by two key variables: whether the activity is directed towards a known need or is non-directed, and the degree to which the process is radical or incremental (i.e., how uncertain the process is) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This distinction can also be framed as whether innovation is focused on exploration or exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Exploration vs. Exploitation

*   **Exploitation** involves utilizing existing ideas and applying them in new contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Exploration** is about creating new ideas during the innovation process itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Innovation can be exploratory, focusing on exploring and adapting to new situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

These two angles—the presence or absence of direction, and the level of uncertainty versus calculated risks—define different facets of public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Adaptive Innovation

[[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]] is a type of innovation characterized by an exploratory activity where there is no clear predetermined direction for where the innovation is headed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. In this approach, innovators explore new ideas through trial practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Other Types of Innovation

Depending on these variables, other areas of public sector innovation emerge:

*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation** occurs when innovation is connected to a directed, purpose-filled activity, such as solving specific problems like homelessness, poverty, or climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   [[Anticipatory_Innovation | **Anticipatory Innovation**]] is relevant when a situation involves deep uncertainty, exploration of new ideas, and the expectation of radical transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. It involves working on ideas that could be quite radical to existing systems, anticipating future transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   [[transformative_and_enhancement_oriented_innovation | **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation**]] focuses on improving systems that are already in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

All four of these key areas of public sector innovation require different approaches to direction, strategy, capacity, and allowance for innovation to occur within [[government_innovation_and_adaptation | government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

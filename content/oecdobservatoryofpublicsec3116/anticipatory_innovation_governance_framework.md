The [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] framework is currently in a development phase [00:01:01]. The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) team, including Piret (Senior Project Manager), Angela Hansen (Lead of Tools and Methods), Joshua Poultry (Lead on Strategic Foresight and Embedment Methodologies), Chiara (focusing on [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] at organizational levels), and Heather Bruceman (working on country and regional projects), is actively developing and discussing this framework [00:01:30]-[00:02:29], having worked on the topic for approximately two years [00:06:05].

## Origins and Rationale

The concept of [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] began to be discussed in late 2018 [00:06:27], even before the current global crisis [00:07:38]. The initial support for this work came from Sweden and Vinnova, Sweden's leading innovation agency [00:06:18]-[00:06:50]. Vinnova opened its doors for analysis of its innovation portfolio and provided "seed thinking" for what [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] should entail [00:06:53]-[00:07:08]. Sweden is recognized as a key partner in developing the anticipatory functions of government [00:07:20]-[00:07:25].

This framework addresses the inherent volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and novelty present in the world today [00:07:45]-[00:07:50]. Governments and public organizations face complex problems and new developments (technological and otherwise) that require an adequate response [00:07:53]-[00:08:12]. The goal is for governments to be prepared or to define the desired future [00:08:14]-[00:08:23], which necessitates anticipation [00:08:26]-[00:08:28].

### The Innovator's Dilemma in Public Service

A core reason to anticipate is due to the "innovator's dilemma," a concept known since the 1990s [00:10:22]-[00:10:25]. Established practices, government structures, and policies are not meant to last forever as external conditions change and new ideas emerge, rendering old systems less relevant [00:10:29]-[00:10:53].

Challenges in incorporating new, disruptive information include:
*   **Stakeholder Feedback**: Current stakeholders, accustomed to existing services, may provide feedback that doesn't reflect future needs or potential innovations [00:11:03]-[00:11:27]. Early-stage new ideas often underperform existing ones, leading to misleading feedback from mainstream users [00:11:46]-[00:12:04].
*   **Strategic Intent**: An organization's current strategic intent can work against incorporating anticipatory information [00:12:06]-[00:12:15]. Leadership's focus on immediate challenges can divert attention from upcoming risks or opportunities [00:12:21]-[00:12:33].
*   **Resistance to Change**: Organizations are comfortable with current performance and resist dramatic shifts [00:12:35]-[00:12:45]. However, ignoring new transformations can lead to irrelevance, as seen with companies like Canon and Nokia [00:12:47]-[00:12:57].

### The Collingridge Dilemma and Technology

Public sectors face a unique challenge, often referred to as the "Collingridge dilemma," particularly concerning technological developments [00:13:44]-[00:13:49]. The ability to control technological change is much greater in its early phases, but evidence of potential impacts is low [00:13:51]-[00:14:11]. As an innovation develops and evidence of its impact grows, the ability to control it diminishes [00:14:13]-[00:14:16].

An example is Uber: influencing its development was possible in the early phases of the platform economy, but once millions of users adopted it, rolling back time became difficult, even when adverse effects (like climate change or emissions) became clear [00:14:20]-[00:15:04]. This implies that governments must consider both technological and non-technological changes early on to influence outcomes aligned with their values [00:15:06]-[00:15:17]. This necessity highlights a need for a different approach to creating evidence and experimenting in government, rather than maintaining a "wait and see" position [00:15:26]-[00:15:32].

### Moving Beyond Static Futures

Governments and organizations often view the future from a static perspective, using traditional "futures cones" for strategy development [00:15:52]-[00:15:57]. While concepts like preferable, plausible, and possible futures are influential and important, they cannot be treated as one-off exercises [00:16:01]-[00:16:17]. Developing a strategy for five or ten years based on a single futures exercise is insufficient because the future is dynamic [00:16:17]-[00:16:31]. Relying on a few scenarios means "five different ways of being wrong" [00:16:35]-[00:16:40].

Instead, [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] and strategic foresight require a continuous practice to be impactful [00:16:40]-[00:16:50]. Futures are created through "present dialogue" and continuous conversation among different people [00:16:54]-[00:17:03]. By discussing and acting on preferable futures in the present, organizations actively influence and create that future [00:17:06]-[00:17:22]. This means taking action, experimenting, and developing ideas in the present to test possibilities and avoid being caught off guard [00:17:34]-[00:17:58].

## Distinction and Relationship with Strategic Foresight

[[anticipatory_innovation_and_foresight | Strategic foresight]] is a crucial component of [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipating innovation]] [01:04:02]-[01:04:05]. It provides vital input by looking at signals, sensing upcoming changes, reading weak signals, and validating strong ones [01:04:05]-[01:04:14]. This knowledge needs to be integrated into long-term government objectives, planning, and strategy [01:04:14]-[01:04:22].

However, a significant challenge is the "impact gap" or "implementation gap" [01:04:22]-[01:04:26], where insights from strategic foresight are often ignored [01:04:26]-[01:21:40]. Reasons for this gap include:
*   **Undesirable Information**: Strategic foresight can produce information that questions current practices, making it undesirable to those committed to the status quo [01:04:46]-[01:05:01].
*   **Lack of Enforcement**: Without mechanisms to enforce the uptake of foresight insights into concrete actions or implementation, they are easily ignored [01:05:02]-[01:05:13].
*   **Siloing**: [[anticipatory_innovation_and_foresight | Strategic foresight]] tends to be siloed within governments, creating an impact gap in translating information into practice [01:05:15]-[01:05:22].
*   **Practitioner Behavior**: Practitioners must design engagements for implementers, not just for their own satisfaction [01:05:23]-[01:05:29]. A common rule suggests spending one-third of time on generating ideas and two-thirds on implementation and enabling structures [01:05:32]-[01:05:40].
*   **Organizational Culture**: Factors like silos, change fatigue, lack of participation, and the belief that governments control innovation can hinder the uptake of foresight [01:05:43]-[01:06:05].

A prominent example of this impact gap is the global pandemic. Despite foresight communities forecasting global pandemics (e.g., in the US and UK) as early as 2017, these were often treated as one risk among many, leading to little proactive action [01:06:07]-[01:06:21]. This resulted in a reactive, tactical response in 2020 instead of strategic anticipation and capability building [01:06:21]-[01:06:36].

## Core Definitions

The framework clarifies key terms:
*   **Anticipation**: The creation of knowledge about the future, drawing from existing contextual factors, underlying values, worldviews, assumptions, and emerging developments [01:06:01]-[01:06:13]. It's an ongoing act connected to the potentiality and possibility of the future [01:06:14]-[01:06:16].
*   **Innovation**: Acting upon that knowledge to innovate the system (process, service, product) and exploring alternative futures to influence the future [01:06:17]-[01:06:23]. It moves beyond a "wait and see" position to actively shaping a preferable future [01:06:24]-[01:06:33].
*   **Governance**: A system of structures, institutions, agencies, and the environment that supports the activity of anticipation and innovation [01:06:34]-[01:06:40]. This addresses the inability of governments to test critical, contradictory, or transformative ideas that go beyond current paradigms [01:06:40]-[01:06:48].

## Beyond Resilience and Adaptation

While interconnected, [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] is distinct from resilience and adaptive capacity:
*   **Resilience**: Aims to make a system more prepared for external shocks, allowing it to expand without breaking while upholding core values and properties [01:06:50]-[01:07:07]. It's about enduring and recovering [01:07:07]-[01:07:11]. However, anticipation can reveal when resilience is insufficient and fundamental change is needed [01:07:12]-[01:07:22]. The OECD defines resilience as a system's ability "to prepare, absorb, recover, and adapt in the event of a disruption" [01:07:12]-[01:07:22]. It can be part of an overall strategy, often talks about system performance, but doesn't define what's worth preserving [01:07:23]-[01:07:33].
*   **Adaptive/Agile Capacity**: Refers to the government's ability to respond tactically and adaptively to innovation during crises [01:07:22]-[01:07:26]. This involves acting without extensive knowledge, testing possibilities quickly, and adapting to ongoing changes, with little room for strategic thinking [01:07:27]-[01:07:36].

[[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] strengthens both resilient and adaptive capacities [01:07:37]-[01:07:40]. It ensures that while enhancing the system, pursuing missions, or adapting to changes, organizations question if they are heading in the right direction, dealing with the right challenges, and if systems need fundamental change [01:07:41]-[01:07:56]. It helps prevent getting "locked into" current activities and enables timely change [01:07:57]-[01:08:05].

## Building an [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] System

The framework identifies two key sides to building an [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] capacity:
1.  **Agency to Anticipate and Innovate**: Building a value chain from anticipatory knowledge to innovation. This involves components that address vested interests and cognitive biases, public participation, networks, skills, and capacities [01:29:12]-[01:30:06].
2.  **Authorizing Environment**: A feedback system providing data, measurement, learning groups, and evidence to assess the ideas being explored [01:30:06]-[01:30:27].

These components play out differently depending on the system (e.g., a top-heavy or centrally aligned innovation system) [01:30:31]-[01:30:58].

Experienced government foresight practitioners, particularly in [[anticipatory_innovation_governance_in_finland | Finland]], identify five system elements crucial for building [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] capacity [01:39:47]-[01:40:15]:
1.  **Demand**: Cultivating a leadership culture that actively seeks strategic foresight and [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] [01:40:17]-[01:40:27].
2.  **Capacity**: Developing the knowledge and skills within government, such as having horizon scanners and scenario planners [01:40:30]-[01:40:41].
3.  **Embeddedness**: Aligning system elements like electoral cycles and policy reviews with anticipatory activities [01:40:43]-[01:40:54]. It's crucial to know in advance how, when, and by whom anticipatory activities will be implemented to prevent them from "going to die" [01:41:01]-[01:41:15].
4.  **Institutions and Teams**: Establishing specific institutions and teams responsible for [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] that connect with the wider world and those who will act on their discoveries [01:41:17]-[01:41:41].
5.  **Feedback**: Implementing systems for evaluating how well anticipation was used and identifying areas for improvement [01:41:44]-[01:41:55].

### Case Studies

*   **Finland**: Possesses one of the most advanced strategic foresight systems in government [01:47:17]-[01:47:19]. Multiple teams and institutions across ministries and the Prime Minister's Office, including a parliamentary committee and a community uniting government, non-government, academia, and research organizations, work in concert, timing activities with policy and electoral cycles [01:42:02]-[01:42:32]. Their challenge lies in translating foresight knowledge into decision-making and innovative processes, where alternatives are explored and tested [01:47:21]-[01:47:34].
*   **Helsingborg, Sweden**: This city consciously decided to become an [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory organization]] [01:48:56]-[01:49:03]. Their journey began by building leadership capacity among city managers and political representatives to discuss future and anticipatory issues [01:49:10]-[01:49:39]. This led to decisions to support [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] projects as test beds for the future [01:49:44]-[01:49:51].
*   **Ireland**: The OECD is working with the Irish government to understand and outline the roles needed within their system for [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] to function effectively [01:57:22]-[01:58:02].
*   **Slovenia**: Collaborating with the Slovenian government on specific topics for the European Union presidency, such as the future of the public sector, talent management, and aging [01:57:58]-[01:58:12].
*   **Latvia**: Working on building and managing [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory ecosystems]] around different technologies from a public sector perspective [01:58:13]-[01:58:29].

### Leadership and Culture

Leadership interest in [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] is crucial [01:50:49]-[01:50:51]. However, leadership faces political risk and accountability for things going wrong, while less accountability exists for missed opportunities [01:51:30]-[01:51:48]. It takes a special kind of leader to be open-minded enough to welcome insights that challenge existing assumptions or indicate that current practices might be wrong [01:52:26]-[01:52:39].

Biases that need addressing include:
*   **Expert Bias**: Over-reliance on existing expertise [01:52:46].
*   **"Minimal Squeak" Behavior**: Tendency to ignore problems that aren't immediate crises to avoid responsibility for solving them [01:52:50]-[01:53:19].
*   **Linear Thinking**: Desire to present policy problems as linear and predictable, with experts having all the answers [01:53:21]-[01:53:36].

Leadership models should evolve to account for uncertainty [01:53:41]-[01:53:50]. Wider culture and politics also set constraints; the public often demands leaders have all the answers and be solely responsible for the future, which is an unreasonable but common expectation [01:54:10]-[01:54:45]. It's crucial to recognize that "uncertainty is here to stay" [01:54:52]-[01:54:56].

For an organization to have [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory capacity]], one might look for:
*   A process or deliverable exploring potential future developments [01:55:50]-[01:55:53].
*   Engagement where senior management listens to alternatives [01:55:55]-[01:56:00].
*   A person or team dedicated to developing alternative futures [01:56:01]-[01:56:06].
*   A person or team whose job it is to propose doing things differently [01:56:07]-[01:56:12].

### Relationship with Mission-Oriented Innovation

[[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] complements mission-driven innovation, which is led by a single purpose, such as achieving Paris Agreement goals or decarbonizing an economy by a set deadline [01:20:09]-[01:20:45]. Missions are activating tools that legitimize innovation towards a clear goal [01:20:48]-[01:21:09].

However, even with clear missions, [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] is important for:
*   **Unexpected Solutions**: Identifying new technological solutions that might be more successful than planned ones [01:21:29]-[01:21:37].
*   **Side Effects**: Anticipating the ripple effects or unintended consequences of mission-driven changes (e.g., job displacement from green transitions) [01:21:40]-[01:22:23].

It ensures organizations are not "locked in" to a single path and are prepared for potential new challenges arising from achieving their missions [01:22:04]-[01:22:23].

## Measurement in Anticipatory Innovation

A core challenge for [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] is making decisions and taking actions without traditional evidence [01:24:32]-[01:24:36]. [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] requires a different type of measurement and evaluation system than standard public sector approaches [01:24:39]-[01:24:47].

## Future Work and Resources

The OECD is releasing a preliminary overview of the [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] concept and a working paper on the theoretical level, which will include numerous references to global work and methodologies [01:06:33]-[01:07:11]. The team is actively exploring mechanisms to build agency for [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] and an authorizing environment that supports and evaluates this work [01:07:14]-[01:07:33].

Upcoming events and projects include:
*   **Government Aftershock**: A conference held on November 17-18, addressing issues from the recent crisis and discussing the future of the public sector [01:25:00]-[01:25:12].
*   **Designing an [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]] Starter Kit**: A session with Lavax from Portugal [01:25:17]-[01:25:23].
*   **Discussions with Demos Helsinki**: On changes in [[anticipatory_innovation_governance_in_finland | Finland]] [01:25:56]-[01:26:00].
*   **RSA (UK) Sessions**: On the art of change and building for the future [01:26:08]-[01:26:11].
*   **Nido (Belgium) and other partners**: Discussing innovation as a driving force and future committees [01:26:14]-[01:26:25].
*   **High-Level Forum Discussions**: Including Oliver Kahanen (Deputy Secretary Industry, Singapore) and Darya Isaksson (Sweden) on governing towards future outcomes [01:26:42]-[01:26:57].
*   **Tools and Methods Discussion**: On managing complexity, portfolio systems, and anticipation [01:27:05]-[01:27:12].

A comprehensive portfolio of content will be released by the end of the year, with deep work continuing over the next two years [01:08:54]-[01:09:03].

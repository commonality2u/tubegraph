[[Public sector innovation | Innovation]] in general is influenced by two crucial variables: whether the activity is directed or non-directed, and the degree to which the process is radical or incremental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These variables help define different facets of [[Public Sector Innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Key Variables of Innovation

1.  **Direction (Directed vs. Non-Directed)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>
    *   **Directed Activity:** Innovation is focused on solving a specific problem, such as homelessness, poverty, or climate change, with a clear mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
    *   **Non-Directed Activity:** Innovation involves exploring and adapting to new situations, where ideas emerge from creative thinking without a pre-defined purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  **Uncertainty (Radical vs. Incremental)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
    *   This variable determines how uncertain the innovation process is, or if risks can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
    *   It can be described as balancing exploration versus exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
        *   **Exploitation:** Using already existing ideas in new contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
        *   **Exploration:** Creating new ideas in the process itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Facets of [[Public Sector Innovation | Public Sector Innovation]]

Depending on the interplay of direction and uncertainty, four key areas of [[Public Sector Innovation | public sector innovation]] emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>:

*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation:** Occurs when innovation is tied to a directed, purpose-filled activity, aiming to solve significant societal missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This concept has been developed by Mariana Mazzucato at UCL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **[[Adaptive innovation in public services | Adaptive Innovation]]:** Characterized by exploration activities without a clear direction, where innovators discover new ideas through their daily practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **[[Anticipatory Innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]]:** Emerges in situations of deep uncertainty, involving the exploration of new ideas and the expectation of radical transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This form of innovation involves anticipating future transformations and developing ideas that might be quite radical to existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation:** Focuses on improving and enhancing systems that are already established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

All these areas of [[Public Sector Innovation | public sector innovation]] require different strategic approaches, capacities, and an environment that allows for innovation within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

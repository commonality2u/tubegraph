[[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] is recognized as a driving force of change, though sometimes it requires an external push for innovation [00:00:05] [00:00:10]. To address this, the Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) collaborated with the European Commission to establish the Innovation Incubator program [00:00:12].

## The Innovation Incubator Program

The Innovation Incubator program assists countries in exploring more radical innovations and anticipating future changes [00:00:20]. Denmark, Romania, and Portugal participated in its pilot phase [00:00:26]. The incubator provides these countries with international expert advice, peer support, and co-design elements [00:00:34].

### Anticipatory Innovation

A key focus of the incubator is anticipatory innovation, which enables governments to take future-oriented action [00:00:39]. This proactive stance helps governments address societal challenges [00:00:43]. Under the incubator's guidance, Portugal developed the Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit [00:00:50]. This kit is designed for public servants and managers who are new to anticipatory innovation, aiming to make it easy to understand, assess, and use [00:00:55].

## Collaboration and Dissemination of Innovation

Sharing experiences among innovators is crucial for mutual learning and for disseminating positive contributions to the wider community [00:01:08]. OPSI has formed a [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation | partnership]] with Accelerate Estonia to help disseminate lessons learned from the Innovation Incubator experience [00:01:16].

### Accelerate Estonia: A Model for Public-Private Collaboration

Accelerate Estonia is an entity that aims to "accelerate Estonia" by identifying societal problems and transforming them into opportunities through [[partnerships_between_public_sector_and_private_sector_for_innovation | public private partnerships]] [00:01:21] [00:01:27]. OPSI and Accelerate Estonia have developed tools for incubating innovation projects [00:01:36]. These tools are accessible to governments on OPSI's website, where they can be adapted to unique local contexts [00:01:40].

## OPSI's Role

OPSI functions as the global forum for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] [00:01:47]. Its mission is to support governments in understanding, testing, and embedding new initiatives that respond to societal challenges [00:01:49]. This ultimately aims to ensure that improved services and policies contribute to better lives for citizens [00:01:56].

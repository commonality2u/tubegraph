[[Innovation portfolio management | Innovation portfolio management]] in the public sector is an emerging practice crucial for navigating global crises and their ripple effects, which have highlighted existing gaps and the need for more systemic approaches to [[public sector innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The Observatory of [[Public Sector Innovation | Public Sector Innovation]], in collaboration with the European Commission, focuses on how portfolio approaches can support recovery efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Defining Innovation Portfolios in the Public Sector

While "portfolio management" can mean different things, especially in financial sectors, this discussion specifically focuses on [[innovation portfolio management | innovation portfolios]] within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A key distinction is that private sector [[innovation portfolio management | innovation portfolios]] often have a single underlying bottom line, making direction setting clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. In contrast, public sector returns and [[impact of innovation in the public sector | impact]] are notoriously difficult to measure and evaluate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

A portfolio approach involves deploying many different innovations simultaneously in connected ways. It seeks to choose diverse solutions in relation to an overarching intent and connect them as they happen on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. This means embracing numerous examples, addressing various intervention points like acupuncture points in a complex system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

## The Rationale for Innovation Portfolios

Global crises have underscored that either more or different [[types of public sector innovation | types of innovation]] are needed, and that [[public sector innovation | innovation]] efforts should work more systemically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. They have also highlighted the crucial role [[public sector innovation | public sector]] organizations could and should play in shaping these efforts within ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

[[Innovation portfolio management | Portfolio approaches]] are considered the most effective mechanism for handling extreme complexity and uncertainty, especially in challenges like climate change, which require radical societal transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. They are well-suited for accelerating learning, deploying [[public sector innovation | innovation]], and connecting policy with learning through experimental and experiential approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

Public sector organizations are grappling with complex challenges that traditional planning tools, designed for predictability, have struggled to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. [[Innovation portfolio management | Portfolio approaches]] offer a space to acknowledge this frustration and open up new ways to make decisions, acting as a multiplier by injecting a learning approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## Key Insights and Practices

The Observatory of [[Public Sector Innovation | Public Sector Innovation]]'s research has identified several insights regarding [[innovation portfolio management | innovation portfolios]]:

*   **Mapping Generates Insight** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>: The very act of collectively mapping a portfolio generates "aha moments" and collective intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Prompt for Interrogation and Direction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>: Mapping alone is insufficient; the portfolio must prompt collective interrogation and direction setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Analysis needs to lead to action, or it remains a "pretty visual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Sustained Activity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>: Portfolio mapping and direction setting are not one-time activities but must be sustained with dedicated capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Human-Centric Management** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>: Portfolios are created and managed by humans working in organizations, each with their own interests and logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. To drive [[public sector innovation | innovation]] holistically, the [[public sector innovation | public sector]]'s role in the ecosystem of actors must be clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Facilitating Elements

A poll of participants indicated that the most important facilitating elements for successful [[innovation portfolio management | portfolio approaches to innovation]] are:
*   Looking for relationships, connections, and combinations among diverse [[types of public sector innovation | innovation]] initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
*   Recognition of complexity and uncertainty in addressing change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   Keeping options open to iterate and learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
These elements are interconnected, highlighting the need for systemic thinking to deal with complex adaptive system challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

### Practical Introduction in the Public Sector

Introducing [[innovation portfolio management | portfolio approaches]] in the public sector can be aided by:
1.  **Recognizing the Implementation Gap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>: There's a significant gap between policy commitments and individual innovations; connecting these disparate efforts requires sustained, systematic work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
2.  **Agreeing on Intent, Not Just Objectives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>: Focus on a common, shared commitment and vision for transformation, acknowledging that the destination may be unclear. This involves learning by doing and requires time for actors to agree on this intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
3.  **Creating a Visual and Contextual Frame** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>: Develop a visual and systemic frame that helps people see how different initiatives (e.g., transport, community gardens, healthcare) relate within a whole system, prompting new questions about interconnections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.
4.  **Building Budgets of Flexibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>: Deliberately create spaces for possibility and flexibility, legitimizing the idea that complexity is a feature, not a bug, which can unleash greater possibilities and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.
5.  **Associating with Sense-Making and Learning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>: [[Innovation portfolio management | Portfolio approaches]] thrive when linked to systematic sense-making, extracting learning from diverse initiatives, and focusing on the relationships between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. This requires disciplined reflection to turn experiences into actionable intelligence and decision support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

## Funding Innovation Portfolios

Funding is a crucial aspect of [[innovation portfolio management | innovation portfolios]], signaling what's important and where resources flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. While the public sector's "bottom line" is public value, the financial aspect cannot be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

Challenges include:
*   **Traditional Funding Structures**: Public and private money often seek deliverables and individual bankable projects, leading to incremental work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. The structural challenge is that portfolios work best when funding can be pulled across different systems and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:10">[00:50:10]</a>.
*   **Lack of Suitable Instruments**: Existing instruments like project finance grants are often rigid and do not support the longer-term, adaptive approach required for portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
*   **Accountability Pressure**: In situations of rising debt or reduced resources, there's a natural tendency to demand more accountability and restriction, making it harder to introduce flexible financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.

Solutions and emerging practices:
*   **Prototype New Systems**: Some organizations are prototyping new systems with new financial instruments, like the "Mayors for Growth" initiative with UNDP, which framed funding around accepting complexity and continuous discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.
*   **System Financing Blueprints**: Developing blueprints for "system financing" that support portfolios rather than individual projects is being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
*   **Transformational Capital**: Structuring investment vehicles to enable investment directly into the capacity of the portfolio itself to induce effects, rather than specific projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. This can attract combinations of recovery funds, structural funds, and philanthropic capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.
*   **Impact Logic and Qualitative Outcomes**: A robust heuristic that demonstrates how funding connects to inquiries, direct innovation to policy learning, and addresses various concerns (e.g., emissions, adaptation, social cohesion) can unlock finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. Emphasis on qualitative outcomes and learning questions is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.
*   **Narratives and Anecdotes**: Focusing on narratives, stories, and experiences from the perspective of those impacted helps in evaluation and understanding, providing a "warm understanding" of problems and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

## The Role of the Portfolio Steward

The role of a portfolio manager or "steward" is different from a traditional project manager, especially since the job description for a [[public sector innovation | public sector innovation]] portfolio manager is still emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.

Instead of a strict manager who dictates plans, a portfolio manager acts as a "gardener" or "orchestrator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>. They are like an editor, able to combine, connect, and understand what makes sense, responsible for the "editorial line" that ensures coherence and quality of impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.

This role requires:
*   **Differentiating Objectives from Intent**: Creating space to discuss a common intent rather than immediately jumping to specific, often narrow, objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This shifts the organization's identity from a solution provider to a facilitator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.
*   **Creating Shared Mental Models**: Investing time in building shared mental models among management and within the organization, which allows for adaptation and adjustment as circumstances change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.
*   **Bridging Cultures**: Recognizing that [[public sector innovation | innovation units]] often aim to change others without challenging their own ways of working. Creating "labs" that act as bridges between public administrations and citizens or other cultural approaches can foster productive conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The focus should be on practical steps and moving forward together, rather than just formal exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

## Ecosystem Approach and the Public Body's Role

For society-wide challenges, unilateral action by a single lab or administration is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>. Governments, as entities often held responsible, need to steer an ecosystem of actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

Key aspects of this ecosystem approach:
*   **Coherence Between Problem and Solution**: If problems require fundamental societal change, then solutions must involve broad engagement coherent with that scale and reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>.
*   **Governments Represent Ecosystems**: Governments are representations of how society structures itself. The focus should be on enabling public bodies with the capability and mindset shifts to embrace roles as challenge owners, orchestrators, and conveners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.
*   **Radical Collaboration**: Designing for and rewarding radical collaboration is an explicit requirement for working together, both within public bodies and across different layers of decision-making (local, regional, national) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>.
*   **Technology for Relationships**: Utilizing technology, particularly AI, to help look across relationships and foster radical collaboration across ecosystems, rather than reinforcing silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.

This approach transforms [[public sector innovation | innovation portfolio management]] from mere decision support to a means of learning support, opening up new actions and resisting the urge to rush to the first solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. It emphasizes narrative, intent, and navigating organizational logic to foster a new way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>.

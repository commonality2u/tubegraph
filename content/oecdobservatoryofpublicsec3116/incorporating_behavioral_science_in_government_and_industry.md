The **OECD report "Mind Shift Green Lift: Six Behavioral Science trends for Environmental Policy"** highlights the critical role of human behavior in tackling climate challenges and achieving a green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The report emphasizes that progress in addressing climate change is not solely dependent on technical solutions, but requires a deep understanding of how people live, work, and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. By focusing on human behavior, the report aims to help governments bridge the gap between ambitious goals and real-world impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## OECD's Role and Commitment
The OECD recognizes that human behavior is central to the green transition, and that achieving a low-carbon future necessitates changing behaviors across individuals, businesses, and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. [[Behavioral science in government]] offers valuable insights to encourage these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The OECD has a long history of using [[role_of_behavioral_science_in_government_policy | behavioral economics and behavioral insights for policymaking]] worldwide, starting as early as 2007 or 2008 with a major report on consumer policy, which included environmental aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>. The organization has also been instrumental in building a network of specialists interested in using behavioral insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.

The OECD is leading a multi-disciplinary "Net Zero Plus" project to address complex climate challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This project aims to create a comprehensive narrative on climate change, focusing on a rapid, just, and resilient transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing resilience to climate impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Key Policy Areas Supported by Behavioral Science
The "Net Zero Plus" project includes:
*   **Demand-side policies for climate change mitigation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>: This paper draws on work from the IEA and OECD, offering insights into sectors like energy use in buildings, transport, waste, and diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. [[Behavioral science in public administration | Behavioral science]] tools like green defaults, social influences, and choice architecture have proven effective in fostering sustainable behavior across these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Government-citizen interface in driving climate action** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>: This paper explores how governments can more effectively engage citizens, building on OECD's work on trusting government, citizen participation, public communication, and [[behavioral insights in government | behavioral science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Positive tipping points** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>: This work stream investigates how social, economic, and political tipping points can lead to systemic shifts and accelerate emission reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Behavioral mechanisms, such as choice architecture for consumer and producer behavior, and social norms/peer effects to cement habits, can play a pivotal role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy
The policy paper identifies six key trends illustrating how governments are harnessing [[behavioral insights in government | behavioral science]] to accelerate the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. These trends are based on an analysis of numerous case studies from over 30 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

### 1. Informing Policies at Every Stage of the Policy Cycle
Traditionally, [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] was often used late in the policy process, primarily for fine-tuning existing policies or improving communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. However, analysis shows that policymakers are now integrating [[behavioral insights in government | behavioral science]] at every stage of the policy cycle, including at the very start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. This approach helps them better understand behavioral challenges and design more effective policies from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. This integration is becoming part of good governance in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

> [!Example] France's Repairability Index
> The Behavioral Science team at France's Interministerial Directorate for Public Transformation developed a repairability index for electronic products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. By applying [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] at every policy stage, they identified that 62% of consumers discarded broken electronic devices without considering repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. They designed and tested labels to empower consumers with informed choices on repairability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. Implementation led to consumers increasingly opting for higher repairability scores and manufacturers introducing more repairable laptops, demonstrating effectiveness on both demand and supply sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

### 2. Driving Climate Adaptation Efforts
While [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] has historically focused on climate mitigation, it is increasingly supporting climate adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. Adaptation involves adjusting behaviors to cope with immediate and long-term effects of climate change, such as preventing wildfires or guiding actions during floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Effective adaptation policies require grounding in real-world human behavior, leading policymakers to turn to [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] for smarter strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

> [!Example] Australia's Drought Assistance for Farmers
> During Australia's severe drought (2017-2019), the uptake of available support for farmers was low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. The Australian government's behavioral economics team (BETA) identified barriers: farmers knew about assistance but not how to concretely ask for it, the application process was overly complicated, and there was a stigma attached to seeking help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. Farmers often waited until situations became critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. BETA recommended reframing support to encourage early assistance and establishing trusted local points of contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

### 3. Predicting and Accounting for Public Acceptability of Green Reforms
Governments are increasingly using [[behavioral insights in government | behavioral science]] to predict and account for public acceptability of green reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. Understanding how people perceive and respond to policies is crucial for building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. By leveraging data, especially longitudinal data, governments can gauge citizens' climate awareness, support for reforms, preferences, and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. This allows for designing clearer, more accessible policies aligned with public values, fostering trust and strengthening the impact of green reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

> [!Example] Netherlands' SME Sustainability Investments
> The Behavioral Science team at the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy conducted research (surveys, focus groups, interviews, online experiments) to understand behavioral drivers and barriers for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) investing in sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. While 64% of SMEs were inclined to make their businesses more sustainable, only 5-18% had taken feasible steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. Main motivators included high energy prices, cost savings, and legal compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. Barriers included high perceived costs (time and money) and preference for other priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. These insights were instrumental in shaping policy approaches tailored to the behavioral realities of SMEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

### 4. Boosting Citizen Participation in Environmental Policies
Governments are increasingly turning to [[behavioral insights in government | behavioral science]] to boost citizen participation in environmental policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. Proactive and inclusive methods are being used to engage citizens in shaping and implementing green policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. Given that many citizens feel a lack of meaningful participation in policymaking (the "trust gap"), [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] helps bridge this gap by aligning policies with public expectations, fostering trust, and making engagement easier by removing barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

> [!Example] Ireland's National Dialogue on Climate Action
> Ireland's National Dialogue on Climate Action, led by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, aims to engage citizens in climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. Its goals are to raise awareness, motivate action, empower sustainable behaviors, and use findings to inform policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. Since 2021, over 12,000 citizens have participated in annual climate conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. The program has produced a behavioral insights dashboard, allowing policymakers to integrate evidence from social and behavioral studies into policy design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

### 5. Increasing Demand for Sustainable Goods, Services, and Technologies
Governments are increasingly using [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] to drive demand for sustainable goods, services, and technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. Demand-side policies are considered essential, with the potential to reduce emissions by up to 70% by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>. This includes:
*   Designing and testing labels to encourage sustainable consumer choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   Removing barriers to increase the use of green services like public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   Encouraging the adoption of green technologies (e.g., heat pumps) by making them financially appealing and easier to adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.

> [!Example] Denmark's Climate Labels for Food Choices
> The Danish Competition and Consumer Authority tested two types of climate labels (best-in-class and scale label) to guide consumers toward more sustainable food choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. Consumers preferred the scale label, but it did not lead to a significant change in overall purchasing behavior in the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. While the scale label improved the ability to identify climate-friendly alternatives, the aggregate effect on CO2 emissions was neutral, as some consumers increased emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. The team suggested labels need to provide clearer, more specific information that resonates with consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>, emphasizing that widespread behavior change requires consumer engagement and education, not just better labeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

### 6. Building Resilience to Climate Misinformation
Governments are leveraging [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] to build resilience against climate misinformation and tackle its spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>. This involves understanding people's susceptibility to misinformation, factors driving its spread, and developing strategies to counter its impact and strengthen democratic resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

> [!Example] Canada's Parka Initiative
> Canada's Program of Applied Research on Climate Action (PARKA) conducts national surveys and in-depth studies to assess the Canadian public's susceptibility to climate-related misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. The aim is to understand how people think, feel, and act when confronted with misinformation, and to identify the most harmful types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. In 2024, a randomized control trial tested behaviorally informed interventions to boost resilience to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. Interventions focusing on enhancing digital media literacy and providing active preemptive refutations of false claims were most effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. However, passively informing people how to find misinformation without critical thinking tools made them more skeptical and less accurate in identifying true headlines, highlighting unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.

## Moving from Insights to Action: Recommendations for Governments
To move from insights to action and accelerate the green transition, the report presents four key recommendations for governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>:

1.  **Harness [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] to trigger positive social tipping points** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. Governments should identify critical moments and behaviors that can spark systemic change, amplifying traditional policies and ensuring enduring, widespread behavior shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.
2.  **Drive demand for sustainable choices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. As more people adopt sustainable behaviors (e.g., energy-efficient products, public transport), a ripple effect can drive broader change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. [[Behavioral science in public administration | Behavioral science]] tools like default options and dynamic social norms can help achieve widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
3.  **Engage citizens as active participants** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>. Governments should empower people as agents of change by reducing participation barriers, building trust, and aligning policies with public expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
4.  **Strengthen decision-making within governments themselves** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. Integrating [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] into governmental decision-making processes for environmental policies can reduce biases and improve overall effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>.

### Important Considerations
The report also highlights three crucial caveats for the application of [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] in environmental policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>:

1.  **Do not place the entire burden of responsibility on individuals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. The goal is to empower consumers, users, and citizens as active participants in the green transition, ensuring they are part of the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.
2.  **[[Behavioral science in public administration | Behavioral science]] is not a "silver bullet"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. While behavioral change is important, it is one piece of a broader strategy that must include technology and systemic changes for meaningful progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.
3.  **"Demand-side policies" extend beyond individual choices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. This approach considers governments and industries as actors, recognizing the power of government procurement efforts to systematically move the demand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. Achieving real impact demands collaboration across all sectors, not just private households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

## Application to Industry
[[Behavioral science in public administration | Behavioral science]] can also be applied effectively within industries and businesses, not just for individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30">[01:21:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Greening employee behavior internally** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>.
*   **Work within industry associations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a>.
*   **Using insights for negotiations, social norms, and group dynamics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:35">[01:22:35]</a>.
*   **Applying "regulatory nudging"** or other behavioral insights to influence industry practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>.
*   **Regulating the supply side** through tools like "budges" (behavioral insights used to restrict and regulate supply) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.
*   **Testing combinations of fiscal and behavioral policies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>, including policy sequencing where softer policies are introduced first to build understanding for harder ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>.

While commercial entities also use behavioral insights, the key difference lies in legitimacy and accountability; governments are responsible to citizens, unlike commercial entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>.

## Future Directions: AI and Personalization
The increasing role of AI in governance and the behavioral community is a significant area of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. AI offers opportunities to:
*   **Personalize interventions** to meet diverse target groups of consumers and people, moving beyond a "one-size-fits-all" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>.
*   **Utilize advances in computational social science and large datasets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>.
*   **Train data sets and identify clusters of people** using machine learning to iteratively target and segment populations for more effective tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>.

This intersection of behavioral and environmental policymaking presents a great asset to explore for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities
Despite the potential, there are significant challenges:
*   **Political backlash against green transition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>.
*   **Epistemological crisis** where social groups interpret facts differently, hindering true deliberative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:01">[01:49:01]</a>.
*   **Misinformation and disinformation** spread, identified as a top global worry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:36">[01:49:36]</a>.
*   **Crisis of trust in government**, with low citizen confidence in public institutions and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:27">[01:50:27]</a>.
*   **Potential for increasing focus on climate adaptation over mitigation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>, which could be easier to support due to local, quicker, and more visible effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:52">[01:24:52]</a>. There is a concern that resources for mitigation and adaptation come from the same pool, leading to less focus on mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>. Behavioral scientists should look at backfiring effects of adaptation on mitigation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. A clear hierarchy should always be communicated: avoidance (mitigation) first, then adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:55">[01:27:55]</a>.

However, behavioral approaches offer valuable tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:02">[01:52:02]</a>:
*   They are more adaptable, local, and participative ("little speedboats" rather than "huge tankers") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:18">[01:52:18]</a>.
*   They can help build horizontal trust and motivate sustainability at a smaller, more local scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:35">[01:52:35]</a>.
*   They can improve acceptability and effectiveness through participation and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:43">[01:52:43]</a>.
*   They encourage "deep listening" and empathy to understand diverse opinions, which is best done on a smaller scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:54">[01:52:54]</a>.
*   [[Challenges and Best Practices in Institutionalizing Behavioral Science | Behavioral science]] can help detect "dark nudges" and "dark patterns" and inform "counter-nudging" strategies against forces unhelpful for global welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:18">[01:54:18]</a>.

The report serves as a practical roadmap for embedding [[behavioral science in public administration | behavioral science]] into environmental, energy, and climate policy, by centering human behavior, using evidence-based resources, and focusing on rigorous evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>.

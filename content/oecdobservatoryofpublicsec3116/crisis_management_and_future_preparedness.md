The "Government After Shock" event was convened to make sense of a highly complicated global context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Supported by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, the event aimed to address three core questions regarding the ongoing crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>:
*   What needs to be left behind? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
*   What should be kept? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   What should be done differently? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

These questions seek to provide insight into the meaning of the crisis and what it has revealed about the role and expectations of government moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## The State's Evolving Role

The crisis has unequivocally underscored the vital role of the state, marking what some perceive as a "return of the state," reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This period has highlighted the critical need for strong public sector capabilities and capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Governments have demonstrated an ability to work in more flexible ways with the private sector and the broader community, often due to a lack of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. A key question emerging from this experience is whether societies can learn from it to build a more flexible, anticipatory, and [[lessons_learned_from_the_covid19_crisis_and_the_future_of_public_sector_resilience | resilient state]] to face future challenges, such as the climate crisis or other "known unknowns" like pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Lessons from Latvia's Experience

Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš of Latvia shared crucial insights from his country's experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>:
*   **Speed of Reaction** In the first wave, Latvia implemented restrictions very quickly, even before the first COVID-19 death, which helped to flatten the curve effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Societal Cooperation** Gaining society's cooperation is paramount. During the first wave, clear communication about the danger and proposed solutions led to extensive public cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Challenges of Success** Paradoxically, the success of the first wave created difficulties for the second. Economic impacts, such as job and wage losses, increased societal stress, leading to a slower collective reaction time (3.5 weeks compared to 10 days initially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Balancing Freedom and Health** In democratic societies, a significant challenge lies in convincing citizens to accept restrictions that curtail personal freedoms for public health, especially when dissenting views exist within government and among experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Key Takeaways** [[effective_communication_and_citizen_trust_in_crisis | Effective communication]] and a government's inability to move faster than its society's willingness to follow are critical for successful crisis response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

Looking ahead, Latvia anticipates a "long haul" with the virus, even with promising vaccine developments, due to logistical challenges in distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Preparedness for a potential third wave requires continuous public information campaigns on self-protection and implementing safety measures during periods of low epidemic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## Insights from Serbia's Approach

Prime Minister Ana Brnabić of Serbia shared her nation's experiences in navigating the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. She acknowledged the ongoing search for the best response, noting that policies are constantly changing and adapting to the dynamic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. Serbia's strategy focused on balancing public health protection with economic needs, recognizing that a functioning economy is essential to fund the extraordinary costs of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

Serbia's prior investments in digitization and e-government, initiated in 2017, proved invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. These reforms, aimed at improving government efficiency and transparency, allowed Serbia to continue providing services electronically to citizens and businesses without interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. Notably, Serbia did not lose a single day of schooling in 2020, thanks to investments in digital education that enabled a swift transition to online learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

The prime minister highlighted how digitization contributes to:
*   **Efficiency**: Providing 24/7 services and automating repetitive tasks using artificial intelligence (AI), leading to significant productivity and efficiency gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Anti-Corruption**: Reducing physical contact between civil servants and citizens minimizes opportunities for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. For example, fully electronic construction permitting transformed Serbia from a difficult process to one of the top 10 globally for speed and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.
*   **Environmental Benefits**: Digitization significantly reduces paper consumption, saving trees, water, and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   **Economic [[resilience_building | Resilience]]**: Investments in an innovation-driven economy, particularly the ICT sector (6% of GDP), helped mitigate the economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Serbia's GDP decline was limited to an enviable -1% (or -0.7%) for 2020, and unemployment did not increase, partly due to programs like "My First Salary" which addressed youth unemployment by subsidizing initial work experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.

A key concern for the future is the potential for the pandemic to widen the gap between rich and poor countries, as labor-intensive economies suffer more than innovation-based, knowledge-driven ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

## Strengths and Weaknesses of Governments

The crisis has exposed both strengths and weaknesses in governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>. Many governments, initially unprepared, reacted swiftly during the pandemic, rapidly increasing healthcare capacities like beds, intensive care units, and medical staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.

A crucial strength lies in building [[effective_communication_and_citizen_trust_in_crisis | trust]] between people and their administration, which is pivotal for addressing societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. High trust correlates with better compliance and results; studies show lower non-essential mobility in high-trust regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. People's perception of government competence, integrity, openness, and fairness significantly influences trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Conversely, a lack of trust undermines policy efficacy and can amplify fear, leading to harmful behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Governments must fight misinformation by being more open and engaging directly with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

The crisis has also underscored underlying issues such as inequalities, economic insecurity, and uneven healthcare access, while exacerbating a "crisis of trust" and inserting fear into the social fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Vulnerabilities in global value chains (e.g., for essential goods like masks) highlight the need for better public procurement, risk mitigation, and [[international_collaboration_in_crisis_management | international regulatory cooperation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

## Preparing for the Next Crisis

To prepare for future crises, a "new normal" must be established, as the previous normal was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>. This involves making decisions today with a forward-looking scenario in mind, ensuring that investments are:
*   **Green and Sustainable**: Addressing climate change remains an urgent intergenerational responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Inclusive**: Prioritizing people and addressing inequalities, particularly digital skills for low-skilled workers to integrate into a more digital economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>.
*   **[[resilience_building | Resilient]]**: Building greater resistance to future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.

The pandemic, as the most global phenomenon faced, clearly demonstrates the imperative for [[international_collaboration_in_crisis_management | international cooperation]] and a multilateral approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. Vaccines, for instance, should be treated as a public good, made available affirmatively based on global needs, rather than through competitive advance payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>.

Another critical aspect of future preparedness is adapting to the enormous changes in the perception of individual freedoms and civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. Governments must carefully navigate the balance between protecting public health (e.g., mandatory masks, social distancing, contact tracing) and safeguarding civil liberties, especially in societies susceptible to conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. A key commitment for the future is to initiate public debates with humanities and social sciences experts to guide governments on how to protect both health and civil liberties in crisis situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>.

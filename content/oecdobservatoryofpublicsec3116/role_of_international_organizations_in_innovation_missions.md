International organizations play a significant role in fostering and implementing [[mission_oriented_innovation | innovation missions]], particularly in addressing complex societal challenges. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are two examples of organizations actively engaged in this field, contributing to [[mission_oriented_innovation_in_public_policy | public policy]] and practical implementation across various contexts, including low and middle-income countries.

## OECD's Contribution to Innovation Missions

The OECD is a central player in the discourse and practical application of [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]].

### Defining and Understanding Missions
The OECD has collaborated with countries and policymakers to establish a consensual definition of [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation policy]]. For the OECD, it is defined as a coordinated package of policy and regulatory measures tailored to mobilize science, technology, and innovation (STI) to address societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This package spans several stages of the innovation cycle, uses different policy instruments (supply-side, demand-side, regulatory), crosses policy fields, sectors, and disciplines, and is targeted towards ambitious, bold, measurable goals with defined time frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

The OECD's understanding of this policy approach has progressed through observing experiments, pilots, and fully-fledged [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented policy]] and [[mission_oriented_innovation | innovation initiatives]] in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Addressing Implementation Challenges
A core focus for the OECD is exploring the challenges in [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]], particularly in operationalizing ambitions and experimenting with making missions work in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. They seek insights on practical implementation, especially concerning the long-term [[governance_and_implementation_of_innovation_missions | governance of missions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Challenges often arise in three main dimensions:
*   **Strategic Orientation:** Creating broad consensus on societal challenges and translating them into clear, bold, measurable objectives, securing stakeholder involvement without diluting the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Policy Coordination:** Coordinating public and private actors across disciplinary, sectoral, and policy silos to work towards commonly agreed missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This includes engaging policy bodies beyond the STI area, such as sectoral ministries and regulatory bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Policy Implementation:** Implementing packages of complementary policy and regulatory instruments, connecting supply-side and demand-side instruments, managing solution portfolios, and monitoring and evaluating these systemic policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### The Missions Action Lab
To support practical implementation, the OECD has launched the Missions Action Lab. This cross-directorate initiative, involving the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, the Directorate for Science Technology and Innovation, and the Development Corporation Directorate, aims to help policymakers and stakeholders face challenges and find practical solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

The lab seeks to "put its skin in the game" by actively participating in mission creation and cross-disciplinary collaboration across countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. It has already conducted simulations, boot camps, and capacity-building exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Key activities include:
*   **Demonstration Cases:** Selecting three to four demonstration cases across different mission areas, types, and countries to work directly on delivery and test new coordination and [[governance_and_implementation_of_innovation_missions | governance]] methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Sharing:** Building a community and sharing knowledge on how missions are set and run, including experiences from OECD countries and low/middle-income countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
*   **Research Agenda:** The lab's research agenda will address unaddressed questions related to [[governance_and_implementation_of_innovation_missions | governance]], policy setting, and implementation, including issues like projectification, procurement, working across government bodies, and engaging diverse partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

The OECD also acknowledges its internal reorientation to break its own silos in addressing missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

## UNDP's Engagement in Innovation Missions (Vietnam Context)
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), particularly through its Accelerator Lab network (over 90 countries) and Deep Demonstrations initiative, approaches [[mission_oriented_innovation | innovation missions]] as a necessary response to complex, fast-moving social and environmental challenges that traditional development organizations were not designed for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

### Deep Demonstrations and Systems Approaches
UNDP Vietnam, as part of the Deep Demonstrations initiative, explores how to facilitate new approaches within an organization designed with different incentive structures and operating ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>. This initiative is grounded in the notion that single-point solutions or short-term approaches are insufficient for addressing complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

### Addressing Vietnam's Circular Economy Transition
In Vietnam, UNDP is grappling with the challenge of transitioning from a linear to a circular economy, given rapid growth that has come with high environmental costs, such as being the fourth-largest plastic waste producer globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. This requires leveraging existing resources and understanding how to finance a systems transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

Key aspects of UNDP's approach in Vietnam include:
*   **Portfolio Sense-Making:** An iterative process to rapidly learn and extract insights from current projects, leveraging existing resources within UNDP's project portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>. This helps identify acceleration opportunities and ensures interventions are coherent and learn from each other to achieve systemic [[impact_and_strategic_orientation_of_innovation_missions | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.
*   **Reframing Challenges:** Using a "studio approach" (team-based and design-led) to unpack the problem space and understand underlying drivers from diverse perspectives (e.g., architects, journalists, economists, biologists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.
    *   This led to insights that the circular economy transition, while often seen as an environmental issue, requires broader cross-ministerial interventions to change fundamental economic and market logics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.
    *   It also revealed that the transition should be treated as an emergency, similar to the agile, silo-breaking response to COVID-19 in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:30">[01:25:30]</a>.
    *   The transition is vital for "future-proofing Vietnam" by managing risks and building resilience towards future shocks, with inherent economic incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:23">[01:26:23]</a>.
*   **Local Engagement:** Recognizing the need for a "movement" and critical mass at the local level for successful implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a>. UNDP supported a circular economy hub to incubate business ideas, which led the local government in Da Nang to develop a circular economy roadmap engaging various local government parts and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Portfolios:** Acknowledging that unexpected things happen during implementation, portfolios must be able to adapt and pivot based on continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. The challenge lies in established development project mechanisms that don't easily allow for such flexibility, affecting both UNDP and its donors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.

## Broader Context and Challenges
Both the OECD and UNDP highlight the importance of international collaboration and learning from diverse experiences in [[mission_oriented_innovation | innovation missions]]. The experiences from countries like Norway (Research Council of Norway) and Australia (CSIRO) further underscore the complexities of scaling up initiatives, coordinating across different agencies and levels of government, and navigating cultural and formal differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. Integrating national missions with broader regional (e.g., European Union) or global missions is also considered important to maximize impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the urgent need for [[role_of_systems_thinking_in_crisis_management | systemic approaches]] in [[government_response_to_COVID19 | government response]] and [[public_sector_innovation_during_COVID19 | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Experts suggest that the pandemic exploited existing flaws in governance systems, making it a symptom of deeper underlying issues rather than an isolated event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>.

### The Need for Systemic Change
The crisis has prompted calls for radical reforms to prevailing policy directions, with a consensus emerging that [[government_response_to_COVID19 | government]] policies need to systematically change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The massive amount of [[public_sector_innovation_in_response_to_covid19 | innovative responses]] seen from governments, initially tactical, are increasingly moving towards strategic aims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. The challenge now is to sustain this momentum and work towards [[role_of_systems_thinking_in_crisis_management | systemic change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### Key Observations and Challenges

#### Revealed Vulnerabilities and Inequalities
The pandemic has brought to light new needs and vulnerabilities that either previously existed but became visible or were created by the crisis itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The vulnerabilities experienced today are a testament to the inadequacy of past worldviews that shaped current systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. The crisis has brutally accelerated global long-term trends and revealed an ongoing paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
Inequality is a significant systemic issue, with the gap between the affluent and disadvantaged growing significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. For example, in Helsinki, COVID prevalence aligns with areas of high unemployment and immigrant populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. In the US, racial disparities in COVID-19 deaths highlight the inextricable link between the pandemic and issues like Black Lives Matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

#### Flawed Governance Systems
The crisis exposed flaws in public governance systems that were not aligned with their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. Governments face a crucial decision: whether to use public resources to save old structures or to help those affected by the failure of the old system prepare for new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. Restoring the system to its previous state might be a self-defeating strategy as it could bring the system back to a state no longer adapted to current circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

#### Austerity and Budgetary Pressures
Austerity measures are on the horizon, with significant budget shortfalls projected for cities and countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. These gaps result from dwindling tax revenues, higher unemployment, and rising healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>. There is a strong pressure to rely on "fast, cheap, quick, carbon-intensive jobs" to revive economies, which conflicts with sustainability goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.

#### Ineffective Regulation and Preparedness
Observations show that government inspections and regulations were more or less halted across Europe during the crisis, yet society did not collapse, suggesting that much regulation may not be effective or necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>. For instance, many building codes and safety measures (like emergency exit signs) are known to be ineffective but remain in regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>.

Preparedness strategies often proved inadequate. Finland, despite having a pandemic preparedness strategy from 2008, found its strategic reserves (masks, ventilators) expired when opened during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. Failures in inter-agency coordination, where government decrees did not translate into action on the ground, also highlighted systemic weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

### Approaches to Systemic Change

#### Shifting Worldviews and Narratives
The crisis has presented two main narratives: returning to normal or using the opportunity for a serious, sustainable transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The European Commission has taken a clear stance to align recovery efforts with its EU Green Deal, pushing for green, digital, and resilient futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. This period of profound change requires institutions to evolve and remain relevant by aligning with emerging worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

#### Government as a System: Tools and Frameworks
The UK Policy Lab developed a "government as a system" toolkit to think about the roles of individuals, communities, and government in addressing complex issues like net zero and COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. This toolkit helps demystify the role of government by outlining 56 different actions, from formal powers like legislating and funding to softer powers like collaborating and enabling others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. It also helps to map local, regional, national, and [[interconnectedness_and_global_cooperation_during_the_covid19_pandemic | international]] government action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

The EU Policy Lab developed a "Complex System Analyzer" tool, a two-day workshop designed to help identify leverage points in complex systems and connect them to a future vision aligned with a more enduring worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

#### Empowering Society and Rethinking Governance
A potential [[adapting_to_crisis_with_innovative_approaches | way out]] of the crisis is for governments to step back and allow society to play a greater role, as seen in the "co-production" of solutions during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. This could involve shifting responsibility for controlling, inspecting, and even writing regulations from governments to actors within society, using mechanisms like legal liability and mandatory insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. Examples from France (building system with insurance-based checks) and the Netherlands (liability for dangerous goods transport) demonstrate this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

However, barriers to this systemic change include a "greedy government" mentality that finds it difficult to cede responsibilities due to a deep distrust of society without regulation, and institutional resistance from regulatory bodies facing budget cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.

#### Learning and Adaptation
Countries that have experienced past pandemics or regular systemic shocks (like typhoons) appear to have a stronger "muscle" for exercising underlying [[government_response_strategies_to_Covid19 | systems of governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. The ultimate measure of success for [[government_response_to_COVID19 | governments]] in a potential second wave will be how much they have learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.

Key areas for learning and adaptation include:
*   **Establishing Learning Teams:** Embedding learning teams within the core of government and on the frontlines to capture insights and mobilize external capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>.
*   **Rapid Insight Gathering:** Policy labs can rapidly bring together the best insights, working with external experts and integrating "lived experience" research with large datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Legacy Lock-ins:** Confronting existing systems, such as a carbon-intensive economy, that are inextricably linked to inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.
*   **Developing Exit Strategies:** Creating strategies that transition the system by intervening in current logic, rather than just returning to previous states. These strategies should be built on creative and socially engaged processes, ensuring diverse representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
*   **Investing in Austerity:** Using budget cuts not merely to save, but to invest in future capabilities, adopting a "cut to invest" rather than "cut to save" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.
*   **New Leadership Models:** Moving away from leadership built around risks and probabilities, recognizing that new capabilities and assets are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.

### Conclusion: Seizing the Opportunity for Reform
The [[challenges_and_responses_during_the_COVID19_pandemic | COVID-19 crisis]] presents a crucial opportunity for governments to not merely "bounce back" to old ways but to reform and rethink how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:44">[01:29:44]</a>. This involves building new "muscles" in government to prepare for potential future waves and deal with the cascading economic effects and revealed inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>. By embracing [[learning_from_global_responses_to_the_pandemic | continuous learning]], involving a broader set of citizens and stakeholders, and focusing on core values, this crisis can be seized as an opportunity for better [[public_sector_innovation_in_response_to_COVID19 | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">[01:29:07]</a>.

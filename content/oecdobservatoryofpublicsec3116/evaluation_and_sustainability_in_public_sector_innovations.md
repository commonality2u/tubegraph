[[Public Sector Innovation|Innovation]] within the public sector, particularly [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]], faces unique challenges and opportunities related to its evaluation and long-term sustainability. The aim is to foster a more digital, agile, and inclusive public administration that remains resilient and responsive to evolving societal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## The Need for [[adaptive_innovation|Adaptive Innovation]]

The current global context, highlighted by events like the COVID-19 pandemic, stresses traditional innovation strategies and underscores the crucial need for the ability to anticipate, plan, and systematically improve towards concrete outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. [[adaptive_innovation|Adaptive innovation]] involves testing new approaches to respond to changing environments, new knowledge, technological advancements, or crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. It is a key component of a comprehensive [[Public Sector Innovation|public sector innovation]] portfolio, especially given unprecedented rates of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>.

Historically, the public sector has demonstrated incredible abilities to shift focus and priorities to respond to crises, serving as a global case study of [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. However, the expectation is that this wave of [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]] continues beyond immediate crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>.

## Challenges to Sustainability and Institutionalization

Ensuring that [[Public Sector Innovation|innovation]] leads to sustainable and institutionalized changes is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. This difficulty arises from several factors:
*   **Political Cycles and Leadership Turnover** Every five years, the top leadership in some large public administrations (like the European Commission) can be almost fully exchanged, leading to a loss of institutional memory among leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:22">[02:20:22]</a>.
*   **Organizational Culture and Silos** A lot of stamina is required to continually break down existing silos and convince political leadership that a more adaptive approach is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">[02:21:17]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Scaling** Successes in [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]] can be highly contingent on specific contextual factors, making it difficult to scale efforts or assume a "one-size-fits-all" solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:01">[03:11:01]</a>.
*   **Risk of Fragmentation** An over-investment in [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]] could lead to fragmentation or a lack of coherence if projects bloom independently without aligning towards broader goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:43">[03:05:43]</a>.
*   **Integrating Successes** Incorporating successful [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]]s back into the broader organization and policy practice can be difficult, particularly if innovation labs operate too independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:28">[03:10:28]</a>.
*   **Perception of Wasteful Spending** The "slack resources" (spare time or capacity) required for [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]] can be viewed as wasteful, making them easy targets for budget cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:10">[03:12:10]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Status Quo Challenge** [[adaptive_innovation|Adaptive innovation]] efforts might challenge the status quo, potentially leading to internal organizational tension if they suggest entirely rethinking service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:53">[03:11:53]</a>.
*   **Lack of Direction** Responsive actions might lack overall direction, with something working not necessarily meaning it "should be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:41">[03:14:41]</a>.
*   **Inefficiencies from Redundancy** Multiple entities creating similar solutions independently can lead to inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:58">[03:15:58]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Gaining Buy-in** It is difficult to make a case for leaders to support [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]] if the message is that outcomes are uncertain from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>.

## Strategies for Sustainability and Evaluation

### Embracing an Agile and Iterative Approach
*   **Continuous Improvement:** [[adaptive_innovation|Adaptive innovation]] recognizes the complex ecosystem of change and emphasizes learning and iteration as core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>.
*   **Fail Fast, Fail Forward, Fail Small:** Programs like 10x in the U.S. government embrace unknown outcomes and aim to spend the smallest amount of funding necessary at each project stage to determine its worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>. Projects can be closed or graduate at any phase, allowing for diversification of investments and earlier, smaller wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Modular Funding:** Moving away from large lump sums for technology projects, incremental funding with established milestones and checkpoints allows for better diligence and risk mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>.

### Incorporating Citizen and Employee Participation
*   **Bottom-Up Approach:** [[adaptive_innovation|Adaptive innovation]] activities are often bottom-up driven, making it crucial to empower diverse stakeholders to explore different angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>.
*   **User-Centric Design:** Engaging with citizens and frontline civil servants is essential to understand real needs and expectations, and to co-create solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>. Examples include LabX's work on citizen shops and youth services in Portugal, where feedback from direct users informs service redesign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **Employee-Sourced Ideas:** Government employees, as hands-on practitioners, are a valuable source of ideas for solving daily problems, making programs that solicit their input highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

### Rethinking Evaluation and Measuring Impact
*   **Beyond Efficiency:** Traditional evaluation focuses on economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. For [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]], an additional "E" for **efficacy** (the ability to take action when things change direction) is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:42">[02:23:42]</a>.
*   **Valuing Externalities:** It is vital to articulate the "cost of doing nothing" or "cost of non-innovation" by factoring in externalities beyond direct financial transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:16">[02:18:16]</a>. This includes social costs (e.g., frustration with inefficient services, health impacts of isolation) and economic benefits (e.g., increased citizen engagement, volunteering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:10">[02:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:44">[02:16:44]</a>.
*   **Matching Evaluation to Innovation Type:** Evaluation methods must match the type of innovation being dealt with. Methods like outcome harvesting, contribution analysis, and process analysis, which develop alongside the project, are suitable for [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]] where baselines may not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:25">[02:24:25]</a>.
*   **Producing Knowledge During the Project:** Instead of just evaluating after the fact, the goal should be to produce knowledge *during* the project's development, especially in uncertain and complex situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:07">[02:25:07]</a>.

### Building Supportive Ecosystems
*   **Governance Innovation:** Establishing a new governance framework, such as "agile governance" as proposed in Japan, involves continuous and rapid cycles of analysis, goal definition, system design, implementation, and evaluation with multi-stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. This applies to various governance mechanisms (corporate governance, regulation, infrastructure, markets, societal norms) and even a "governance of governance" to ensure a comprehensive, agile approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.
*   **Financial Incentives:** Providing financial incentives, like the European Commission's funding programs, can help de-risk the transition to a more adaptive public sector for member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:13">[02:22:13]</a>.
*   **Investment in Knowledge and Expertise:** Governments need to invest in developing knowledge and expertise in digital technologies and innovation within their own structures, rather than solely relying on external private organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:14">[02:06:14]</a>.

Ultimately, for [[Public Sector Innovation|public sector innovation]] to be sustainable, it requires not only technological advancements but also a fundamental rethinking of governance structures, continuous learning, empowerment of various players, and a shift towards human-centric, participative approaches that build trust and address complex societal goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>.

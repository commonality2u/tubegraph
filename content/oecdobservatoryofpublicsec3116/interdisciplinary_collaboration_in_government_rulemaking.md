Interdisciplinary collaboration is seen as a crucial element for successful public sector innovation, particularly in the realm of rulemaking. It involves bringing together diverse expertise to create more effective, adaptive, and user-centric policies and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.

## Importance and Rationale
The need for [[crossdisciplinary_collaboration_for_mission_success | cross-disciplinary collaboration]] stems from several factors:
*   **Addressing the "Translation Gap"**: There is often a significant gap between what is written in legislation and how it is implemented on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. This gap can lead to incorrect or inconsistent application of rules, potentially causing inequities or mispayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. Lawyers are currently used as "very expensive and quite variable modems" to translate between analog and digital formats, highlighting an ineffective approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.
*   **Adapting to Digital Paradigms**: Policy development often involves only policy specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. Without including diverse perspectives like service designers, technologists, end-users, and data experts, rules may not suit their intended purpose in a digital world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. For example, rules around heart monitors were developed without technical input, leading to a dangerous vulnerability where open Wi-Fi could allow pacemakers to be stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
*   **Designing for a Complex World**: In a modern, highly complex world, it is crucial to have multi-disciplinary teams in the room to test, iterate, and implement new policies rapidly and in a test-driven manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. This ensures high confidence in the intended impact of policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
*   **Shaping Society for Machine Users**: Rules now need to consider machines as users, not just humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. Machines do not respond to traditional legal, financial, or criminal pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. Designing for machine users requires new security, monitoring, and intervention paradigms appropriate for the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.
*   **Improving Policy Outcomes**: [[Impact of rules as code on public administration and policy making | Rules as Code]] can help identify gray areas in legislation and enable better policy modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. It can also simplify access to social benefits by bringing together various public administrations, researchers, and citizens on a single platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.
*   **Enhancing Transparency and Accountability**: By making rules understandable and actionable for machines, it also makes them more transparent for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. This allows for improved traceability, enabling citizens to understand the legal basis of decisions and facilitating auditing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. People should not have to trust government blindly but should have visibility and transparency into its operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.

## Challenges and How to Foster It
A significant challenge in implementing [[Collaboration and governance in digital services | digital transformation]], including rules as code, is establishing the legitimacy of building interdisciplinary teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>. It requires convincing people within and outside government to work together beyond traditional silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:28">[01:16:28]</a>.

### Strategies to Encourage Collaboration:
*   **Focus on Impact and Use Cases**: Instead of abstract notions, find specific areas or subsets of legislation where rules as code can address a clear need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>. This could be an area undergoing massive changes or one where a "whole of government approach" aims to improve service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. Providing a "shiny toy" or clear benefit for actors to work on can onboard them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.
*   **Start Small and Iterate**: It is crucial to prototype and iterate, rather than trying to transform the entire administrative structure at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. This agile approach is not unique to rules as code but is fundamental to effective government transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>.
*   **Break Silos**: Actively work to bring together diverse groups such as economists, developers, and policy officers to collaboratively imagine and create rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Harness External Intelligence**: Recognize and integrate the intelligence of civil society, hackers, researchers, and developers outside of government. There are many intelligent people already doing work that can complement government efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Open sourcing systems and fostering [[Collaborative Learning and Innovation in Government | collaborative learning]] can facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>.
*   **Shift Organizational Structure**: The objective is not just to change how rules are written but to change the very basic organization of government itself, making it more impact-driven and user-centric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. This involves adapting management practices and the chain of command to support more open and collaborative environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.

### Example from France
In France, the "Open Fisca" project started in 2011-2012 when treasury agents needed simulation software to understand the impact of law changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>. The deliberate decision to open-source this software in 2013, with the intention of "government as a platform," allowed it to be reused by the public sector for citizen-facing tools (e.g., understanding tax obligations or benefit entitlements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>. This open approach then attracted new contributors from within the French administration, NGOs, private companies, researchers, and civil society, creating a collaborative ecosystem driven by concrete uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:18">[01:12:18]</a>. This initiative, alongside others like "Lex Impact," helps bridge the information asymmetry in policy debate by making policy impact models available in code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>.

Ultimately, rules as code and the associated policy transformation require a shift in mindset and organizational culture, not just technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. It's about how technology integrates with cultures and practices to enable an augmented, resilient, and responsive public sector fit for the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>.

This article explores the fundamentals of [[public_sector_innovation|public sector innovation]], examining its definition, significance, diverse forms, and the common barriers encountered in government contexts. It draws insights from the Horizon 2020 innovation webinar series, featuring experts from Denmark, Belgium, and Slovenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The goal is to return to the basics of what [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] truly is, why it matters in a governmental context, and how to advance the [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## What is [[Public sector innovation|Innovation]]?
The OPSI (Observatory of Public Sector Innovation) defines [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] as something that is:
*   **Novel or New to the Context** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>
*   **Implemented**: It is about action and doing something, not just an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Has Impact or Shifts Public Value**: Innovations should improve public outcomes or serve the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Learning from both successes and failures is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

The OPSI aims to uncover emerging practices, identify what's next, normalize the idea that [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] can be a strategic resource for governments, and provide trusted advice to guide the [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] agenda forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Why [[Public sector innovation|Innovate]]?
[[Public sector innovation|Innovation]] is crucial for governments for several key reasons:
1.  **Keeping Pace with Change**: Governments often move slowly and can be reactive. [[Public sector innovation|Innovation]] enables proactivity and engagement with new technology, opportunities, and the changing context of uncertainty, volatility, and ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
2.  **Building Trust**: It helps foster trust between governments and citizens by designing and delivering services that meet citizen needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
3.  **Exploring Uncertainty**: [[Public sector innovation|Innovation]] acts as a resource to explore uncertainty, engage with possible futures, and steer towards preferred futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
4.  **Improving Public Value**: Ultimately, governments serve the people, and [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] is about improving public services and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

**The Cost of Inaction**
Prime Minister Janice Johnson stated, "If we talk about climate change, by far the biggest challenge is [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]]. If we only deal with the consequences, we will never solve the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Similarly, Guitar Rickard noted, "If nothing happens, the political risk is higher than if something happens. Something has to happen and something has to change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. The cost of doing nothing is much higher than the cost of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
</div>

During the COVID-19 recovery phase, key challenges for delivering better public services included a lack of vision and leadership to move on from old ways, and difficulty reaching groups that feel forgotten or left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. While 27% of public managers were willing and ready to learn from the crisis and adapt, a significant 52.3% were willing to acknowledge lessons learned but not as willing to change behaviors or take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

## [[Facets of Public Sector Innovation|Facets of Public Sector Innovation]]
The OPSI framework helps understand different types of [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] activities and how governments can support them systemically, moving beyond a "sticky notes approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Traditional policymaking tools were designed for predictability, but introducing portfolios creates space for complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Enhancement-Oriented Innovation
This type of [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] is characterized by "quick wins" and "doing things better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Examples include shifting to e-signatures or digital procedures from paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. It can also involve systemic improvement of a service, such as Estonia's proactive family benefit system, where the government automatically informs families of available services when a baby is born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

### Adaptive Innovation
Common during crises like COVID-19, adaptive [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] involves simple adjustments based on necessity, such as shifting to telework or adapting communication strategies for social media use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. It also involves governance approaches that continuously adapt to changing circumstances, exemplified by Japan's agile governance model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This model involves a constant cycle of understanding changing conditions and risks, setting new goals, developing new systems, implementing, and evaluating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

### Mission-Oriented Innovation
This approach addresses difficult, complex targets like climate change by working with a wide range of stakeholders to collectively define problems, develop solutions, and implement and understand their impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Examples include EU mission areas focused on climate neutrality, healthy oceans, and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. It relies on comprehensive coordination, collaborative mechanisms, collective long-term visions, institutional infrastructure, and supportive funding and regulatory environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.

<div class="callout is-info">
Perez Turneris from OPSI noted that COVID-19 presented an opportunity to think about new missions that can prevent future global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
</div>

### Anticipatory Innovation
This is an emerging field focused on engaging with uncertainty and working with the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. It involves creating evidence about the future in the present to inform decision-making, utilizing tools like strategic foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. An example is the strategic foresight exercise with the government of Slovenia, imagining different future worlds (e.g., highly mobile elite, localized world, greater polarization, intergenerational interaction) to inform current policy decisions for the public sector's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

## Building Blocks and [[Principles of public sector innovation|Principles of Public Sector Innovation]]
Effective [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] requires foundational elements and principles:
*   **Long-term Commitment**: Building infrastructure for [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] takes time and consistent work over a long period. It's about playing "the long game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Political Engagement**: Politicians are accountable for public sector productivity and services. Their inclusion in [[public_sector_innovation|public sector innovation]] work and agendas is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **User Involvement**: Grounding [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] in design thinking and user engagement remains a core building block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Active involvement of users from the very beginning is of major importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.
*   **Cross-Silo Collaboration**: Learning to collaborate across silos is increasingly important for solving "wicked problems" like climate and demographic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Autonomy**: Bureaucracy can aid [[public_sector_innovation|public sector innovation]] through decentralized autonomy, allowing innovation and improvement in areas that don't require massive funding or major political decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
*   **[[Public sector innovation|Innovation]] as a Means, Not a Goal**: [[Public sector innovation|Innovation]] should be seen as a tool to achieve goals like greater efficiency and higher quality services, not an end in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.
*   **Knowledge and Competence Building**: Dedicated training programs for public administration employees are essential to change perspectives, workflow, problem-solving, and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>. This addresses the "lack of knowledge, skills, and tools" barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>.
*   **Community Building**: Fostering an [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] community and network of "innovation ambassadors" (individuals actively promoting [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] in their institutions) empowers people and facilitates knowledge sharing and good practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.
*   **Problem-Oriented Approach**: Focusing on concrete problems and their consequences works well with politicians and senior managers, linking [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] directly to visible issues they are responsible for fixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

## Barriers to [[Public sector innovation|Innovation]]
Common barriers identified by participants and panelists include:
*   Challenging the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>
*   Strict hierarchies and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>
*   Risk avoidance behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>
*   Lack of vision or strategic frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>
*   Funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>
*   Divergence between national and local governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>
*   The "magnetism of business as usual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>
*   Lack of flexibility and bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>
*   Fear of change and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>
*   Mindset, particularly the need for openness to new ideas and views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.
*   Lack of "social innovation skills" (collaboration, inclusion, co-creation, creativity, system thinking), and even primary skills like listening and thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.
*   Hierarchical approaches that limit employee potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>.
*   Lack of financial and political support; leaders want quick results but don't provide adequate support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.
*   Fear of losing control and fear of undesired results, making senior public servants hesitant to tackle issues in new ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.
*   Procurement rules can be a significant obstacle to experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
*   High mobility in civil service makes network investment difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

## Addressing Barriers and Championing [[Public sector innovation|Innovation]]
Strategies for fostering [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] and overcoming barriers:
*   **Just Start**: Don't wait for the entire system to be ready. Find windows of opportunity, coalitions of the willing, and open-minded people to start where it's possible and where it matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>.
*   **Build Trust and Relationships**: Engage with middle and senior management by understanding their objectives and showing how [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] can help them achieve desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>. Formalize roles (project owner, sponsor) to ensure accountability and mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>.
*   **Focus on Results**: When engaging senior leaders, accelerate the sharing of learnings and results, rather than just focusing on the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.
*   **Create Safe Experimental Spaces**: Establish environments where mistakes are allowed and multi-level cooperation can occur as part of an institutional learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.
*   **Leverage Networks**: Global networks allow for sharing good practices, meaning one doesn't have to "discover hot water" but can adapt existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Support**: Policies like Denmark's "free municipality experiments" demonstrate how exempting municipalities from certain regulations can provide a structural framework for experimentation, foster a culture of trying new things, and yield unexpected innovative results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>. Even implied barriers can be overcome by a mandate to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>.
*   **Empower Individuals**: Empowering individuals through community and ambassadorship programs helps drive [[public_sector_innovation|innovation]] from the bottom up, fostering a culture of cooperation and problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>.
*   **Integrate [[Public sector innovation|Innovation]] into Core Business**: [[Public sector innovation|Innovation]] should not be "whipped cream" or an afterthought, but part of the basic sustenance of government work, integrated into core functions where it truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:04">[01:25:04]</a>.

## Resources
The OPSI offers various resources to support [[public_sector_innovation|public sector innovation]]:

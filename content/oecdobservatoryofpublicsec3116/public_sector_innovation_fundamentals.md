This article explores the fundamentals of [[public sector innovation]], drawing insights from a webinar series and discussions with experts from Denmark, Belgium, and Slovenia. It delves into the definition of innovation in a government context, its importance, common [[public sector innovation challenges]], and different types of innovative activities.

## What is [[Public sector innovation]]?

A webinar series focused on understanding what [[public sector innovation]] truly is, its significance, and how to advance it within government contexts [00:00:20]. The discussion included insights from the Government Beyond Recovery conference, held in October in partnership with the Slovenian presidency of the Council of the European Union and the European Institute of Public Administration [00:01:38]. This conference reflected on how innovation provides an opportunity within crisis and recovery periods to transform government functions and address complex problems to improve public outcomes [00:01:56].

Initially, innovation might be perceived as a flashy, niche activity involving sticky notes and whiteboards, often confined to a few "innovation people" within a department rather than being systemic [00:06:54]. However, there is much more to it than this initial perception [00:07:12].

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) defines innovation based on three core pillars:
*   **Novelty**: It must be novel or new to the specific context [00:07:22].
*   **Implementation**: It must be implemented, meaning it moves beyond just an idea to actual action [00:07:28].
*   **Impact**: It should have an impact or shift public value, focusing on how innovations improve public outcomes and serve the public [00:07:35].

Understanding the impact of innovation is crucial; even if an implemented idea fails, it's important to learn from those failures, and if it succeeds, to understand why and how to leverage such approaches in the future [00:07:50].

OPSI's work involves:
*   Uncovering emerging practices and identifying what's next by looking at global trends [00:08:18].
*   Normalizing the idea that innovation can be a strategic resource for governments [00:08:25].
*   Providing trusted advice to individuals, governments, and public sector systems on advancing the innovation agenda [00:08:33].

## Why Innovate?

The COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrated the need for innovation, but the question remains how to sustain this momentum beyond immediate crises [00:08:47]. Key reasons to innovate include:
*   **Keeping pace with change**: Governments can be slow-moving and path-dependent, but innovation enables a proactive rather than reactive approach to change, new technology, new opportunities, and evolving contexts of uncertainty and volatility [00:09:01].
*   **Building trust**: Innovation helps build trust between governments and citizens by designing and delivering services that meet citizen needs [00:09:36]. The COVID-19 crisis showed how this relationship can strengthen or weaken, affecting policy adherence [00:09:40].
*   **Exploring uncertainty**: Innovation is a critical resource for exploring uncertainty, engaging with possible futures, and steering towards preferred outcomes [00:10:18].
*   **Improving public value**: Ultimately, governments serve the people, and innovation aims to improve public services and the lives of citizens [01:08:48].

### Confidence in Government's Ability to Face Challenges
A poll from the Government Beyond Recovery conference revealed varied confidence levels in government's ability to address complex challenges since the pandemic:
*   **Much less confident**: 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>
*   **Somewhat less confident**: 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>
*   **Neutral**: 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
*   **Somewhat more confident**: 34% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
*   **Much more confident**: 7.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>

Prime Minister Janez Jan≈°a stated at the conference, "If we talk about climate change, by far the biggest challenge is innovation. If we only deal with the consequences, we will never solve the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This highlights that governments cannot succeed by constantly reacting; a proactive, multi-sectoral, multi-stakeholder approach is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## [[Public sector innovation challenges]]

Participants identified several key challenges for delivering better public services and promoting innovation:
*   Lack of vision and leadership to move on from old ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   Reaching groups that feel forgotten or left behind, which involves building relationships through innovative methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

Guita Rickard emphasized, "If nothing happens, the political risk is higher than if something happens. Something has to happen and something has to change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The cost of inaction is often much higher than the cost of change, even if results aren't immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

A poll on public managers' eagerness to return to the status quo post-COVID-19 revealed:
*   **Eager to go back**: 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>
*   **Willing to acknowledge lessons learned but not to change behaviors/take action**: 52.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>
*   **Willing and ready to learn from crisis and adapt management methods**: 27% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>

Peter Pogachar noted, "One thing is clear: public administration should not mouse back to its normal old ways of working as they were before the pandemic, because the old ways of working will not be able to keep up with the fast-paced pace of changes in the workplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This also applies to the fast pace of change in the world [00:13:43].

### Common Barriers Identified by Participants

Participants in the webinar identified numerous barriers:
*   Challenges in proof of concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>
*   Strict hierarchies and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>
*   Risk avoidance behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>
*   Accreditation issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>
*   Managers not cooperating with employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>
*   Finding robust, secure, and scalable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>
*   Dealing with politics and skills gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>
*   Lack of vision or strategic frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>
*   Funding issues and divergence between national and local governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>
*   "Magnetism of business as usual" and tendency to stick to the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>
*   Lack of a unifying vision, flexibility, and bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>
*   Fear of change and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>

Matia Codra from Slovenia further categorized common barriers:
1.  **Mindset**: The biggest barrier is mindset; a willingness to be open to new ideas, views, and solutions is crucial [00:48:25].
2.  **Lack of knowledge, skills, and tools**: This includes a lack of "social innovation skills" such as collaboration, inclusion, co-creation, creativity, and system thinking, as well as primary skills like listening and thinking before jumping to solutions [00:48:45]. Problems should be well-defined first [00:49:10].
3.  **Hierarchical approaches**: These approaches limit the potential and knowledge of employees, making self-organized teams and progressive organizations, supported by transparency and trust, important solutions [00:49:40].
4.  **Lack of financial and political support**: Leaders often want quick results but don't provide the necessary knowledge and competence support for long-term change [00:50:06].
5.  **Fear of losing control and undesired results**: Especially with senior public servants, there's a fear of being seen as incompetent when invited to innovative problem-solving [00:50:23]. Promoting exchange of knowledge and systemic learning, including from both good and bad practices, helps overcome this [00:50:42].

Frederick Bob Futz from Belgium added that challenging the status quo often creates resistance because it questions people's established ways of working [00:52:14]. He highlighted procurement as a significant obstacle to experimentation, as complex internal rules block civil servants [00:53:30]. He advised working with open-minded individuals to form a "coalition of the willing" and engaging with management to build trust and connect innovation initiatives with their objectives [00:54:40].

## [[Public sector innovation methods and strategies]]

Traditional policymaking tools were designed for a predictable world, but introducing portfolios creates space for complexity and understanding how innovation can be used in different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.

OPSI's "innovation facets" framework provides a fundamental understanding of different types of innovation activities and how governments can systemically support innovation beyond a "sticky notes approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

### Types of Innovation Activities:

1.  **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation**: Characterized by quick wins and doing things better, often incremental improvements [01:14:45].
    *   **Example**: In the Canadian government, shifting to e-signatures or digital procedures from paper processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.
    *   **Systemic Improvement Example**: Estonia's proactive family benefit system, where the government is notified of a birth and proactively informs families of available services, reducing the burden on recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>.

2.  **Adaptive Innovation**: Involves adjusting to changing circumstances, highly visible during the COVID-19 crisis [01:16:11].
    *   **Example**: Forced shift to telework or adapting communication strategies due to increased reliance on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>.
    *   **Systemic Approach Example**: Japan's agile governance model, a constant cycle of understanding changing conditions and risks, setting new goals, developing new systems, implementing, and evaluating them [01:17:20]. This non-linear approach ensures policies and services continuously adapt to demographic shifts, media consumption changes, and other societal changes [01:17:49].

3.  **[[Public sector innovation strategies]] (Mission-Oriented Innovation)**: A strong approach for addressing difficult, complex targets like climate change [01:18:22].
    *   **European Commission Mission Areas**: Climate-neutral and smart cities, healthy oceans, adaptation to climate change, cancer, soil health, and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>.
    *   **Characteristics**: Involves a wide range of stakeholders (researchers, academia, private sector, civil society) collectively defining problems, developing solutions, implementing them, and understanding their impact [01:19:00]. It creates comprehensive coordination and collaborative mechanisms, collective long-term visions, institutional infrastructure, and supportive funding, procurement, and regulatory environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:29">[01:19:29]</a>.
    *   Perez Turner stated, "COVID-19 is the opportunity to actually think about new missions, missions that we can fulfill to not end up in global crises in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:49">[01:19:49]</a>.

4.  **Anticipatory Innovation**: A cutting-edge, emerging field focused on engaging with uncertainty and working with the future [01:20:12]. It aims to create evidence about the future in the present to inform decision-making, using tools like strategic foresight [01:20:24].
    *   **Example**: A report with the Slovenian government imagined four different future worlds (e.g., highly mobile elite, localized world with human touch, polarized world, world with intergenerational interaction) to understand implications for the public sector regarding aging and talent management [01:21:04]. This exercise helped identify policy decisions needed in the present to prepare the public sector for these possible futures [01:22:16].

### Building Blocks and Principles for Innovation

Speakers shared practical insights on building a strong foundation for innovation:

*   **Long-Term Infrastructure**: Lina Collierson from Denmark highlighted that building innovation infrastructure takes time; it's a "long game" requiring consistent work over extended periods, not just a year or two [01:30:41].
*   **Political Inclusion**: Politicians are accountable for public sector productivity and services. Their inclusion in [[public sector innovation]] work and agendas is crucial [01:31:27]. Supporting political leadership and strengthening collaboration between civil servants and politicians are key focuses [01:31:37].
*   **Visible and Legitimate Labs**: Having a visible innovation lab with high legitimacy and a relevant core business area helps strengthen the innovation agenda [01:32:37]. Innovation is not a "fun game we play in the corners" [01:32:41].
*   **Design Thinking and User Involvement**: Approaches strongly founded in design thinking and user involvement are core building blocks for [[public sector innovation]] [01:32:51].
*   **Collaborating Across Silos**: Denmark's long history of digital government demonstrates the importance of continuous collaborative work on digital infrastructure across all levels of government, often involving the private sector [01:33:00]. This teaches how to collaborate across silos, which is vital for addressing complex problems like climate and demographic challenges [01:33:30].
*   **Decentral Autonomy**: Bureaucracy can aid [[public sector innovation]] by allowing for "decentral autonomy" [01:34:25]. Where the entire system cannot be engaged, finding smaller areas with autonomy allows for innovation and improvement without massive funding or political decisions [01:34:35].
*   **Innovation as a Means, Not a Goal**: Innovation should be seen as a means to an end, a way to achieve better outcomes, such as a more efficient public sector and higher quality services and products [01:35:33].
*   **Problem-Oriented Approach**: Engaging senior managers and politicians effectively means focusing on the specific problems that need solving [01:06:40]. Framing complex issues (like demographics or climate change) as tangible problems requiring innovative solutions helps secure buy-in [01:07:01].
*   **Start by Starting**: Don't wait for the entire system to be ready. Find windows of opportunity, coalitions of the willing, and open-minded people. "You start by starting" where it's possible [01:24:25].
*   **Start Where It Matters**: Innovation should be embedded in the core business, not just seen as "whipped cream" or icing on the cake [01:25:04]. It should be part of the basic sustenance of public service [01:25:22].

Matia Codra from Slovenia emphasized:
*   **Time and Safe Environment**: Preconditions for innovative processes include having time to do things differently and establishing a safe experimental space where mistakes are allowed for institutional learning [01:48:01].
*   **Knowledge and Competences**: Training programs are crucial for employees to change perspectives on workflow and problem-solving [01:39:25].
*   **Innovation Community**: [[Public sector innovation and collaboration]] starts and ends with people. Skilled and motivated individuals are key to better solutions [01:39:55]. Platforms that allow networking, learning, support, and transfer of good practices are vital [01:40:06]. Slovenia's `innovative.si` project created a national cooperation platform that promotes cooperation and social innovation, destroying stereotypes and fostering collaboration between public administration and the private sector [01:57:50].
*   **Innovation Ambassadors**: Individuals who actively participate in the innovation community and their own work environment, acting as entry points and promoters within their institutions [01:40:40].
*   **User Involvement**: Active involvement of users from the very beginning is of major importance in designing solutions [01:38:57].
*   **Strategic Measurement**: Measuring innovation maturity in state administration bodies helps monitor progress and encourages engagement [01:59:32].

Frederick Bob Futz from Belgium recommended:
*   **Coalition of the Willing**: Work with open-minded people and don't waste energy on those who are resistant [01:22:18].
*   **Build Trust with Management**: Try to gain access to management, formally and informally, to build trust. Understand their objectives and show how innovation can help achieve them [01:08:39]. Listen to arguments against innovation, but focus on engaging those who are open to new approaches [01:55:30].
*   **Tackle Difficult Issues**: Sometimes, to get basic tools for [[public sector innovation]], it's necessary to actively take on challenging issues [01:53:05].

### The Role of Better Regulation

Better regulation policy can significantly contribute to building blocks for [[public sector innovation]].
*   **Digital Implementation Mandate**: In Denmark, new regulations must be implementable digitally, pushing for an innovative approach [01:16:48].
*   **Free Municipality Experiments**: Denmark has conducted "free municipality experiments" where municipalities apply for exemptions from specific regulations that hinder their desired innovations [01:17:23]. Parliament then decides on these exemptions, allowing municipalities to experiment. If successful, the exemption can be extended to all municipalities, creating a structural framework for experimentation [01:17:49].
*   **Cultural Impact**: These exemptions have a massive cultural impact, normalizing experimentation and making it "okay to try things out" [01:19:19]. This leads to innovation beyond the scope of the specific regulations, fostering a general mandate for trying new approaches [01:21:08].

## Resources and Tools

Several resources are available to support [[public sector innovation]]:
*   **Policy Briefs**: Comprehensive briefs about each innovation facet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Case Study Navigator**: An opportunity to explore innovative activities happening globally, potentially even in one's own country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Innovation Declaration**: A soft legal instrument from the OECD that 42 countries have adhered to, providing legitimacy for innovation within adhering countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Based on five key principles: embracing enhancement, encouraging and equipping public servants, cultivating new partnerships, supporting exploration and testing, and diffusing lessons learned [00:13:57]. A playbook on carrying this declaration forward in action is forthcoming in Spring [00:14:30].
*   **Toolkit Navigator**: An open-source database of resources on topics like design, social innovation, open government, and strategic design, allowing users to find helpful tools or submit their own [00:14:43].

[[Public sector innovation]] is a collective endeavor, emphasizing the human dimension of building relationships, fostering trust, and working with people to champion change [01:56:01]. The global context of recovery presents a crucial opportunity to leverage funding and the energy from governments' recent innovative responses to advance the innovation agenda [01:27:29].

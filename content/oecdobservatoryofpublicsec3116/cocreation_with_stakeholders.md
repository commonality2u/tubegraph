Co-creation involves stakeholders in identifying all dimensions of a problem or issue, and in designing and implementing solutions through a generative exchange of insights and ideas [00:03:51]. This process leads to more robust solutions and greater support for decisions made [00:00:22].

## Why Co-creation?

Co-creation is crucial for addressing complex problems where no single central authority can fully understand and control the system [00:29:02]. It is an informational problem, not merely a matter of being "nice" or "moral" [00:29:14]. By involving stakeholders, organizations gain a distributed learning capacity within the system [00:30:18].

### Distinction from Other Practices
Co-creation differs significantly from merely informing stakeholders (announcing decisions) [00:04:45] or consultative practices, such as online surveys asking for comments on a draft policy [00:05:11]. Unlike consultations, which often yield a series of monologues with controversial ideas, co-creation fosters a generative exchange where people "get together" to discuss, refine ideas, and align on a path forward [00:05:32].

## Key Elements and Success Factors

Effective [[cocreation_with_stakeholders | co-creation]] relies on several critical elements:

*   **Mindset and Openness** People must be open to new ideas, views, and opinions, as without knowledge and openness, there is no progress [00:41:10]. Leaders often seek quick results, but sustainable success requires the right support in terms of knowledge and competencies [00:41:24].
*   **Political Backing and Clear Purpose** It is crucial to have the political backing and momentum behind the process [00:37:07]. The purpose should be clear—defining the problem to be solved—while allowing participants to shape the outcome [00:37:17].
*   **Trust and Generative Exchange** [[trust_and_coordination_in_multistakeholder_partnerships | Building trust]] is essential, alongside a generative exchange of ideas where opinions are "ground against each other" so participants understand diverse viewpoints and work collaboratively rather than competitively [00:12:21]. Authenticity is key: "you say what you mean and you mean what you say" [00:39:06].
*   **Competent Hosting and Facilitation** A very advanced secretariat is needed to manage content, and a high-powered hosting team is required to facilitate the process [00:37:39]. These facilitation skills are distinct from traditional project management, requiring high emotional intelligence and social presence [00:49:19].
*   **Transparency and Open Documentation** [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | Co-creation]] processes should be fully transparent, with no secret meetings [00:12:16]. "Working out loud" involves openly documenting the process, questions, and reflections, sharing them on public platforms to allow for continuous input and challenge [01:04:46]. This openness also acts as a protection against lobbyists, as all discussions are out in the open, preventing back-door deals [01:11:15].
*   **Involving Diverse Voices** Efforts must be made to invite and encourage participation from all demographics to ensure true representation, not just the usual vocal groups [01:03:16]. This includes considering "future generations" as stakeholders who will experience significant impacts from current decisions, even if they are not physically present [00:31:06].
*   **Systemic Approach** Problems often transcend institutional boundaries, requiring a systemic or challenge-based approach where participation and co-creation play a major role [00:41:52].
*   **Strategic Intent and Learning Communities** Organizations need a strategic intent for change to incorporate [[cocreation_with_stakeholders | co-creation]] better [00:48:37]. Building [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | learning communities]] among all partners is fundamental to driving change, as co-creation is also about distributed learning [00:30:21].
*   **Implementation and Follow-up** After the co-creation process, it is important to adopt concrete commitments with clearly defined responsible parties and deadlines [00:43:30]. Regular communication with all participants about the progress of proposed solutions is crucial for understanding and trust, fostering further cooperation and motivation [00:43:43].

## Challenges and Pitfalls

Obstacles to [[engaging_stakeholders_in_innovation | engaging more stakeholders]] in [[cocreation_with_stakeholders | co-creating policies]] include:

*   **Hierarchical Mindset** [00:35:03]
*   **Lack of Participatory Knowledge, Skills, and Tools** [00:35:06]
*   **Time Consumption** While initially time-consuming, participatory processes lead to more effective implementation and public buy-in later [00:38:00].
*   **Rigid Regulatory Frameworks** Public organizations might be limited by inflexible legislation, procurement procedures, or austerity measures [00:46:49].
*   **Lack of Autonomy** Staff may lack the autonomy or willingness to give discretion to external stakeholders [00:47:54].
*   **"Silos" within Organizations** A lack or absence of silos within public organizations is important [00:48:21].
*   **Lack of Institutional Buy-in** If senior leadership (e.g., Director Generals, politicians) is control-oriented, it makes co-creation downstream very difficult [00:50:30].
*   **Difficulty Holding Uncertainty** Governments and institutions need to improve their ability to "hold uncertainty" rather than seeking definitive "truth" or quick answers [00:51:21]. This requires a "theory of care" within administration [00:51:46].

## Examples from the Field

### European Commission: Circular Plastics Alliance
The European Commission has used participatory engagement for over 10 years, including [[cocreation_process_with_oecd | co-creation with stakeholders]] and citizens [00:08:25]. The Circular Plastics Alliance aims to recycle 10 million tons of used plastic into new products annually by 2025 [00:08:56]. This complex problem involves a full value chain (chemical producers, designers, consumers, recyclers, public authorities, etc.) [00:09:11].

Instead of legislating, the Commission proposed creating an alliance, starting with a declaration and inviting value chain members to build it [00:09:56]. CEO-level industry and consumer groups participated, followed by 14 fully participatory working group meetings in Spring/Summer 2019 [00:10:16]. By September 2019, 120 signatories had agreed on a declaration [00:10:45].

> [!NOTE] Methods Used:
> Classic participatory techniques such as World Cafe, Open Space Technology, and Circle Practice were used. Some methods were developed specifically for the settings, like approving documents together [00:11:42]. Meetings were scripted down to the minute, yet participants felt complete freedom [00:12:05].

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the alliance transitioned online smoothly due to pre-established trust and relationships [00:13:30]. While informal conversations (coffee breaks, lunches) were missed, online formats allowed for greater reach, involving people who might have difficulty traveling [00:14:35]. The commission has trained about 3,000 officials in participatory methods, and continues to train about 120 per year [00:58:18]. This shift has been driven by younger officials, supported by buy-in from top leadership [00:57:51].

### Slovenia: Innovative.si Hub
The Innovative.si project in Slovenia aims to creatively resolve complex social challenges and provide knowledge and competences for new ways of working within the public administration [00:15:43]. Their vision is to strengthen innovation culture, especially in public administration, where top-down approaches are more common [00:16:01].

The project connects public sector challenges needing [[cocreation_with_stakeholders | co-creative problem-solving]] with internal or external facilitators [00:16:24]. Public sector employees are often part of the facilitation team to learn methods [00:16:38]. Solutions are developed through prototypes, with active involvement of users from the beginning [00:16:53]. A wide range of stakeholders, from end-users to policymakers, are considered crucial for true [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]] [00:17:05].

> [!INFO] Key Points for Innovative.si:
> 1.  **People are Key**: Beyond methodologies and tools, skilled and motivated people are central to inclusive and better solutions [00:17:30]. An innovation community platform was established for networking, learning, and support, growing to over 400 members from public, private, and academic sectors [00:17:41].
> 2.  **Innovative Ambassadors**: These individuals (currently 70) act as entry points in their institutions, promoting and facilitating co-creative problem-solving [00:18:19]. They actively participate in trainings and apply knowledge in their work environments [00:18:48].

### Cogo Digital Toolkit for Public Administrations
Developed by an international consortium and financed by Horizon 2020, the Cogo Digital Toolkit provides holistic support for public organizations implementing [[cocreation_with_stakeholders | co-creation]], with a focus on service level [00:20:41]. It comprises four tools, ideally used consecutively [00:21:19]:

*   **Coready**: Assesses an organization's readiness for [[cocreation_with_stakeholders | co-creation]] via a self-evaluation questionnaire [00:21:51]. It provides a roadmap for improvement and allows comparison with other organizations [00:22:31].
*   **Coserve**: Helps determine which public service is most suitable for renewal through [[cocreation_with_stakeholders | co-creation]] [00:23:51].
*   **Corenew**: Actively includes service users in the service renewal process, building on user journey mapping to gather problems and ideas for improvement [00:24:50].
*   **Comaster**: Assesses the quality of co-creation during public service renewal, helping identify areas for future improvement [00:25:34].

### Dark Matter Labs: Mental Health in Sweden
For complex, multi-actor problems like mental health (involving schools, workplaces, neighborhoods), a "whole community" approach is needed [00:32:51]. In Sweden, the Mind Shift community was built because no single government agency could drive change [00:33:11]. This community fostered awareness of interdependencies (e.g., between employee treatment and social costs) and became a critical public movement [00:33:24]. In such situations, politicians' role shifts from providing answers to "holding space" and ensuring the integrity of the process, embarking on a learning journey with participants [00:33:52].

## Future Directions and Critical Reflections

*   **Continuous Co-creation**: For complex, evolving problem domains, [[cocreation_with_stakeholders | co-creation]] must be a continuous act, not a one-off linear process [00:28:42].
*   **Reimagining Institutions and Democracy**: Current administrative frameworks may be "fundamentally broken" for making complex decisions in an emerging world [00:31:38]. A "structural reboot" of institutional frameworks is needed to create effective co-creation processes [00:32:04].
*   **Policy Architecture in Crisis**: Crises like COVID-19 highlight that current policy-making processes are not fast or agile enough [00:54:14]. They reveal the need for parametric, iterative policy-making that continuously adapts based on data, even weekly [00:54:40]. This requires fundamental rewiring of government and different communication/participation with the public [00:54:59].
*   **Beyond Stakeholders vs. Citizens**: The distinction between "stakeholders" and "citizens" should dissolve; "stakeholders are citizens" [00:55:47]. The use of citizen juries and citizen assemblies is becoming a key deliberative framework in this context [00:56:06].
*   **Institutional Care**: To foster effective co-creation, institutions need to be designed to "care" — to be open, to deal with open-ended questions and outcomes, and to recognize the critical role of others in delivery [00:51:46].
*   **Budgeting for Agility**: Current public budgeting processes (e.g., European Commission budgets planned two years in advance) are cumbersome and hinder agile, iterative policy development [00:58:49]. A reflection on how to structure public budget making is needed to support agile responses to challenges [00:59:17].

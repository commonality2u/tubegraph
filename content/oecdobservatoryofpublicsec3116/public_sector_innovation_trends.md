This article summarizes key trends in [[public_sector_innovation_and_global_trends | public sector innovation]] as discussed in a webinar by the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The OPSI's mission is to provide trusted advice to governments on achieving [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, uncover what's next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, and help embed innovation as a daily part of life within governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Tracking Global Trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>

The OPSI's work on tracking [[global_trends_in_public_sector_innovation | global trends in public sector innovation]] is based on a large annual crowdsourcing exercise for innovations, combined with in-depth research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. For a recent year, 552 innovations from 84 countries were surfaced and analyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The goals of this work include surfacing new ideas, preparing for what's next, building a network of innovators, duplicating success, reducing the impact of failure, and speeding up the innovation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

The report identifies three main trends in [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]]:
1.  Invisible to Visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>
2.  Opening Doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>
3.  Machine-Readable World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>

### Invisible to Visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>

This trend highlights the maturity of existing approaches and the application of new ones, often through the merger of different methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*   **Behavioral Insights (Nudges) and Gamification**: Governments are increasingly using behavioral insights (often called nudges) to understand human motivations and encourage desired actions like paying taxes on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Over 200 government-related behavioral insights units have emerged in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Gamification is moving beyond traditional workshops to "serious games" and other methods to innovate on previous work and combat "workshop fatigue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. An example is the European Commission's scenario exploration system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Carrot Rewards (Canada)**: This national wellness rewards platform combines gamification and behavioral insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. It addresses rising healthcare costs by encouraging healthy behaviors, offering points for activities like meeting walking goals or completing quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. These points can be redeemed through loyalty programs, which are very popular in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The app partnered with a flu campaign, sending push notifications and geo-localization quizzes, which led to 30,000 people taking flu shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **Immersive Technologies**: Technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have become more affordable, leading governments to use them for new and immersive ways to engage citizens, especially those not typically involved in political processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Finding Places (Hamburg, Germany)**: An MIT lab worked with Hamburg's government, using augmented reality and Lego blocks on demonstration boards to allow citizens to physically build potential refugee location sites in their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Citizen Science**: Governments are leveraging the collective power of citizens to make observations and tackle scientific challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. There's a growing maturity in this model with systemic use and thousands of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Zika Mozzie Seeker (Queensland, Australia)**: Thousands of citizen scientists were activated to deploy traps, catch mosquitoes, and send samples to DNA labs for testing to alert authorities about Zika virus carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Positive Deviance**: Governments are studying "positive outliers" in society to understand what factors lead to their success and whether those can be broadly generalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The United Nations Development Program's work in Pakistan studying young women who achieved career success in difficult regions is an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### Opening Doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>

This trend focuses on how governments are making participation and benefits more accessible for at-risk and underserved populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

*   **New Currency**: This refers to non-monetary common goods that people can exchange for social rewards or welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. This trend is increasingly connected to sustainability and the circular economy, where efforts aim to combine environmental benefits with economic catalysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Recyclables as Transportation Fare (Surabaya, Indonesia)**: Launched in 2018, this initiative allows citizens to pay for bus fare with recyclable plastic bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Indonesia, a large producer of plastic waste with a low recycling rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>, uses this program to reduce waste and make transportation more accessible for citizens without economic means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   **Platform Economy**: The concept of government acting as a platform for services is becoming more real, similar to private sector platforms like Airbnb or Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Underutilized Government Buildings (Amsterdam)**: A pilot in Amsterdam explored using underutilized government buildings in evenings or weekends for public good, addressing challenges like security and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   **Access to Justice**: New technologies and open data are rapidly increasing access to justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Clear My Records (California, USA)**: This civil society project used open records to identify people with criminal records for offenses no longer illegal in California, helping them expunge records to improve employment and social mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

### Machine-Readable World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>

This trend reflects the shift towards governments leveraging machine-readable data and exploring emerging technologies. Governments have learned from initiatives to open up data, seeing its power as fuel for innovation and economic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. There is also growing interest in emerging technologies like blockchain and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

*   **Machine-Readable Laws and Policies**: Governments are converting laws, policies, and rules into machine-readable formats that can trigger automatic changes, ensuring the intent of laws matches their implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Better Rules (New Zealand)**: New Zealand is converting legislation into machine-readable code using programmatic terms to ensure clarity, precision, and consistent definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. This allows for instantaneous application by computers and provides a clear, authoritative source for legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. Examples include the Rates Rebate Act and the Holidays Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
*   **Machine Learning for Land Mapping**: Governments are converting geographical surroundings into machine-readable and consumable code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Queensland, Australia**: Manual land mapping processes are being replaced by satellite imagery and machine learning to make land features machine-readable for various uses like disaster management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.
*   **Emerging Technology Pilots**: Initial pilots are seen in several countries for mission-driven projects using emerging technologies to solve major problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
    *   **Case Study: Counterfeit Medicines (Mongolia)**: A pilot combined blockchain and AI to remedy the issue of counterfeit medicines, which account for 40% of all medicines in Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. The aim is to create an immutable record of transactions to detect anomalous readings or unauthorized entries into the workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
*   **Ethical Considerations**: It's crucial for governments to consider ethical implications when trying out new approaches, particularly with emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Governments need ethical frameworks to ensure a positive role in pursuing these technologies and minimize negative effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

## The Edge of Government Experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>

The work on global trends culminates in the "Edge of Government Experience," an immersive event held as part of the World Government Summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. This event takes selected case studies and transforms them into interactive experiences, allowing people to engage directly with the innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.

In a recent year, the theme was "Powered by You," reflecting that every initiative and decision contributes to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. Specific themes featured at the event included:

*   **Empower the Refugee**: Showcasing cases from Switzerland and Germany, focusing on integrating refugees into society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.
*   **Design Your Digital Twin**: Featuring "Aurora" from Finland, a project where a digital twin helps individuals make decisions about work, life, and home based on their data, acting as a digital mentor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   **Activate Your Mind**: Highlighted the Canadian Carrot Rewards project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.
*   **Hack Your City Routines**: Featured around 40 cities, showing how citizens can interact with their city. Examples included an app from the Netherlands allowing elderly people to "hack" traffic lights for longer crossing times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>, a case from Pakistan using biofuel made from cow manure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>, and the Indonesia recyclables as currency initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.
*   **The Massive City**: From Wisconsin, this theme discussed how artificial intelligence helps the Singaporean government predict if a bus driver might have an accident based on studying driver behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.
*   **Hyper-charge Your Harvest**: A project from China demonstrating the use of electricity to grow more organic plants and reduce pesticide use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

## Factors for Success in Public Sector Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>

Success in [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] is often linked to the presence of specific positive factors:

*   **Not Reinventing the Wheel**: Governments should avoid creating solutions from scratch when similar efforts, including failures that led to successes, have been undertaken elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. Curiosity and exploration beyond national borders are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.
*   **Diverse Points of View**: Ensuring a wide range of perspectives are considered in the decision-making process can prevent misassumptions and better meet public needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.
*   **Multidisciplinary Approaches**: Bringing together experts from different fields (e.g., policy analysts, lawyers, designers, coders) to collectively examine a problem leads to better solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.
*   **Building Ethics into the Process**: Ethical considerations should be integrated at every step of an initiative to ensure positive outcomes and prevent unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. An ethical framework can help ask key questions throughout the project lifecycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.
*   **Framing the Problem Correctly**: Success is often tied to correctly framing the problem, continuously questioning assumptions, and testing hypotheses, rather than implementing a predetermined solution for a static problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.
*   **Iterative Approaches**: To mitigate risk in innovation, especially when results are uncertain, breaking projects into smaller chunks and iterating is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. This allows for assessing results, learning, and deciding next steps, rather than following a rigid, predetermined plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>.
*   **Appropriate Methodologies and Tools**: Using the right approaches and methods for specific problems, as guided by models like OPSI's facets model, is vital for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.

## Government's Role in Emerging Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>

The role of government in shaping and regulating emerging technologies is complex and varies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>. While OPSI doesn't take a stance on direct regulation of private industry, it advocates for governments to engage with nascent emerging technologies to better understand them and their potential impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. This engagement allows for more educated decisions, especially concerning issues that might become problematic later (e.g., social media platforms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. Hands-on experience and knowledge are crucial for effective procurement and requirement development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.

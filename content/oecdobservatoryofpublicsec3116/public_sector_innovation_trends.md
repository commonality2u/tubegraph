This article summarizes key insights from a webinar presented by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation (MBRCGI). The webinar discussed [[global public sector innovation trends|global public sector innovation trends]] and how governments are approaching them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## About the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI)

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) is a team of about ten people within the larger OECD framework of 3,000 individuals, based in Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

OPSI's three-pronged mission focuses on:
*   **Providing Trusted Advice** to governments on achieving [[public sector innovation|public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This includes direct one-on-one reviews of national innovation systems (e.g., Canada, Brazil) and country-specific workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Uncovering What's Next** by tracking [[global trends in public sector innovation|global trends]] and understanding future possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Turning the New into Normal** by providing tools, resources, and frameworks to embed innovation into daily governmental operations, moving beyond ad-hoc exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

OPSI collaborates with the Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation (MBRCGI), which aims to stimulate and enrich the culture of innovation within the UAE government sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. MBRCGI also tracks global innovations and showcases them at the "Edge of Government" experience during the World Government Summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Methodology for Tracking Trends

OPSI identifies key [[public sector innovation trends|public sector innovation trends]] through:
*   A large annual crowdsourcing exercise (call for innovations), which has grown each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   In-depth research conducted by the OPSI team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

For the latest report, 552 innovations from 84 different countries were surfaced and analyzed over several months, often involving visits and meetings with innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

The goals of this trend-tracking work include:
*   Surfacing new ideas and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   Preparing for what's next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   Facilitating a network of innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Embedding and duplicating success while reducing the impact of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   Speeding up the innovation process by enabling learning and leveraging others' work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Key Global Public Sector Innovation Trends

The report identifies three main [[global trends in public sector innovation|global trends in public sector innovation]]:

### 1. Invisible to Visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>
This trend reflects the increasing maturity and new applications of existing concepts, combined with the emergence of novel approaches. It bundles several sub-trends:

*   **Behavioral Insights (Nudges) & Gamification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>:
    *   Governments are using behavioral insights (or "nudges") to understand human motivations and steer citizens towards desired actions, such as paying taxes on time or contributing to retirement accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Over 200 government behavioral insights units have emerged globally in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
    *   Gamification is moving beyond traditional "post-it based workshops" to "serious games" and other methods that offer new approaches to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. OPSI's toolkit navigator provides access to dozens of such games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
    *   An example of combining these two is **Carrot Rewards** in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
        *   **Carrot Rewards:** Canada's national wellness rewards platform uses gamification and behavioral insights to understand citizen motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The app rewards users with points for healthy behaviors (e.g., meeting walking goals, completing quizzes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. These points can be redeemed through loyalty programs, which are very popular in Canada (90% participation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. The initiative aims to reduce healthcare costs and promote citizen well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. A partnership with a flu campaign led 30,000 people to get flu shots through app reminders and geo-localization quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

*   **Uptake in Immersive Technologies**: Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are becoming more affordable, leading governments, particularly at the local level, to use them for engaging citizens in new ways, including those not typically involved in political processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. An example is "Finding Places" in Hamburg, Germany, where an MIT lab uses AR and Lego blocks to allow citizens to physically build potential refugee location sites and discuss accommodations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

*   **Maturity in Citizen Science Efforts**: Governments are increasingly leveraging citizens' collective power to make observations and tackle scientific challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This model shows great maturity with systemic use and thousands of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. An example is "Zika Mozzie Seeker" in Queensland, Australia, where thousands of citizen scientists deploy traps to catch mosquitoes for DNA testing, alerting authorities to the presence of Zika virus carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

*   **Positive Deviance**: Governments are studying "positive outliers" in society to understand success factors that can be generalized more broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The UN Development Program in Pakistan, for instance, studies young women who achieved career success in challenging environments to replicate these successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

### 2. Opening Doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>
This trend addresses the increasing complexity that makes it difficult for citizens to participate in government and access public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. It focuses on how governments are making things more accessible for at-risk and underserved populations.

*   **New Currency Models**: Beyond traditional monetary currency, governments are exploring alternative forms of exchange for social rewards or welfare, often linked to sustainability efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This connects to the idea of a "circular economy" where products are designed for reuse and economic catalysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.
    *   An example is **Recyclables as Transportation Fare** in Surabaya, Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
        *   **Recyclables as Transportation Fare:** Launched in 2018, citizens can pay for bus fare with recyclable plastic bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This initiative addresses Indonesia's significant plastic waste problem, aiming to reduce waste and make transportation more accessible for those with limited economic means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. For about two hours of travel, the exchange rate is approximately three 1.5-liter bottles or five 600-milliliter bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

*   **Platform Economy in Government**: Applying the "as a service" model seen in private sector apps (e.g., Airbnb, Uber) to the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. The idea is that government can act as a platform for various services. An example is a pilot in Amsterdam exploring the use of underutilized government buildings (e.g., in evenings, weekends) for public good, addressing issues like security and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

*   **Access to Justice**: New technologies and open data are rapidly increasing access to justice, a core tenet of democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. An example from civil society is the "Clear My Records" project in California, which used open criminal records data to identify and help individuals expunge old, no-longer-illegal offenses, improving their social mobility and employment chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

These sub-trends highlight how increasing transparency, data availability, and new technologies allow for new possibilities and adapt popular private sector business models to meet public demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.

### 3. Machine-Readable World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>
This trend reflects governments' experience with making data machine-readable and their growing interest in emerging technologies like Blockchain and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>. Governments are now looking to reformat inputs and information dissemination methods to be machine-readable and consumable, feeding into algorithms and emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

*   **Converting Rules into Machine-Readable Formats**: This involves making laws, policies, and rules interpretable by machines to trigger automatic changes and ensure legislative intent matches implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
    *   An example is **Better Rules** in New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.
        *   **Better Rules:** New Zealand is working to convert legislation into machine-readable code, ensuring that the law's original intent matches its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. This addresses issues of inconsistent definitions and interpretation difficulties in human-written laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Software developers translate rules into clear, precise programmatic terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>, allowing for instantaneous application by computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. Case studies included the Rates Rebate Act (reducing home ownership costs for low-income individuals) and the Holidays Act (guaranteeing four weeks of holiday for employees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. This approach shortens feedback loops between legislative intent and implementation and provides a clear, authoritative source for legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

*   **Machine Learning for Land Mapping**: Governments are converting geographical surroundings into machine-readable and consumable code. Queensland, Australia, uses satellite imagery and machine learning to automate land mapping, a process previously done manually by surveyors, for purposes like disaster management response and land use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

*   **Initial Pilots of Emerging Technologies**: Governments are moving into testing and piloting emerging technologies for mission-driven projects aimed at solving significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. An example is a test in Mongolia combining Blockchain and AI to combat counterfeit medicines, which account for 40% of all medicines and lead to thousands of injuries and deaths annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.

*   **Ethical Considerations**: It is crucial for governments to focus on the ethical implications of these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>. An example of a controversial use is China's Social Credit system, which converts human decisions and characteristics into data for social credit scores with real-world implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. OPSI's report covers models for considering ethics throughout the lifecycle of such initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. The government's role may shift from providing services to providing safeguards and assurances for decentralized systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>. Governments need to engage with emerging technologies when they are nascent to better understand their potential impact and make educated decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.

## Success Factors and Preventing Failures in Public Sector Innovation

OPSI focuses on identifying factors that lead to success, noting that a lack of these factors often leads to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. Key success factors include:

*   **Not Reinventing the Wheel**: Governments often waste time trying to create something from scratch that has already been done elsewhere, missing opportunities to duplicate or replicate existing successes and learn from past failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. Being curious and exploratory, looking beyond national borders, is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Diverse Points of View**: Projects need diverse perspectives, especially from outside the immediate working group, to avoid misassumptions and ensure solutions meet the needs of a broader range of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.
*   **Supporting Multidisciplinary Approaches**: Bringing together experts from different fields (e.g., policy analysts, lawyers, designers, coders) helps address problems from multiple angles and find optimal solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.
*   **Building Ethics into Every Step**: Ethical considerations should be integrated from the beginning of a project to ensure a positive role in pursuing emerging technologies and prevent unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. OPSI's report provides an ethical framework for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.
*   **Correct Problem Framing**: Success often hinges on correctly framing the problem, continuously questioning assumptions, and testing hypotheses, rather than accepting a predetermined, static problem and implementing a fixed solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.
*   **Iterative Implementation**: For truly innovative endeavors, where results are uncertain, mitigating risk involves iteration—doing things in chunks, assessing results, learning, and then deciding the next step, instead of rigidly following a predetermined plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.
*   **Using Appropriate Methodologies**: Applying the right approaches and methodologies for specific problems is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. OPSI's "facets model" categorizes innovation types (e.g., top-down, bottom-up, high/low uncertainty) and links them to appropriate methods and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>.

## Edge of Government Experience

The "Edge of Government" experience is an annual event at the World Government Summit where selected case studies are transformed into immersive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. It goes beyond typical exhibitions, allowing attendees to engage directly with the innovation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. For example, for the Carrot Rewards project, attendees could walk around, have their steps calculated, and hypothetically redeem points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

The 2019 theme, "Powered by You," highlighted that every initiative, event, and decision by a person or civil servant contributes to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

Other themes and case studies featured at the event include:
*   **Working with and Empowering the Refugee**: Cases from Switzerland and Germany showcasing how empowering and integrating refugees benefits society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.
*   **Meet Your Digital Twin**: Finland's "Aurora" project, where a digital twin helps users make decisions based on their data, acting as a "digital mentor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.
*   **Activate Your Mind**: Featuring the Canadian Carrot Rewards project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>.
*   **See How You Hack Your City Routines**: Featuring approximately 40 cities demonstrating how individuals can influence city operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Netherlands: Elderly people using a phone app to extend traffic light crossing times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a>.
    *   Pakistan: Using biofuel made from cow manure to replace gasoline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.
    *   Singapore/Indonesia: The "Recyclables as Transportation Fare" initiative, where plastic bottles are used as currency for bus travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.
*   **The Massive City**: From Wisconsin, where artificial intelligence predicts if a bus driver will be involved in an accident using machine learning techniques and algorithms to study driver behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.
*   **Hyper-Charged Your Harvest**: A project from China using electricity to grow organic plants and reduce pesticide use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

The Edge of Government Award was presented to the Canadian government for its Carrot Rewards case study at the World Government Summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

The OPSI and MBRCGI are committed to building a network of innovators to connect, collaborate, and learn from each other to tackle complex global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. This includes providing platforms for case studies, community discussions, and toolkits to help governments leverage existing knowledge and apply it to their own contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.

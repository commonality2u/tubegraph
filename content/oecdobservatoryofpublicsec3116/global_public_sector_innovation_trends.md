The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), in partnership with the UAE's Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation, has been actively engaged in surfacing [[public_sector_innovation_trends | public sector innovation trends]] since 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This collaboration has resulted in 11 reports to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, observing a shift from small pockets of innovation to more systemic and technologically advanced levels over a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Research Methodology

The 2023 Trends report is fueled by two primary inputs:
*   **Global Open Crowdsourcing** An annual "Call for Innovations" exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, which this year surfaced 714 cases from 94 different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **OPSI's Own Research** An additional 370 cases found through OPSI's research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

In total, approximately 1100 cases contributed to synthesizing this year's trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Top submitting countries include Brazil (over 100 cases), Greece (53), Korea (36), Colombia (35), Turkey (35), Mexico (19-24), UAE (19-24), UK (19-24), Argentina (19-24), and Spain (19-24) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Hundreds of these case studies are being published on OPSI's case study library, which currently holds about 700 different innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The submission window for innovations is always open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Key Findings and Trends

The 2023 Trends report will launch its four primary trends at the World Government Summit in Dubai, scheduled for February 13th to 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

In addition to the primary trends, four secondary trends were identified, which are considered potential primary trends for the future due to their significant presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>:

*   **Public Administration Transformation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
*   **New Foundations for Youth and Intergenerational Justice** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   **Accelerating the Path to Net Zero** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   **Strengthening and Leveraging GovTech Ecosystems and Partnerships with Innovative Startups** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>

## Featured Innovation Projects

Several projects illustrate these secondary trends:

### Accelerated Capability Environment (ACE), UK Home Office
This initiative, established in 2017, focuses on achieving results with contemporary science, technology, digital opportunities, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. ACE works by building new trust across sectors, bringing organizations together for problem-solving, and operating with speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. It functions on a business-like basis, funded by the value delivered to public sector customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Over five years, ACE has delivered over 80 commissions for several dozen public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Key examples include:
*   Improving the UK government's response to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   Developing online age assurance standards for children's safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.
*   Intervening in justice for victims of modern slavery and violence against women and girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
*   Addressing harm to immigrants entering the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

### Future Mentors Program, City of Espoo, Finland
This reversed mentoring program connects young people with city decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. Its aim is to bridge the gap between youth and decision-makers, creating dialogue and mutual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. Young mentors lead sessions, focusing on themes important to them, such as their hopes, dreams, and fears for a sustainable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. A pilot program involved 94 mentors from 26 cities in the Eurocities Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. Dreams often centered on participation, public transport, and housing, while fears included climate crisis, unemployment, inequality, and poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. The program has led to the establishment of youth councils and continued collaboration on youth participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

### Digital Decarbonization, Loughborough University
This research explores the carbon footprint of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. Data centers, which house cloud data, account for about 3% of global carbon emissions, exceeding the aviation industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. Data is doubling every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. A significant issue is "dark data" (data used once or never) which constitutes 65% of stored data, and outdated data, making up another 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. The project emphasizes the need for better information governance in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. Researchers are developing a globally agreed measurement for data carbon emissions to be incorporated into government policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. They propose a "data carbon ladder" as a proactive approach to address data's carbon footprint from origin to end-user use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.

### National AI Supercomputing Platform, Government of Serbia
Serbia has prioritized technology and innovation since 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. The ICT sector is now Serbia's largest net exporting sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>. In 2022, Serbia ranked among the top 10 countries globally for e-government progress (UN) and 4th in Europe (World Bank GovTech maturity index) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. Serbia established its national AI strategy in 2019, making it the first country in Southeastern Europe and 26th globally to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

The National AI Platform, launched in 2021, is housed in the state data center in Kragujevac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. This Nvidia-based supercomputer system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:59">[00:50:59]</a> is offered free of charge to all stakeholders in the Serbian AI ecosystem, including faculties, science institutes, and startup companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>. This access significantly reduces the financial barrier for startups, as commercial platforms can cost tens of thousands of Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. The platform currently serves 24 institutions and 19 startup companies, with a dedicated support team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>.

Serbia is further fostering its AI and GovTech ecosystem through:
*   Membership in EuroHPC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>.
*   Membership in the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.
*   Joining the Digital Euro program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.
*   Launching a GovTech program with GIZ and the World Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>.
*   A dedicated grant competition for GovTech startups from the Innovation Fund of Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>.
*   Strong bilateral partnerships, particularly with the United Arab Emirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

The European Public Sector Award (EPSA) serves as a platform to showcase and analyze projects and good practices in public administration. The 2021 event features discussions relying on case studies and projects submitted for the award, as well as other effective practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This provides a space to reflect on [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation in the public administration]], understand its importance, identify challenges, and explore ways to overcome them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Featured Projects

Several projects presented at the event were either submitted for or inspired by the EPSA awards, demonstrating different facets of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]]:

### LabX (Portugal)
LabX is an experimental project from Portugal, launched in 2017 and supported by the Portuguese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Its core ambition is to foster [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] by creating an open and safe space for experimentation and promoting innovative solutions in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The project was designed to test solutions before full implementation, aiming to learn from mistakes and reduce risks and costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

LabX has achieved significant results:
*   25 experimental projects carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   Over 10,000 citizens engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   More than 2,000 public servants involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   Over 160 [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]] organizations participated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

The project is now evolving from a strict experimentation lab to an ambitious center for promoting [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation in public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. LabX's approach aligns with principles that were later shaped by the [[oecd_declaration_on_public_sector_innovation | OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. It has also helped integrate new projects into Portugal's Simplex program, focused on administrative and regulatory simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

### Gov Buys Innovation (Belgium)
This initiative, shortlisted for the EPSA awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>, is led by Nedo, an [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] lab for the Belgian federal government in the Flemish region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. The project aims to create an interactive marketplace for modern public procurement, focused on testing new solutions with limited budgets before scaling them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. Gov Buys Innovation is not a new procurement platform but a marketplace bringing together public sector entities and innovative companies to dialogue and solve real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

The project addresses challenges like the traditional public sector's reliance on large companies, slow implementation, and a lack of willingness among civil servants to try new services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. It supports smaller, innovative companies through the tendering process and focuses on problem statements rather than predefined solutions, allowing companies to propose how they would solve a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.

### Partnership for Change (Slovenia)
From Slovenia's Ministry of Public Administration, "Partnership for Change" is a program that began in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. It facilitates a maximum five-day exchange program for employees between the public and private sectors, as well as within the public sector itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>. This voluntary, interest-based exchange aims to break stereotypes about both sectors and foster understanding of how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>.

The program has seen over 300 employees exchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>, building trust and expanding networks between sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:44">[00:52:44]</a>. It operates as a "training on the field," allowing participants to learn practical skills like project management in real environments or understand how public strategies and e-services are developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. The program also organizes competitions to gather and solve challenges from various sectors, contributing to a culture of cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.

## Role of the EPSA in Fostering Innovation
The EPSA awards, along with platforms like the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), are recognized as excellent means to share lessons learned, innovative solutions, and examples across national and international scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The projects highlighted demonstrate a common ambition:
*   **Experimentation and Learning:** Testing new solutions and learning from successes and failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Challenging the Status Quo:** Overcoming taboos and encouraging collaboration with diverse partners, including other public services and private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
*   **Citizen and Business Focus:** Designing solutions that address real needs of citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Cultural Shift:** Moving beyond bureaucratic and hierarchical structures towards a more open and curious mindset where [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] is everyone's responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>. This also involves empowering civil servants and managers with autonomy and tools to solve challenges differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>.

The quick and efficient reaction of public bodies to develop projects and respond to challenges, particularly during crises like the pandemic, has been seen as inspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. This highlights the inherent innovative capacity within public administrations, often driven by the need to deal with complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

This article outlines how to [[integration_of_strategic_foresight_in_mission_development | integrate strategic foresight]] into government organizations, drawing on insights from the OECD, the Government of Flanders, and other national and regional public sector entities.

## What is Strategic Foresight?

[[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | Strategic foresight]] is defined as the ability to constantly perceive, make sense of, and act on the future in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Its primary purpose is not to predict the future, but to enable better decision-making today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This approach helps in making better prepared decisions and future-proofing current actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

[[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | Strategic foresight]] offers a structured, participatory, inclusive, impactful, and systemic approach to examining future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. It typically addresses medium to long-term futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, in volatile areas like artificial intelligence, the medium-term future can be a matter of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, prediction models were only precise for a few weeks, necessitating the integration of [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | scenario approaches]] due to high uncertainty levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Benefits of Strategic Foresight

[[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | Strategic foresight]] helps organizations to:
*   Set priorities and steer policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Identify challenges and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   Invest in innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Stress-test current decisions, policies, and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   Build shared visions and success stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

It involves various methods, approaches, and capabilities, ranging from forecasting and predicting to anticipating and exploring different types of futures for better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Integrating Strategic Foresight: Case Studies and Approaches

The OECD is working on anticipatory good practice principles to build a governance system that allows for effective [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This includes engaging with uncertainty, ensuring policy cycle continuity, and fostering [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | transformative innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Government of Flanders: A Blueprint for Integration

The Government of Flanders, in collaboration with the OECD, has developed a blueprint for [[integration_of_strategic_foresight_in_mission_development | integrating strategic foresight]] into its multi-level government system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This initiative, spurred by the COVID-19 crisis, aims to generate anticipatory intelligence to support policymaking in volatile and uncertain times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

[[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | Foresight]] involves:
*   **Crossing boundaries of time**: Looking at the past, present, and long-term future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Crossing policy domains**: Addressing complex challenges that are not neatly packaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Crossing different actors**: Collaborating with government entities, academia, EU institutions, and other initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

To ensure effective [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_policy_making | foresight in policymaking]], four core functions have been identified:

1.  **Discover**: Involves trend and weak signal analysis, requiring dedicated time and skilled personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
2.  **Explore**: Makes sense of discoveries through Horizon scanning, pattern and system analysis, and science-to-policy dialogues with the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This function generates anticipatory intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
3.  **Map**: Connects intelligence to current policymaking by mapping opportunities and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This includes building [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | explorative scenarios]] and utilizing resilient indicators to understand future potential and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
4.  **Create**: Focuses on impact and scale by developing visions and roadmaps, and building coalitions for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This emphasizes collaborative recovery and resilience-building efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

**Examples from Flanders**:
*   **Explore function**: In 2022, Flanders collaborated with the research fund (FWO Flanders) and the Netherlands (WRR) to bring scientists and policymakers together across five themes to exchange knowledge and identify leverage points for government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
*   **Mapping function**: Last year, Flanders, with ten other European regions, explored [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | scenarios]] for a resilient Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This involved analyzing mega-trends, building a scenario framework (e.g., "smart optimism," "hyper competition"), and linking it with Horizon scanning using digital platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Workshops with video images immersed participants in these [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | different worlds]] to explore common challenges and potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

### Finland: Integrating into Policy Cycles

Finland possesses a multi-layered system for [[public_sector_and_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]], including a Committee for the Future in Parliament, a strategic foresight team in the Prime Minister's Office, and Citra (a fund that produces megatrend reports and facilitates national dialogues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. Despite these assets, the OECD identified an "impact gap" in integrating these activities into core government processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

To bridge this gap, [[integration_of_strategic_foresight_in_mission_development | integration of anticipatory governance]] into everyday policy cycles is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. This involves a dialogue between [[understanding and utilizing strategic foresight | strategic foresight]] specialists, policymakers, civil servants, and decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. Proper integration leads to greater policy coherence, reflected in budgeting, management, and ultimately, more impactful and effective [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | innovation activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.

### Estonia: Evidence-Informed Policymaking

Estonia's Foresight Center, linked to the Parliament, aims to inform the public and Parliament members about alternative scenarios, future risks, and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>. They actively seek input from Parliament members for topics to be tackled using [[understanding and utilizing strategic foresight | foresight methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.

Key strategies for [[evidenceinformed_policymaking_using_strategic_foresight | evidence-informed policymaking]] include:
*   **Message uptake**: Success is measured when Parliament members adopt and convey the foresight messages, providing strong input to Ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.
*   **Direct Ministry involvement**: Steering committees for each topic include Parliament members and Ministry representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.
*   **Proactive media engagement**: Using media to amplify messages, as MPs tend to take insights more seriously when reported by journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
*   **Combining foresight with traditional analysis**: Integrating numbers, hypothetical simulations, and even forecast models to provide concrete data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. Emphasizing budgetary impact is a powerful hook for engaging Parliament members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

### Wales: Legislative Basis for Futures Work

Wales has a unique approach to [[public_sector_and_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]], stemming from the **Well-being of Future Generations Act (2015)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. This legislation:
*   Created national well-being goals and legal duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>.
*   Established an independent Future Generations Commissioner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   Mandated Welsh ministers to publish a Future Trends Report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
*   Defined "long-term" as one of five essential ways of working for sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.

The Future Trends Report curates information through infographics, narrative summaries, and evidence packs, tailored for different audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | Foresight]] is integrated into the organization through logical entry points within existing systems and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>:
*   It's a central part of the impact assessment process for public money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.
*   Included in procurement and grants processes with long-term appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.
*   Part of corporate learning and development for all civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
*   Informs place-specific plans by every Welsh region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.
*   A small dedicated team acts as an advisory hub, empowering colleagues to use [[understanding and utilizing strategic foresight | foresight tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>.

This legislative foundation has led to key government strategies shifting focus to the longer term (2040-2050 horizon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. Wales is also developing a **Wales Futures Hub** to pool resources and bring in diverse perspectives across the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.

### Nesta (UK): Strategic Foresight for Transformative Innovation

Nesta, the UK's [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | Innovation Agency for social good]], uses [[understanding and utilizing strategic foresight | strategic foresight]] to inform [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | transformative innovation]] towards its 2030 missions in education, health, and sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>. Their Discovery team helps colleagues anticipate changes in technology and society beyond 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.

Nesta's methods include:
*   **Horizon scanning**: Identifying emerging technology and social changes to strengthen strategy (e.g., Future Signals series) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.
*   **Stress-testing ideas**: Answering big questions for mission colleagues (e.g., future heating payment models, innovative obesity policies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>.
*   **Developing novel approaches**: Blending traditional foresight techniques with data science, qualitative research, and design (e.g., Innovation Sweet Spots program) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
*   **Speculating and prototyping**: Exploring how future technologies could be used (e.g., generative AI in early years education, future of the UK's gas grid, synthetic biology for climate change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.
*   **Exposing staff to new ideas**: Bringing in external perspectives and practices (e.g., Discovery month on generative AI, expert residencies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.
*   **Creating space for exploration**: Designing programs for experimental and self-directed work (e.g., sabbaticals, Explorations Week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>.

These activities have led to Nesta's colleagues being more confident with uncertainty, bolder in ideas, and more comfortable with failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.

## Challenges and Enabling Factors in Foresight Implementation

### Common Barriers

Interactive exercises with practitioners identified several common [[challenges_and_solutions_in_foresight_implementation | barriers to strategic foresight implementation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:02">[02:06:02]</a>:
*   Time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>
*   Silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>
*   Workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>
*   Budget <a class="yt=" data-t="02:06:53">[02:06:53]</a>
*   Short-term thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:53">[02:06:53]</a>
*   Overwhelm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>
*   Lack of training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:04">[02:07:04]</a>
*   Capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:14">[02:07:14]</a>
*   Lack of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:34">[02:07:34]</a>
*   Buy-in from decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:51">[02:07:51]</a>

### Key Enabling Factors and Lessons

Successful [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | foresight implementation]] requires:
*   **Ecosystem Approach**: Thinking in terms of supply and demand for foresight, nurturing a healthy ecosystem rather than focusing on a single "super team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>. This includes culture, behavior, processes, structures, and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.
*   **Institutionalization**: Moving beyond one-off projects to structural mandates for [[public_sector_and_strategic_foresight | foresight within government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.
*   **Clear Expectations**: Defining clear expectations for foresight activities, outputs, and principles (e.g., future-proof, evidence-based, inclusive, systemic, resilience-focused) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>.
*   **Balanced Internal/External Capacity**: Ensuring sufficient internal capacity for designing and collaborating on initiatives, even when working with external partners like academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:58">[01:14:58]</a>.
*   **Tailoring Products**: Curating foresight products for different audiences, using visuals, graphs, figures, and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.
*   **Framing for Decision-Making**: Presenting [[understanding and utilizing strategic foresight | foresight]] as a tool for better decision-making, not accurate predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.
*   **Logical Entry Points**: Identifying existing systems and processes within organizations where foresight can be integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.
*   **Effective Networks**: Harnessing diverse networks, including academia, other countries, and organizations, to maximize influence and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28">[01:15:28]</a>.
*   **Involvement and Hands-On Approach**: Getting stakeholders involved in using foresight tools, even on hypothetical topics, to demonstrate value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.
*   **Measure Impact**: While difficult, impact can be tracked by how foresight messages spread among policy designers and in public discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>. Setting thresholds or milestones (e.g., a certain number of key persons realizing an issue) can also be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>.
*   **Milestones and Governance**: For long-term strategies, setting sensible intermediate milestones and having regular project boards or groups to discuss progress is crucial to prevent them from becoming mere ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Flexibility is also essential due to accelerating change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

The OECD will be publishing a first set of good principles for anticipatory innovation governance in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:09">[01:24:09]</a>.

The field of public sector innovation is witnessing significant growth and maturity in the application of [[application_of_behavioral_science | behavioral insights]] and gamification, often through their innovative merger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This trend is part of a broader shift towards making "invisible" insights visible to achieve greater effect, frequently utilizing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Overview

### Behavioral Insights
[[application_of_behavioral_science | Behavioral insights]], sometimes referred to as "nudges," are utilized by governments to comprehend human motivations and guide individuals towards desired actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Examples include encouraging timely tax payments or greater contributions to retirement accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The number of government-related [[behavioral insights in innovation | behavioral insights]] units has expanded to over 200 organizations globally in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### Gamification
Gamification in public innovation has evolved beyond traditional "post-it based workshops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. A new emergence involves "serious games" and other advanced gamification methods that move past common workshop fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. An example includes the European Commission's scenario exploration system, which helps users develop future journeys and scenarios through role-playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Dozens of such games are available on the OECD's toolkit navigator platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### The Merger
A significant trend is the combination of [[application_of_behavioral_science | behavioral insights]] and gamification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This integration allows for more sophisticated approaches to public sector challenges.

## Case Study: Carrot Rewards

Carrot Rewards, an initiative from Canada, exemplifies the successful merger of gamification and [[application_of_behavioral_science | behavioral insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. It was recognized with the Edge of Government award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

### Problem
The primary problem addressed was the unsustainable rise in healthcare costs in Canada, alongside a desire to improve the wellness and well-being of Canadian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

### Solution
The Government of Canada partnered with Carrot Insights to develop the Carrot Rewards app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The app allows users to earn points for engaging in healthy behaviors, such as setting and meeting walking goals or completing quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. These points can then be used in loyalty programs, which are highly popular in Canada, with about 90% of Canadians subscribed to at least one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Rewards include flights or gift cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Impact
The Carrot Rewards app has gained significant popularity and has successfully collaborated with various health campaigns. For instance, a partnership with the annual flu campaign involved push notifications and geo-localization quizzes to remind users to get their flu shots and locate the nearest pharmacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. This campaign led to 30,000 people taking the flu shot, contributing to a healthier and safer Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched its latest report, "Logic: Good Practice Principles for Mainstreaming [[Behavioral Public Policy | Behavioral Public Policy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This report provides guidance for setting up and sustaining [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] functions within governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Why "Logic"?

Many governments worldwide seek support from the OECD to establish [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Learning from countries like the UK, which established the first behavioral insights unit in 2010, has provided significant lessons on effectively embedding [[behavioral science in public administration | behavioral science]] into public policies and government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The "Logic" report addresses key questions such as how to set up a [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] function, determine the best governance models, and ensure the impact and sustainability of [[behavioral insights in public administration | behavioral functions]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Defining Behavioral Public Policy

[[Behavioral Public Policy | Behavioral public policy]] is defined as the use of [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] evidence to help inform policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. It assists governments and policymakers in several phases of the policy cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>:
*   **Problem Identification**: Helps identify and prioritize societal challenges where citizen behavior is counter to long-term interests (e.g., unhealthy food choices, low program uptake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. It also aids in understanding the drivers and barriers of specific group behaviors within a social system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Policy Assessment**: Provides tools like randomized control trials (RCTs), pilot testing, and other experimental methods to de-risk policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Policy Implementation**: Traditionally, [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] helps decide how a policy should be implemented, optimize existing programs, maximize their impact, and ensure intended outcomes are realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Assists policymakers in monitoring and evaluating policy implementation to address key issues in subsequent policy cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Growth and Diversity of Behavioral Science in Government

The OECD has identified over 300 institutions worldwide applying [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] to public policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This growth is occurring in two directions:
*   **Broadening**: A wider range of countries are establishing [[behavioral insights in government | behavioral science functions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Deepening**: Many countries now have multiple teams and functions across various public administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Over half of these new teams have been created since 2019, a trend likely accelerated by COVID-19, which was inherently a [[behavioral problem | behavioral problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Governments are adopting diverse governance arrangements, including dedicated units in the center of government, specific functions in line agencies, dispersed expertise, or *ad hoc* external expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Challenges in Institutionalizing Behavioral Science

Despite significant growth, practitioners still face a variety of challenges, primarily related to institutional factors and the relationship between [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] teams and their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Counter-intuitively, older, more mature teams often report more challenges, suggesting they encounter different situations over time and develop strategies to address them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The "Logic" report leverages collective knowledge from both experienced and new teams to identify effective practices for [[Challenges and Best Practices in Institutionalizing Behavioral Science | mainstreaming behavioral public policy]] and overcoming these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## The Logic Principles

The "Logic" framework comprises 14 principles organized into five dimensions:

### 1. Leadership
The actions and words of influential leaders are crucial for encouraging the uptake of [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. When senior leaders advocate for a people-centered approach and robust evidence, the use of [[behavioral insights in government | behavioral science]] increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Principle 1**: Senior leaders request and advocate for [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Principle 2**: Managers maintain senior leader support for [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

### 2. Objectives
Governments can integrate [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] into strategic plans and monitor its use over time, including a formal definition and its relation to strategic government goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Principle 3**: Define strategic objectives for [[behavioral insights in government | behavioral science functions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

*   **Principle 5**: Use [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] to design and improve internal organizational processes, rules, and incentives, making public administration more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

### 3. Governance
A clear accountability structure for managing resources and activities helps efficiently and effectively embed [[behavioral science in public administration | behavioral science]] into policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Principle 6**: Senior leaders clearly allocate responsibility for [[Challenges and Best Practices in Institutionalizing Behavioral Science | mainstreaming behavioral science]] and establish lines of accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Principle 7**: Senior leaders and managers mobilize sufficient resources for policy advice informed by relevant and reliable [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

### 4. Integration
Creating an enabling environment allows [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] evidence to be embedded into processes and be more easily produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Principle 8**: Managers integrate [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] into standard guidelines and procedures for policy development, implementation, and evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Principle 9**: Managers ensure [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] is applied responsibly, openly, and with high integrity standards to build and maintain trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Principle 10**: Create a data infrastructure to support data collection and analysis, making it easier to diagnose behavioral issues and evaluate policy options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

### 5. Capability
This dimension focuses on the ability of public administration to produce and utilize [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   **Principle 11**: Managers build policymakers' capability to apply [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] to their work, fostering broad literacy in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Principle 12**: Develop sustainable ways for policymakers to access more advanced [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] expertise when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   **Principle 13**: Managers ensure [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] evidence is useful to inform policymaking processes through quality brokerage, positioning experts as advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
*   **Principle 14**: Managers build mechanisms for dissemination and knowledge sharing, such as networks of [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] experts and supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Country Experiences and Lessons Learned

Experts from Finland, the UK, and Brazil shared their experiences in embedding [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] into their governments.

### Finland
Merit Lender, lead senior specialist in the Finnish behavioral policy team, highlighted several turning points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
*   **Early Initiatives**: The journey began in 2013 with government collaboration on "governments for future" and a four-year government-led "experimentation culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. The Finnish basic income experiment in 2017 garnered significant media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
*   **COVID-19 Pilot**: In 2020, during the COVID-19 crisis, Finland benchmarked other countries' [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] uses and started a six-month pilot, which particularly helped the communications team with messaging around masks and vaccinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
*   **Team Growth**: A key turning point was the growth of the team in the Prime Minister's office to two people by late 2021, leading to increased interest and a growing network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. Successful RCTs, such as encouraging youth voting via text messages, were widely reported and helped scale the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The team has since grown to four, soon to be five, people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
*   **Enabling Factors**: Success was attributed to a strong team, good support from the Prime Minister's Office, the perception that governments "can't afford not to use [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]]" for impact, and an approach that is ambitious yet humble, focusing on working together with civil servants rather than just advising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.
*   **Lessons Learned**: Implementing [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] takes significant time and resources with no shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. Understanding the local context and systems by working from the inside is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. The role of communications is vital for building trust and letting people know who you are and what you do, through regular events and popularized research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. Collaboration and involving civil servants in the process is transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>.

### United Kingdom
Rupert Gill, who built the [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] team at Ofcom (the UK media regulator), and previously led the largest in-house [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] team in the UK government at HMRC, shared insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   **Early Success**: The UK's first behavioral insights unit's trial at HMRC (tax compliance messaging) was a significant early point, showing quantifiable impact with strong political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Adapting to Change**: When political support wanes, teams must adapt. Instead of always aiming for the "mainstream," finding "sidestreams" or siloed areas with more autonomy can provide a louder voice and better opportunities for impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. At HMRC, success was found in debt management, building relationships, training junior staff, and running multi-year trial series on complex behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.
*   **Pandemic Response (Furlough Scheme)**: The COVID-19 furlough scheme saw thorough [[behavioral insights in government | behavioral thinking]] applied, influencing framing, human-centered service design, guidance writing, user interface, and anti-fraud measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.
*   **Factors for Success**:
    *   **Novelty**: New schemes without established norms open doors for new ideas and less resistance to the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.
    *   **Track Record**: A proven track record and established credibility build trust and relationships, allowing teams to be at the "top table" during critical discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.
    *   **Senior Buy-in**: Strong support from senior figures who understand [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]]'s value, like Rishi Sunak during the furlough scheme, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.
    *   **Proactivity**: Behavioral teams must be opportunistic, knowing the organization well, and having strong communicators to identify and capitalize on opportunities and clearly convey value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.
*   **Lessons Learned**: Continual advocacy is needed because people don't fully understand [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]]'s benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. Maintaining subtlety in interventions is challenging within large government organizations designed for standardization; careful design can be lost during scaling unless constant advocacy is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

### Brazil
Marara Camoes, coordinator of Cinco, the [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] unit in Brazil's Ministry of Management and Innovation in Public Services, discussed Brazil's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
*   **Early Stages**: Brazil's journey began with isolated experiences, followed by initiatives in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. At the federal level, the National School of Public Administration started regular [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] courses in 2017, and a method called "simplement" was developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>. This created awareness and critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.
*   **Turning Point (Cinco)**: The key turning point was the establishment of Cinco in 2023, the first [[behavioral science in government | behavioral science]] unit in a new ministry focused on management and innovation and public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. This provided possibilities because the ministry is responsible for transversal policies across the entire public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
*   **Success Factors**:
    *   **Innovation Movement**: A strong innovation movement within Brazil and the advocacy of individuals like Camoes were crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.
    *   **Civil Servant Engagement**: The desire among civil servants to solve public problems and help society fueled engagement, with many wanting to join the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.
    *   **Diverse Team**: Cinco was able to recruit civil servants from various public organizations (federal universities, regulatory agencies), creating a diverse team of 15 full-time and one part-time member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.
    *   **Co-creation**: A focus on developing projects *with* policymakers, not just *for* them, helps build a sense of belonging and ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solving Application**: [[Behavioral insights in government | Behavioral insights]] are applied to long-standing, complex problems like mosquito-transmitted diseases, where traditional campaigns have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.
*   **Lessons Learned**: Learning from more experienced teams is vital, especially regarding non-technical and political issues encountered in running projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>. Building bridges and working together with diverse experts, even without a large budget, is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

## Future Application of Logic

The OECD plans to use the "Logic" principles to conduct country reviews on how governments organize and manage their use of [[role_of_behavioral_science_in_government_policy | behavioral science to improve policies]], services, and internal administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. These reviews will help countries understand how they compare to global benchmarks of best practices, providing practical advice for setting up new [[behavioral insights in government | behavioral science functions]], transforming existing ones, or further refining established practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.

This article explores how governments and organizations can become more [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory]] and transformative, drawing lessons from the COVID-19 crisis. The discussion highlights the need to anticipate, experiment, and explore systemic solutions to current and upcoming challenges, emphasizing the importance of keeping the momentum for innovation and transformation beyond crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Imperative for Anticipation

The COVID-19 crisis opened a "window of opportunity" for policy options previously unavailable, creating a chance to explore and implement new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. A recurring theme from global discussions is that governments must [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipate]], experiment, and explore systemic solutions to challenges they face today and in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Despite scientists warning about the possibility of a pandemic, COVID-19 still took the world by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. This reveals a striking combination of foreseen risks and actual surprise, underscoring the need to better integrate scientific insights into policy and adjust science systems to be better prepared for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

### Challenges in Using Foresight

A key question arises: if foresight exercises anticipated the Coronavirus pandemic, why did existing plans not work as effectively? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a> Several reasons contribute to this:
*   **Mindset:** A tendency to extrapolate the past and assume small changes, rather than embracing "deep uncertainty" where the future may be radically different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.
*   **Role of Science:** The role of science in society is often too low, with challenges in how scientists communicate and how the public and policymakers perceive scientific input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>. A true partnership between science and other societal spheres is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.
*   **Public Pressure:** A possible failure of public pressure around crisis management, as probabilistic dangers that are not immediate may not be considered "sexy" topics for politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.
*   **Market Incentives:** Areas like vaccine development may not be profitable for industry, creating a major problem when a market for such interventions is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>.
*   **Impact Gap:** There is a significant "impact gap" in future thinking, where the future is perceived as distant, leading to delayed action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.

## Methods and Approaches for [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]]

To navigate complexity and uncertainty, several methods and approaches are highlighted:

### Agile and Adaptive Working Methods
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), an independent body of the EU, was set up to enhance Europe's competitiveness, tackle global challenges, and change Europe's innovation culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. When the crisis hit, EIT was prepared, having planned for impact-driven projects, distributing work through small entities, maximizing interdisciplinary interaction, and allowing for bottom-up control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. They deployed agile and adaptive working methods, mission approaches, and quickly set up a crisis response initiative, channeling â‚¬60 million to 207 new innovation projects and ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This approach allowed them to respond swiftly and leverage a broad ecosystem of over 2,000 partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>.

### Goal-Based Regulation and Digitalization
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) recognized that society was too "old fashioned" in its digitalization efforts during the crisis, leading to discussions about establishing a digital agency and a digital architecture design center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. Their "governance innovation" approach advocates for goal-based regulations over rule-based ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. This allows for more innovative methods to achieve regulatory goals, with multi-stakeholders creating guidelines and standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Real-time monitoring, primarily conducted by businesses, is key to assessing whether goals are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This approach incentivizes businesses to cooperate with investigations by offering mechanisms like deferred prosecution agreements, fostering information disclosure and continuous learning for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.

### Participatory Technology Assessment and Upstream Governance
[[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] involves going "upstream" in technology development to include participatory elements, moving beyond a purely market-driven influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. This means engaging stakeholders in the development of technology and governance approaches simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. An example is the Toronto Waterfront project, which partnered with Sidewalk Labs to create a technology-enabled urban environment, allowing the co-development of autonomous vehicles and regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.

### Robust Portfolios and System Archetypes
Given deep uncertainty, it's crucial to think in terms of "robust portfolios of options" or "robust solutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>. This involves identifying actions that work across different future scenarios by investigating co-benefits or multiple dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. Understanding system archetypes (e.g., "fixes that fail," "limits to growth") can help policymakers identify leverage points in complex adaptive systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_strategies_for_implementing_anticipatory_innovation | Challenges and Strategies for Implementing Anticipatory Innovation]]

### Overcoming Bureaucratic Inertia
Traditional government structures, with their budget and political cycles, often make it difficult to adapt to rapid changes and implement long-term foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>. Even the presence of individuals in policy positions can be short-lived, disrupting long-term engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. Strategies to overcome this include:
*   **Beneficial Exercises:** Making foresight exercises beneficial for participants, fostering social learning, and incorporating gamified approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.
*   **Mission-Driven Approaches:** Establishing clear, visible, long-term goals that many people can support, along with a step-by-step approach to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>. Missions also foster coordination among different agencies, facilitating innovation across governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.
*   **Flexible Funding & Monitoring:** Moving towards multi-annual grants and adapting monitoring methods to focus on long-term impact rather than just short-term deliverables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.
*   **Accepting Uncertainty in Measurement:** Recognizing that clear attribution or contribution to systemic change is often not possible with 100% certainty, and embracing flexibility in understanding uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.

### Science-Policy Interface
A crucial aspect is bridging the gap between scientific knowledge and policy action. This requires:
*   **Transdisciplinary Research:** Moving beyond interdisciplinary research to cross boundaries between science and other social and political spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
*   **Public-Private Sector Linkage:** Enhancing collaboration between academic and private sector research, recognizing the vast potential solutions and knowledge held by the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
*   **Agility and Dissemination:** Accelerating the dissemination of scientific knowledge to policy circles and the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.
*   **Supporting Institutions:** Maintaining stable and robust institutions that deal with risk, such as research and science advisory bodies, and avoiding defunding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **International Cooperation:** Leveraging global scientific networks and international cooperation, especially for developing countries to access knowledge and build capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

## Future Commitments for [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]]

Participants committed to personal and organizational changes based on lessons from the crisis:
*   **Government Role:** Admitting that it's impossible for governments to plan and order everything by themselves, and instead focusing on goal-based, multi-stakeholder, cross-disciplinary, and cross-border experimental approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.
*   **Generalizable Knowledge:** Ensuring that new scientific projects not only fulfill their specific goals but also create knowledge that is generalizable for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>.
*   **Studying New Models:** Analyzing the diverse models of collaboration and cooperation triggered by the crisis to identify what works in different contexts (e.g., vaccine development, antimicrobial resistance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.
*   **Personal Preparedness:** Committing to being "better safe than sorry," investing in future preparedness for the organization, oneself, and family to be "fit for fight with uncertainty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a>.
*   **Documentation and Feedback:** Writing more about projects and initiatives to provide real-time feedback and lessons learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

By adopting these approaches, it is hoped that societies and organizations will be better prepared for future crises and able to [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipate]] and potentially avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:35">[01:14:35]</a>.

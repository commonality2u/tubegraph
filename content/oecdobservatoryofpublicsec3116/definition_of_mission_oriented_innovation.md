[[missionoriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is a type of innovation where there is a clear purpose for its necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It aims to solve a defined challenge or societal problem that calls for innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Fundamentally, [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] is about [[purpose_driven_innovation | purpose-driven innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, establishing clear goals for why innovation is being pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Key Characteristics
*   **Clear Purpose**: Innovation is driven by a specific, defined objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solving**: It addresses a set challenge or problem in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Goal-Oriented**: There is a clear end goal, determining success or failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Systemic Alignment**: The entire system is aligned to fulfill the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Emergent Ideas**: While having a clear end goal, it can lead to many new ideas that emerge connected to that goal, which may be beneficial in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Example: The Moonshot Mission
One of the most widely recognized examples of [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] is the [[moon_landing_as_an_example_of_mission_oriented_innovation | moonshot mission]] to go to the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Clear Goal**: The objective was unambiguous â€“ either humanity reached the Moon or it did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The ultimate goal was to successfully land on the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **System Alignment**: Organizations like NASA configured their entire system to achieve this specific mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Innovation Outcomes**: This mission directly spurred significant innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Furthermore, numerous other innovations emerged as a side effect of this [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

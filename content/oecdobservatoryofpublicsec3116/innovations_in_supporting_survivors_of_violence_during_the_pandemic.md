The COVID-19 pandemic significantly exacerbated the global crisis of gender-based violence (GBV), often referred to as a "shadow pandemic" by UN Women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Even before the pandemic, it was estimated that over one-third of women experienced some form of violence in their lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>. Lockdowns and confinement during COVID-19 increased the risk of violence, trapping many women and girls with their abusers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

The OECD organized an event on "Government Aftershock" to foster global dialogue on the implications of the current crisis for governments and to identify ways to shape the future of governance based on lessons learned from the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. This includes exploring how governments can strengthen their approaches to addressing GBV, a topic of profound importance for the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Exacerbation of GBV During Crisis

Even before the pandemic, governments struggled with their approach to domestic and gender-based violence, facing a lack of resources and efficient methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. The pandemic intensified these challenges by increasing pressure on families due to factors like job loss and financial insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. Initial government responses often overlooked victims and families, focusing primarily on lockdowns and economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. There was a critical need to reassure victims that services remained a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.

A key concern was that victims believed support services were closed or that their cases were no longer a priority due to health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>. Furthermore, some countries experienced not only an increase in the number of incidents but also a rise in the severity of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>.

## Key Innovations and Responses

Governments and organizations adopted innovative strategies to respond to the escalating GBV crisis.

### 1. Whole-of-Government and Whole-of-Society Approaches

The pandemic underscored the necessity of a [[coordinating_multiagency_responses_to_genderbased_violence | whole-of-government approach]] and a [[coordinating_multiagency_responses_to_genderbased_violence | whole-of-society approach]] to GBV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>. This involves:

*   **Inter-agency Coordination:** Ensuring coordination between different services like police, women's shelters, and counseling centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:00]</a>.
*   **Multi-level Collaboration:** Collaboration across national, regional, and local authorities is crucial in federal states to ensure consistent service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>.
*   **Public and Private Sector Engagement:** Engaging unexpected partners like grocery organizations, pharmacies, garden centers, banks, and business associations to disseminate information and become active in prevention and detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:28:00">[51:28:00]</a>.
*   **Involving Civil Society:** Collaborating with civil society representatives and research institutions to bring light to the "shadow pandemic" and ensure victims are not forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:52:00">[50:52:00]</a>.

### 2. Leveraging Technology and New Communication Channels

To overcome lockdown barriers and reach survivors, governments implemented new technological solutions:

*   **Digital Helplines:** Introducing WhatsApp lines, online websites, and SMS messaging capabilities for hotlines to provide secure and private communication channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:21:00">[48:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.
*   **Online Platforms for Justice:** Developing digital platforms for filing GBV complaints and extending protection measures, as well as providing online guides for victims navigating legal procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>.
*   **Virtual Consultations:** Adapting existing multi-disciplinary approaches to enable online consultations, especially in urgent situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:07:00">[36:07:00]</a>.
*   **Creative Solutions for Outreach:** Implementing "sidewalk conversations" or meetings at special public places for professionals to engage with survivors when home visits were difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>.

### 3. Strengthening Services and Coordination

Governments focused on ensuring the continuity and accessibility of essential services:

*   **Essential Service Declaration:** Declaring GBV-related services as essential to ensure they remained operational during lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:41:00">[47:41:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Resources:** Providing additional financial support to helplines to manage increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>, increasing resources and additional shifts for hotlines, and expanding shelter capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:02:00">[47:02:00]</a>.
*   **Protection Measures:** Automatically extending restraining orders and other protection measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:47:00">[47:47:00]</a>.
*   **Exemption from Curfew:** Publicly communicating that victims seeking help for GBV would not face sanctions for violating curfew or quarantine restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:56:00">[47:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.
*   **Integrated Models:** Adopting and adapting integrated models like the Family Justice Center model, which brings professionals from various organizations under one roof to provide comprehensive support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:24:00">[34:24:24]</a>. This model has shown to increase reporting where it exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:20:00">[37:20:00]</a>.

### 4. Importance of Data and Evaluation

A key lesson from the pandemic is the critical need for better data collection and evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:31:00">[32:31:00]</a>. This enables governments to:

*   **Monitor the Situation:** Establish short-term information flows to collect weekly data from various actors (police, victim support services, shelters) across all regions, including urban and rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:27:00">[27:27:00]</a>.
*   **Identify Trends:** Understand if there's a general increase in cases or if reported increases are due to improved awareness or reporting mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Based Policy:** Develop robust, evidence-based policy responses by identifying where to focus efforts, which groups to target, and what measures are most effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.

### 5. Survivor-Centered Design

Innovations emphasized placing survivors at the core of response efforts:

*   **Listening to Survivors:** Regularly engaging with survivors through focus groups to understand their needs and experiences with existing services, and incorporating their input into policy and service design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensuring services are accessible to all, regardless of age, disability, or migration status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. This includes providing information in multiple languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.
*   **Challenging Bias:** Working with first responders (police, prosecutors, judiciary) to challenge preconceived ideas and unconscious biases about gender through behavioral insights, thereby improving service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>.
*   **Promoting Hope:** Offering survivors hope and a perspective for a better future, emphasizing that they have the power to overcome their situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Engaging Men and Boys:** Developing platforms with online courses on positive masculinity to encourage men and boys to prevent violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

## Country-Specific Examples

### Switzerland
Switzerland quickly established a National Task Force on GBV and COVID-19 in March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>. Chaired by the Federal Office for Gender Equality, its goals included ensuring the continued operation of counseling centers and shelters and police availability for domestic violence cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>. Challenges included coordinating across its federal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>. The task force implemented regular monitoring, a poster campaign in 13 languages to inform the public that domestic violence remains a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:00">[28:36:00]</a>, and provided financial support to helplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>. Switzerland did not observe a general increase in reported domestic violence cases by the police, but rather an increase in phone calls to centers for various issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>. This highlights the need for better data and caution in interpreting results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>.

### Belgium (Family Justice Centers)
The Family Justice Center model, originating in the US, proved highly effective. In Antwerp, a Family Justice Center managed to quickly switch to a central and virtual coordination role for domestic violence and child abuse situations during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:15:00">[35:15:00]</a>. Their existing multi-disciplinary approach facilitated this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:03:00">[36:03:00]</a>. The Belgian government supported this by securing additional housing in hotels for survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a>. A survey in Belgium showed an increase in reports in areas with Family Justice Centers, contrasting with decreases in areas without them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>. Lessons included sharing experiences internationally and creating practical guidelines for professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:00]</a>.

### Chile
Chile was among the few countries to adopt a specific contingency plan for GBV in March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a>. The plan focused on securing service continuity, strengthening response capacity for hotlines (which saw a 250% increase in calls) and shelters, and activating a GBV coordination circuit across government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:30:00">[46:30:00]</a>. [[Innovative responses to Covid19 by governments | Innovations]] included silent helplines (WhatsApp, online), an alliance with pharmacies for information dissemination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:21:00">[48:21:00]</a>, and including helpline information in daily COVID-19 sanitary reports on national TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:35:00">[49:35:00]</a>. Chile also created a Council of Women on COVID-19 involving congresswomen and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:52:00">[50:52:00]</a>, partnered with the state bank to distribute information, and engaged the private sector in prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:28:00">[51:28:00]</a>. Future initiatives include identifying system bottlenecks with the World Bank to develop a single registry for survivor data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>, using behavioral insights with first responders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:56">[01:08:56]</a>, and engaging men and boys through positive masculinity courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

## Future Directions and Lessons Learned

The pandemic highlighted the need for governments to plan more strategically and act more proactively on GBV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Key takeaways for future [[Government innovation during COVID19 | government innovation]] and [[Innovation strategies during COVID19 recovery | recovery strategies]] include:

*   **Permanent Coordination:** Transforming temporary task forces into permanent coordination mechanisms that can be quickly scaled up during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.
*   **Mainstreaming GBV:** Ensuring that the gender and domestic violence perspectives are integrated into all government task forces, including health and economic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>.

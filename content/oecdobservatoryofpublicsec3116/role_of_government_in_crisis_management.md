Governments historically structured for predictable environments face significant challenges when confronted with crises like the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This global crisis has revealed that stability is often "fictional" and the future is highly uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. In such times, governments cannot afford to stand still, as the cost of late action or inaction can be severely high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Embracing Uncertainty

A key shift required is for [[government_role_in_managing_uncertainty_and_complexity | governments to embrace uncertainty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This involves moving beyond a traditional "control" worldview, which assumes definitive answers and rigid planning, to one where learning and adaptation are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Key Aspects of Crisis Management

### Systemic Challenges and Transformation
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted that contemporary challenges are global, complex, and deeply [[systems_thinking_in_government_during_crises | systemic in nature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This necessitates using crisis-driven investments to transform entire systems, including production, mobility, energy, food, education, and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Such transformations cut across various policy areas and demand strong leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Proactive vs. Reactive Approach
Governments need to prioritize "prepare rather than react" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This includes:
*   **Scenario Planning** Utilizing tools to explore various future possibilities without being prescriptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Finland, for example, has a long tradition of future work integrated into government and parliamentary discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **Whole-of-Government Approach** Requiring leadership to shift culture, behavior, and work practices to ensure cross-agency coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

### Innovation and Experimentation
The capacity for [[impact_of_crisis_management_on_innovation | innovation]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Governments should:
*   Invest in the future by shaping markets and creating opportunities for transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Allow for risk-managed experimentation, fostering a culture of learning where even negative results are valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. This can involve regulatory sandboxes to test new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   Invest in research, innovation, and crucial infrastructure, particularly digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Interdependence and Collaboration
Crises highlight both biological and moral interdependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. [[International and local collaboration in crisis management | No country or entity can respond alone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. This necessitates:
*   **Whole-of-Nation Coordination** Governments must act as facilitators, bringing together multiple sectors, private actors, and community groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Stewardship** The role of the state expands beyond regulator or order provider to ecosystem steward, convening different parties and aggregating interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Quality Relationships and Trust** Building trust between different actors (government, public, private, and [[the_role_of_civil_society_in_crisis_management | civil society]]) is vital for effective learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. Trust involves credibility, reliability, and intimacy (understanding each other's viewpoints) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

### Shifting Paradigms within Government
To effectively lead, governments need to adopt new ways of operating:
*   **From Performance to Capacity Management** Shifting focus from rigid performance metrics to building the learning capacity of organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. Hierarchies, often associated with performance management, can hinder learning due to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
*   **Mindset Shifts**
    *   From optimization to resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
    *   From purely quantitative to qualitative indicators of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
    *   From outputs to outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
    *   From linear to exponential thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
    *   From scarcity/fixed mindsets to abundance/growth mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
    *   From stable equilibrium focus to iterative work with continuous adjustment and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
    *   From siloed thinking to integration, accepting local sub-optimization for global benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Leadership Qualities** Leaders must balance different tensions: present and future, micro and macro, short-term and long-term, and knowing when to slow down or speed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>. This "polarity-based thinking" allows leaders to toggle between seemingly competing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

### Citizen Engagement and Trust
To build trust and legitimacy, governments should involve citizens in the creation of principles, norms, and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. This means fostering participatory governance where problems are deliberated collectively to find synergistic solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>. It's about enabling citizens to experience how things can be done differently, fostering internal motivation for behavioral change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. Special attention should be given to including the voices of the most vulnerable people, who are often most impacted by challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.

The [[government_response_to_the_covid19_crisis | COVID-19 crisis]] has demonstrated that public-private partnerships, often seen in cities, are crucial for co-creation of priorities, visions, and prototypes that deliver tangible results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. This local-level collaboration needs to be connected through national and international efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

## [[Role of Government after COVID19 | Post-COVID-19 Role of Government]]
The pandemic reminds us that the "normal" is a myth, and we are entering a "never normal" situation of continuous flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Therefore, the role of government is not to find a fixed end point but to continuously adjust, learn, and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. This involves making wise investments, embracing an [[the_role_of_public_sector_innovation in_crisis_response | entrepreneurial state]] mindset, and constantly questioning assumptions to prepare for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

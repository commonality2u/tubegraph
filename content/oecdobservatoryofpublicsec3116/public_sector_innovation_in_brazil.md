This article provides an overview of two recent OECD reports focusing on [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] in Brazil. The reports emphasize the need for a more deliberate and systemic approach to innovation within the Brazilian public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Background and Context

The collaboration between the National School for Public Administration (Enap) and the OECD began in 2015 with a Memorandum of Understanding specifically focused on [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This partnership led to three reviews:
*   **Digital Government Review (2016):** This brought new visions and approaches to Brazilian e-government processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Innovation Skills and Leadership in Brazilian Public Sector Review:** Focused on updating capacity building for 21st-century skills and understanding needs for senior executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Innovation System of the Public Service of Brazil Review:** Explored how to better promote an ecosystem for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Brazil has a history of engaging with [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]], including the establishment of the "InovaGov" network in 2015, which connects over 100 public and private organizations, academia, and other stakeholders interested in the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The country has also had [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] awards for public sectors since 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Despite these efforts, there was recognized room for improvement in understanding the context, challenges, and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

The two recent reports were launched at the fifth edition of Brazil's [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] Week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. They were started under one administration and concluded under another, highlighting the importance of external vision from the OECD in maintaining continuity for both agendas through political transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Report 1: The Public Sector Innovation System in Brazil

This report addresses the question of how Brazil can adopt a more deliberate and systemic approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Key Messages

*   Brazil needs [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] to achieve its ambitions and solve real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   While [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] has occurred, a deliberate and systemic approach is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   A systemic approach involves considering the extent and mix of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] occurring and whether there's stewardship of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Why this Report?

[[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] is increasingly becoming a core repertoire of effective government, no longer just a sporadic or reactive activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Complex challenges faced by governments today necessitate routine and ongoing innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Despite great examples in Brazil, innovation has not yet been systemic, and treating it as a side effort is no longer viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Brazil has many drivers for a more considered approach to innovation, including issues of inequality, the financial position of the government, fighting corruption, and changing demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]], while not a magic bullet, is a necessary component to address these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Innovation Journey in Brazil

Looking at the history of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] in Brazil reveals certain patterns:
*   **Long-standing emphasis on de-bureaucratization:** Aiming for efficiency and streamlined processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **1990s focus:** New Public Management reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Subsequent periods:** Modernization, e-government, and, in the last decade, [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | digital transformation]] with a specific focus on innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

These historical rhythms show a legalistic system with a strong emphasis on controls and fighting corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. While there's a strong focus on the citizen and impressive [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | digital transformation]] efforts, innovation hasn't yet been fully integrated into the public service narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Directives and laws, while necessary, are not sufficient to embed innovation practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The system needs to balance its structural emphasis on processes with a focus on innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

### Challenges to Innovation

The public sector, as an institution, inherently faces challenges in fostering innovation:
*   **Risk Aversion:** Public sectors are designed to avoid negative feedback; mistakes are remembered, and political processes focus on what goes wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. This contrasts with the private sector, which can tolerate more pain for potential profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Complexity of Innovation:** Innovation is inherently difficult and involves an ongoing process of learning, making it something that can never be fully mastered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

### A Deliberate and Systemic Approach

To overcome these challenges, a deliberate and systemic approach to [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This means moving beyond innovation driven by exceptional individual efforts, crises, or political commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

A systemic approach involves three key questions:
1.  Is innovation occurring to the extent needed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>
2.  Is the innovation occurring likely to provide the right mix of options? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>
3.  Is there some form of stewardship to ensure the innovation system delivers as hoped? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>

### Models for Understanding Innovation

The report uses two models to illustrate its thinking:

#### 1. Determinants Model

This model looks at the underlying factors that determine the extent of innovation:
*   **Individual-driven innovation:** Often seen in Brazil, but vulnerable to individuals leaving, burning out, or getting tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. It's not sustainable or systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Organization-driven innovation:** Solves specific organizational problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
*   **Systemic-driven innovation:** Integrates collective interests into the innovation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
The goal is to move innovation from individual and organizational levels up to the systemic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

#### 2. Innovation Facets Model ([[types_of_public_sector_innovation | Portfolio Mix of Innovation]])

This model categorizes different types of innovation activity:
*   **Enhancement-oriented:** Building on existing approaches, adding new things but doubling down on current methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented:** Dealing with big, audacious goals (e.g., putting a man on the moon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
*   **Adaptive:** Bottom-up responses to changes on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
*   **Anticipating:** Asking big questions about what should be done given the changing future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
In Brazil's risk-averse environment, innovation often defaults to enhancement-oriented approaches, raising the question of whether this mix is deliberate or unintentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

#### 3. System Stewardship

This concept refers to collective consideration of the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Since innovation is context-specific, it can pull the system in different directions, especially in a large and complex system like Brazil with thousands of local government situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Stewardship is needed to ensure overall coherence and interoperability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

### Findings in the Brazilian Context

The report found that in Brazil:
*   Much innovation was driven by individuals or organizational perspectives rather than systemic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.
*   There was a lack of emphasis on underlying determinants shaping systemic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   The current structure pushed innovation towards more incremental and uncontroversial forms, despite a need for radical exploration and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
*   Existing stewardship was implicit or accidental, rather than explicitly recognized or official <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

### Future Scenarios for Innovation

The report explores different future scenarios to test assumptions and illustrate potential paths, without advocating for a specific one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. These scenarios help in thinking about how existing measures might play out over time and what would be required to change things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>:
1.  **Current trajectory:** What if the system continues as is? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>
2.  **Building upon existing efforts:** What if current initiatives are taken further? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>
3.  **Innovation at the center:** What if innovation truly became central with significant emphasis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>

### Achievements and Opportunities

The report acknowledges several achievements in Brazilian [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]]:
*   **Innovation Awards:** Provide rich insights, highlight value, and inspire others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.
*   **Establishment of InovaGov and Innovation Week:** Excellent mechanisms for socializing innovation, connecting people, and building momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   **Collaboration among major actors:** Including joint sponsorship of the report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.
*   **Growth of innovation labs:** Highlighting new approaches and thinking in various contexts, contributing to maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.
*   [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | Digital transformation]] agenda: Highlighted the value of change and provided a model for broader system-level transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

The report offers key areas of opportunity, divided for different audiences:

#### For the Whole System
*   Establish an explicit agenda for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]], clarifying what is wanted, when it is needed, and how it will be supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.
*   Give more attention to structural drivers, offsetting inherent inertia and biases against innovation (e.g., auditors focusing on risks of *not* innovating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
*   Establish explicit responsibility for stewardship of the [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

#### For Central Actors
*   Major agencies should have an explicit role in the system's functioning. For instance, clarifying Enap's relationship with the Ministry of Economy and control bodies like TCU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>.
*   Ministry of Economy should make clear links between [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] and [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | digital transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
*   Control bodies should identify how audit and risk management can support innovation, rather than being seen as barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.
*   Enap, on behalf of the InovaGov Network, could partner to develop an annual high-level commentary on system performance to be shared at Innovation Week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

#### For Individual Agencies
*   Identify and publicize innovation priorities within their operations to help internal and external contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

## Report 2: Skills and Leadership for Innovation

This report focuses on the skills and leadership needed to drive [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

### Why this Report?

A 2010 OECD report found Brazil's civil service system to be rigid, fragmented by careers, and lacking leadership and vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. The concept of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] serves as a rallying call for rethinking how civil services are organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. Senior civil servants (DAS five and six positions, or FCPE equivalents) are pivotal in enabling change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.

Focusing on senior civil servants addresses several challenges:
*   **Productivity and Efficiency:** Brazil has an expensive civil service, with remuneration costs at 13% of GDP (OECD average is 10%) and almost 30% of public expenditure (OECD average is 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. Effective management and leadership are crucial to maximize this investment in people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.
*   **Public Trust:** Low public trust in government in Brazil (and across the OECD) is linked to perceptions of integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>. A highly qualified, professional senior civil service is a key indicator of less corruption and greater public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.
*   **Support for Innovation:** Leadership support is one of the most critical factors for successful [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], and its absence is a major barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.

The study aimed to identify skills and competencies needed by senior civil servants to support [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] and become stewards of the system, imply policies and programs, and provide specific recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.

### Public Leadership for Innovation

Public leadership for [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is highly contextualized and requires leaders to understand their specific situation and apply the right tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. Leadership is about producing desired outcomes through the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

The report identifies six core skills areas for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] at an organizational view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. A survey of nearly 3,000 Brazilian civil servants on these skills revealed:
*   **Self-assessment:** A middle-level assessment of their own skills, with strong curiosity but less confidence in areas like iteration or user-centricity <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. Specific gaps were identified in prototyping and using behavioral insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.
*   **Managerial support:** Significantly lower perceptions of managers' ability to support them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.
*   **Organizational readiness:** Perceptions fell somewhere in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.

Workshops with Brazilian public sector innovators identified three main skill groups for leaders, built on a foundation of public service values and ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>:
1.  **Business skills:** Ability to align resources with needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.
2.  **Innovation skills:** Leaders don't need to be experts in data science or iterative processes, but must understand how these processes are supported and led <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
3.  **Mindsets:** Empathy, empowering civil servants/citizens, continuous learning, courage, and digital understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. Courage was a frequently mentioned trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.

### Senior Civil Service System Model

The report developed a new model for understanding a senior civil service system, viewing it from both a **supply** and **demand** side perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>. Most OECD countries have structured processes for leadership development, selection, and reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.

*   **Supply Side (Building Leaders):**
    *   Clearly define required skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>.
    *   Provide opportunities to develop skills for current and future leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
    *   Map the workforce to identify existing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.
    *   Create a learning culture for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.

*   **Demand Side (Calling for Leaders):**
    *   Appoint people based on desired criteria, using transparent vetting processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>.
    *   Provide support through training and performance/accountability mechanisms once leaders are in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

### Findings on Supply and Demand in Brazil

In Brazil, there is significant effort on the **supply side** for leadership development and innovation training in various pockets, often led by Enap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. However, very little is being done on the **demand side** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. This is partly due to Brazil's political system, where appointment processes are often at the will of the president and ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>. Building demand requires political buy-in and politicians relinquishing some power and autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

### Recommendations

The report provides recommendations in three stages: immediate, second-stage, and longer-term, acknowledging that iteration and learning are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.

#### Building the Supply (Immediate to Longer-Term)
*   **Unify efforts:** Develop a hub (like Enap is doing) to network and map different initiatives across federal, sub-national, and civil society levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.
*   **Shared vision:** Use this network to develop a more unified innovative leadership competency model, collaboratively defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.
*   **Align training:** Create greater transparency about available training and align existing training offers with the new competency model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

#### Building the Demand (Immediate to Longer-Term)
*   **Merit-based hiring:** Develop and scale merit-based hiring practices that assess innovation competencies for senior positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
    *   A recent presidential decree establishing minimum criteria for DAS and FCPE positions is a great starting point, but much more is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.
    *   Study existing merit-based practices within the federal administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.
    *   Pilot new hiring and recruitment approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.
    *   Longer-term, embed these practices in legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>.
*   **Innovation-oriented objectives in job profiles:** Integrate innovation into job descriptions and performance assessments for senior civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.
    *   This is challenging as innovation is not easily measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.
    *   It is crucial to provide a clear role and protection for civil servants undertaking innovation, as many have faced legal troubles for crossing "gray areas" despite good intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>.
    *   Such integration would offer performance incentives and "cover" for taking risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>.

## Discussion and Future Outlook

The reports provide an adequate vision of the context and challenges, along with good suggestions for the path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.

### Role of Public Universities

Public universities play a crucial role in the [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. They can:
*   Provide insight into identifying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.
*   Generate and source new ideas (new technology, policies, practices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>.
*   Offer rigor in studying implementations and understanding outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>.
*   **Create the talent pipeline:** Most civil servants are university graduates. Stronger linkages between governments and universities are needed to attract graduates and clarify opportunities in public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. Universities should teach relevant skills and present the public sector as a valuable career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

There is often a focus on "policy innovation" (doing things differently in government) rather than "innovation policies" (creating new knowledge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. Enap, as a school with research and innovation departments, actively engages with universities and research centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>. An upcoming pilot aims to bring universities on board to pilot public policies, streamlining testing and appraisal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.

### Role of Open Innovation

Open innovation can be a valuable tool, recognizing that solutions may come from outside government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. It is particularly effective when broad aims are clear, allowing external solutions to be brought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>. However, it may be less suited for exploratory or adaptive innovation where questions are less defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

Brazil is experimenting with open innovation through platforms like "Desafios" (Challenges), where public sector organizations can suggest challenges and offer awards for best solutions or prototypes, including additional funding for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>. This promotes engagement with startups, companies, and society in solving public problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>.

Overall, the reports aim to create a solid community around [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] and maintain ongoing conversation and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>. The findings provide a strong foundation for Brazil's next steps in capacity building and developing its public sector ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>.

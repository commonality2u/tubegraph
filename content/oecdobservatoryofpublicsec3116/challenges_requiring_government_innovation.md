Governments innovate for various reasons, sometimes with a clear objective and other times through more explorative methods. Both approaches are beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Addressing Known Challenges

One primary driver for government innovation is to solve specific, well-defined [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples include:
*   Cleaning up oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   Solving homelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

In these cases, innovation is directly aimed at achieving a specific target, providing clear direction for activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The problem itself legitimizes the need for innovation within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Fostering Exploration and Creativity

Governments also innovate for the sake of exploring new ideas and encouraging creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This allows people to be creative in solving the [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]] faced by citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Innovation inherently involves new and uncertain outcomes, so allowing exploration helps uncover "the next big thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Similar to "entrepreneurial discovering" in the private sector, where transformative ideas often come from those with the freedom to experiment, the public sector also needs to allow its services and products to be revamped and transformed to improve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Building the Capacity to Innovate

A crucial reason for innovation is to cultivate the ability to innovate itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Innovators are not born but learn to explore new ideas and think differently through practice ("learning by doing") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

This necessitates providing a "license to explore, to experiment with new ideas" and apply them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The goal is to ensure that when a new, significant [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenge]] arises, there are people with the capacity to develop projects and solve problems in novel ways because they have prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This trend is visible in governments today, with programs for experimentation in Finland and an experimentation directive in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Staying Competitive and Prepared

Governments also innovate to avoid being left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Unexplored options can represent a cost, so it's vital to continuously explore different avenues to be prepared when one of these options becomes a necessary focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This mirrors the continuous exploration of new solutions and ideas by large private sector companies like Apple or Sony, not always for immediate application, but for future potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

All these reasons are valid drivers for governmental innovation, although they require different methods and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

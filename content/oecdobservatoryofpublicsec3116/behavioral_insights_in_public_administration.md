The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is actively engaged in integrating [[Behavioral Insights]] into public administration to enhance government effectiveness and equity, particularly through the concept of "sludge reduction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This work is a joint effort, notably in partnership with the Department of Customer Service in New South Wales, Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## What is Sludge?
Sludge refers to unnecessary "frictions" within public services that hinder access, impose psychological costs, and erode trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. While "nudge" simplifies choice architecture, sludge is its "bad brother," creating unjustified barriers to public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Common examples include difficult-to-find information, hard-to-understand processes, long waiting times without updates, and complex decision points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Often, sludging in government is unintentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Psychological Costs of Sludge
A key aspect of understanding sludge is the emphasis on psychological costs, which are challenging to measure but deeply impact individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. These include:
*   **Search Costs**: Incurred when people struggle to find information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Decision Costs**: Experienced when evaluating complex options, leading to psychological overload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Costs**: The mental resources expended to fulfill requirements or understand complex information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Emotional Costs**: Encompassing stigma, loss of autonomy, stress, disempowerment, anxiety, or frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

These psychological costs disproportionately affect vulnerable people, including not only specific vulnerable groups but also individuals experiencing difficult life moments like natural disasters or childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Sludge has the highest impact when individuals are most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

### Why Address Sludge?
Reducing sludge is critical for several reasons:
*   **Building Trust**: People's experiences with government services directly influence their perception of responsiveness and reliability, which are key drivers of trust in public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The OECD's 2021 survey on trust revealed that less than four in ten respondents believed complaining about a poorly performing service would lead to improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Policy Implementation**: Without public trust, it becomes very difficult to implement necessary policy reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Equity and Accessibility**: Sludge reduction is not just about administrative efficiency; it's about reshaping public services to be more equitable, accessible, and trusted, especially for vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## The Sludge Audit Methodology
The New South Wales (NSW) sludge audit method, inspired by Professor Cass Sunstein's work, has been developed over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. It aims to systematically apply [[Behavioral Insights]] to service improvement, quantify burdens, and guide effective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

Key aspects of the methodology include:
*   **Integration of Data**: Combining objective evidence from behavioral science with customer feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **Quantification**: Isolating and quantifying different aspects of sludge, particularly psychological costs and equity aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.
*   **Actionable Solutions**: Providing data-driven prioritization for fixes and guidance on measuring impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Four Metrics**: Time, cost, effort, and inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. The "effort" and "inclusion" components, codifying [[Behavioral Science]] evidence, are particularly unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
*   **Toolkit**: The "Sludge Finder" web tool and other resources are available for conducting audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

## International Sludge Academy (ISA)
The first International Sludge Academy, a collaboration between the OECD and NSW, piloted the sludge audit methodology outside Australia for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.
*   **Participants**: 16 teams from 14 countries were selected out of 22 interested nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **Process**: Countries attended masterclasses, received one-on-one mentorship, conducted parallel sludge audits, reviewed results, and began developing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **Diverse Applications**: Audits covered a wide range of processes, including citizen-facing public services (e.g., France, Brazil) and internal government processes like HR services (e.g., Canada, Australian federal level) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This pushed the boundaries of applying sludge audits beyond just public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

### Lessons Learned and Good Practice Principles
The ISA identified nine principles to support governments undertaking sludge audits, detailed in the paper "Fixing Frictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>:
*   **Deciding to Audit**: Consider the level of control over changing the process and the potential for implementing solutions. Data from an audit can be compelling for a business case for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Methodology Benefits**: A predefined, common methodology tested in different contexts ensures rigor, reliability, and replicability, allowing for comparisons across time and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   **Tailoring the Audit**: Adapt to complicated, non-linear behavioral journeys and deploy an equity lens. This may involve focusing on the experience of underserved communities, even if they represent a small percentage of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   **Evaluating Progress**: Translate audits into on-the-ground changes, using [[Behavioral Frameworks]] to improve services and re-auditing to measure impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
*   **System Enablers**: Success is easier with government commitment to improving services, close connection to service owners, and systematic customer survey data collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Case Studies
### France: Assistance for Independent Living (APAA)
The French [[behavioral_insights_in_government | behavioral insights]] team applied the sludge audit to the APAA application process, which provides aid for elderly people to stay at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. The problem was high dropout rates due to complexity and varying administrative letters across territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
*   **Process**: Involved interviewing 20 people across 9 departments (caregivers, applicants, professionals), reviewing forms, and walking applicants step-by-step through the process to understand time, effort, and emotional costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.
*   **Outcomes**: The audit prioritized problematic areas beyond just language simplification, focusing on processes that created inequality or complex steps for vulnerable users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>.
*   **Takeaways**: The process was user-centric, provided objective analysis, was multi-dimensional (including psychological costs and inclusion), and allowed administrations to perform self-diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. Challenges included lack of objective data and deciding whether to have full-time sludge auditors or train different administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.

### Brazil: GoBR Account Recovery
Brazil's Ministry of Management and Innovation Public Services audited the recovery process for the GoBR account, the main entry point to over 4,000 digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. While automated recovery is well-designed, a significant number of vulnerable users (106 million requests annually) must use complex online forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.
*   **Adaptation**: Brazil is developing its own tool, adapting the methodology to Portuguese and focusing on user journeys that recognize different groups of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
*   **Equity Check**: The goal is to identify who needs more guidance to avoid sludge, incorporating an "equity check" into the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.
*   **Future**: Developing a self-applied tool for federal, state, and municipal governments. Key learnings include that sludge audits are a good entry point for [[Behavioral Insights in Government]] and that the audit tool itself should avoid sludge (e.g., by simplifying questionnaires) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. There is also a discussion on finding a better, more positively framed label for "sludge audits" in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

## Future Directions and Recommendations
The OECD and its partners are committed to expanding this work:
*   **International Sludge Academy 2.0**: Building on the success of the first, the next academy will emphasize peer learning, further develop the methodology, open participation to a broader set of teams beyond just [[Behavioral Science]] (e.g., program, policy, and service delivery teams), and facilitate benchmarking of common processes across countries (e.g., passport renewal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.
*   **OECD Recommendation on Human-Centered Public Administrative Services**: A new international standard is being developed, currently open for public consultation until July 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This recommendation aims to provide a clear policy framework for developing and implementing administrative services that prioritize people in their design and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement**: While there's a surge in sludge audit adoption, more work is needed in sludge reduction. International comparisons are valuable for leveraging collective knowledge and building the evidence base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to give people more "time" by reducing the burdens imposed by unnecessary frictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>. The paper "Fixing Frictions" provides nine good practice principles to help assess, plan, and execute sludge audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>. The true impact comes from acting on audit findings to create better services, better government, and a better world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

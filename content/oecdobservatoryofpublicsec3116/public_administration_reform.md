[[Public administration reform]] is a critical and timely discussion, especially in the context of recent global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:45">[02:41:45]</a>. The focus is on strengthening the capacity of institutions and the quality of public administration to manage new challenges and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

## Context and Urgency
The last two decades have been marked by a series of crises, including the financial crisis, sovereign crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. During this period, public administration in many countries and regions became eroded and weaker, with limited possibilities for renewal, improvement, or training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Experienced civil servants often retired, further diminishing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

Despite this weakening, new and strong funding is available to boost recovery, focusing on digital transformation, greening initiatives, and a more cohesive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This presents a dual challenge: a weakened administrative "skeleton" alongside new demands and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated pre-existing trends in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>.

The quality of [[public administration transformation | public administration]] is seen as a precondition for convergence and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. This moment offers a significant opportunity to reshape institutional capacity and manage new financial opportunities for recovery within a different framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Governments are now required to make tough decisions to turn the crisis tide and deliver better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>.

## Key Drivers and Opportunities
*   **New Financial and Technical Support**: Instruments like the Technical Support Instrument at the European level and Recovery and Resilience Plans offer possibilities to reshape and reorganize the civil service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **[[Adapting public administration for digital transformation | Digital Transformation]]**: Digital solutions are central to the agenda and an opportunity for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:23:00">[34:23:00]</a>. This requires reshaping the entire way administration is managed and organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>.
*   **[[Innovative public administration practices | Innovation]]**: The pandemic led to an undeniable surge in innovation, including increased digital government adoption, rapid reskilling and reallocation of public servants, and openness to ideas from the third sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>. The goal is to carry forward this momentum and systematically build the public service's capacity to use innovation for future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:55]</a>. Investment in innovation must be prioritized to equip governments to foresee and respond to complex global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:42:00">[58:42:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Inequalities**: Crises often increase inequality, making it essential to rethink public governance tools to better promote equality and inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:44:00">[42:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02:00">[43:02:00]</a>. This includes gathering diverse perspectives in decision-making and considering the impact of policies across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations
*   **Weakened Public Administration**: The critical state of public administration in many regions requires strengthening, especially for weaker regions to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide**: Care must be taken to avoid creating a digital divide, ensuring that segments of the population in certain regions or with limited capabilities are not cut off from basic public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31:00">[35:31:00]</a>.
*   **Short-termism**: Governments tend to work on short notice, but long-term problems like climate change require sustained, concrete action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a>.
*   **Workforce Support**: While recognized during crises, the importance of the public sector workforce as a crucial asset and resource is not always consistently prioritized in day-to-day culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:41:00">[39:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:54:00">[53:54:00]</a>.

## Principles and Approaches
*   **Sound Governance**: The OECD's Public Governance Committee has focused on increasing trust in government by prioritizing three areas: the people served, the workforce, and the policies and routines driving government culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.
*   **Whole-of-Government Approach**: Governments must operate horizontally, avoiding silos by programs, budgets, or organizational structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. This requires the right skills and capabilities in the center of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.
*   **Vertical Optimization and Feedback Mechanisms**: Beyond top-down compliance, there's a need to listen and create feedback mechanisms so that frontline experiences are available to senior leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Policymaking**: Policy-making and implementation routines need to be regularly adapted based on the experiences of the workforce, managers, and the public served <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. Annual adjustments are often insufficient given the fluid nature of challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.
*   **Foresight and Future-Oriented Governance**: This includes using creative foresight exercises to envision and build necessary skills and competencies for the public sector in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-Border Collaboration**: There is a need to enhance cross-border cooperation and innovation in the face of global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>.
*   **Inclusive Policy Design**: Deliberately integrating inclusive policy design can build better policies for all and increase trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a>.
*   **Investing in the Workforce**: Recognizing the workforce as the most important asset and supporting them in day-to-day operations is crucial for effective public service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:05:00">[40:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:32:00">[41:32:00]</a>.

## Goals and Outcomes
The overall aim of [[public_administration_transformation | public administration transformation]] is to ensure governments are inclusive, innovative, and fit for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:37:00">[57:37:00]</a>. This means:
*   Driving innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:51:00">[57:51:00]</a>.
*   Harnessing new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:54:00">[57:54:00]</a>.
*   Remaining resilient and adaptive to unexpected challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:56:00">[57:56:00]</a>.
*   Being ready to act at speed and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:03:00">[58:03:00]</a>.
*   Improving [[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | citizen involvement]] in policy-making to build trust and improve reform design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:24:00">[58:24:00]</a>.
*   Applying lessons learned from crises to other pressing challenges, especially the climate crisis and [[adapting_public_administration_for_digital_transformation | digital transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:20:00">[59:20:00]</a>.
*   Shaping a future with equal opportunities for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The COVID-19 recovery provides a unique opportunity for governments to [[Public sector transformation postcrisis | transform government action, organization, and operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:44:00">[59:44:00]</a>. This requires "governing differently" to avoid reverting to old norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:54:00">[59:54:00]</a>. The European Union is actively working on proposals and providing technical support to member states to build back better with more agile, flexible, and fit-for-purpose administrative structures at central, regional, and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:18:00">[38:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>. This is essential for sustainable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

The challenge lies in making sure that generational gaps, geographical location, or social belonging do not lead to different access to public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:17:00">[53:17:00]</a>. There is an "immense amount of work to do," but the commitment to change is high among audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:44:00">[54:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Leaders are encouraged to challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of government with passion, courage, and tenacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.

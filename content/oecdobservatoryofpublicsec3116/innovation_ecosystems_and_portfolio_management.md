## Introduction to Innovation in Public Sector
The public sector is increasingly adopting strategic approaches to innovation to tackle complex policy challenges. This involves moving beyond individual projects to adopting a holistic view through [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolios]] and fostering collaborative [[building_and_orchestrating_innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This shift is crucial given the "permacrisis" of multiple parallel crises (health, energy, climate, geopolitical) and the crisis of the welfare state model, all within tight public finances and rising public demand for engagement and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

Innovation is considered core to government, enhancing agility, responsiveness, public value, service quality, and achieving better spending, especially during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. It is seen as essential for restoring trust in government and democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Public Sector Innovation
Public sector innovation has become a professionalized field, with countries institutionalizing practices and concrete measures to support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. The ability to innovate is vital for government effectiveness and stability, particularly in turbulent times and when facing complex, interrelated challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Governments need greater efficiency, agility, foresight, and the ability to guide their missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

## The Role of Innovation Portfolio Management
The [[innovation_portfolio_management | portfolio approach]] is gaining traction, encouraging governments to view innovation as a portfolio of initiatives that work together towards common goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. This approach helps manage risks across public sector activities and generates synergies between different actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:06]</a>. It is compared to the portfolio approach of venture capital firms, suggesting a "venture government" notion that explores risk and innovation across different areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

### Benefits of Portfolio Approaches
*   **Strategic Direction:** Moves innovation efforts from initial "nice-to-have" actions (like innovation weeks or prizes) to influencing the core business of government and policy making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Balance and Adaptability:** A mix of different innovation approaches helps avoid lock-in and blind spots in an organization's innovation portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>.
*   **Coordination and Synergy:** Helps develop a distribution of responsibilities, coordinate knowledge, and tailor projects for different risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>. It helps avoid fragmentation between projects and builds synergies between actions, which is critical for achieving missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>.
*   **Risk Management:** Tackles risk aversion and the fear of failure commonly cited in public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>.

### Key Innovation Facets in a Portfolio
The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) model emphasizes different types of innovation for different goals and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. A balanced [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolio]] requires multiple facets:
*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation:** Needed for complex challenges, providing directionality and clear goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>. Requires ambitious, targeted, and time-bound commitments from leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation:** Focuses on continuous improvement, efficiency, and delivering more with less, especially under austerity conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Innovation:** Builds agility to respond to citizens' needs and unforeseen situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. Requires organizational capacity to experiment continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory Innovation:** A future-oriented stance to anticipate what is coming, build strength for future challenges, and develop collective vision through foresight exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.

## Real-world Applications and Challenges
### Korea
The multifaceted innovation approach provides an envisioning statement for Korean government innovation strategy, linked to high-level public sector reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a>. It helps integrate different views, build consensus, and increase support for the public sector innovation agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:42:00">[26:42:00]</a>. This approach also encourages timely involvement and intervention from civil society stakeholders as strategic partners, creating greater synergies for challenges around public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>. Korea is using mission-oriented and anticipatory innovation to improve governmental accountability, social inclusiveness, and open/digital government, fostering ties between public and private sectors, and civil society organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>.

### Austria
Austria uses the OPSI model as an abstract framework for discussing various aspects of projects and in training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>. Projects like "Future of Work" (a real-life lab for mobile work forms) and "Digital Public Administration and Ethics" (defining ethical standards for digital technologies) are classified as anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>. Initiatives like "Greening Commutes and Duty Travels" are seen as mission-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:00">[38:07:00]</a>. While used for mapping projects and reflection, it is not yet widely used as a strategic framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:00">[39:00:00]</a>.

### Sweden (Lund)
Future by Lund, an innovation platform, focuses on [[building_and_orchestrating_innovation_ecosystems | building and orchestrating innovation ecosystems]] with external actors (municipality, companies, university, research institutes) to foster sustainable solutions, acknowledging that societal challenges cannot be solved by the municipal organization alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>. They use a "zone model" overlaid with the OPSI innovation facets model to track activities in different phases (ideation, partnership formation, scaling) and to identify gaps or opportunities within their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:33:00">[43:33:00]</a>. This approach provides a holistic view for all stakeholders and helps visualize the strength of the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:09:00">[46:09:00]</a>.

### European Commission
The European Commission manages a vast research and innovation program (Horizon Europe) with a budget of â‚¬95.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. It includes five ambitious missions with clear targets until 2030 (e.g., fighting cancer, adapting to climate change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. These missions are embedded in political priorities and managed by relevant policy services, making them integral to mainstream policymaking but also subject to burdensome decision-making rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. Horizon Europe adopts an [[building_and_orchestrating_innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystem]] view, engaging all actors from government to civil society to bring about transformational change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. A key challenge is moving from a "consultation culture" to deep co-creation with [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystem]] players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>. The Commission is undergoing an internal organizational transformation, promoting participatory leadership and breaking silos through initiatives like unifying budget lines and creating Matrix teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>.

### UAE
The UAE adopts a strategic [[innovation_portfolio_management | portfolio approach to innovation]] as a "second nature," setting ambitious visions and applying pressure to deliver, which naturally creates more diverse responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>. They identify strategic "M1 and M2" programs with short delivery timelines, requiring ministers to sign performance contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:04:00">[31:04:00]</a>. The Ministry of Possibilities works on mission-oriented innovation for "wicked policy challenges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:33:00">[32:33:00]</a>. The UAE is also part of the Agile Nations Network, unafraid to try untested ideas, such as launching the world's first regulatory authority for digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:49:00">[32:49:00]</a>. The Mohammad Rashid Center for Government Innovation keeps track of emerging innovations globally to enrich its portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>.

### Challenges in [[evaluating_impact_of_innovation_portfolios | Evaluating Impact]]
Measuring success, particularly in the context of whole systems of actors in [[building_and_orchestrating_innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]], is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:35:00">[51:35:00]</a>. Instead of "measurement," terms like "portfolio tracking" are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:26:00">[51:26:00]</a>. Tracking involves monitoring the organizations and actors involved, investment levels, and how specific events impact engagement and mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:57:00">[51:57:00]</a>. Korean society has made strides in legalizing data-driven public administration and evidence-based policy making, with various think tanks and civil society organizations developing measurement indicators and frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:58:00">[53:58:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Recommendations
*   **Organizational Setup:** Missions require not just mission-oriented policies but also mission-oriented organizations with specific capabilities and attention to their organizational setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Orchestration:** [[Building and orchestrating innovation ecosystems]] is crucial, as modern missions involve galvanizing the entire ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. This requires strong [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | stakeholder engagement]] skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Capabilities:** Public sector organizations need to develop dynamic capabilities to proactively shape issues, not just respond to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>. This requires investment in HR, training, and internal capability development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>.
*   **Strategic Options Portfolios:** A particular type of portfolio, "portfolios of strategic options," functions as learning systems to leverage emergent learning from the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53">[01:07:53]</a>. They help identify where to be in a system, what relationships are needed, and what resources and partnerships to attract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.
*   **Sense Making:** Organizations should engage in portfolio sense-making to understand their current activities, how they relate to their mandate, and existing gaps in resources or capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:36">[01:27:36]</a>.
*   **Diversity in Approaches:** Embrace diversity in sense-making approaches within organizations to avoid monolithic understanding of problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:54">[01:28:54]</a>.

The strategic approach to [[managing_innovation_portfolios | managing innovation portfolios]] is essential for navigating current and future challenges, ensuring that public sector organizations are adaptable, effective, and capable of driving transformational change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:58">[01:35:58]</a>.

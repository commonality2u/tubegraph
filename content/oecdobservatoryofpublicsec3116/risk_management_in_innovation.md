Risk management is an important aspect of [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation]] activities. Within government, a common approach to [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation]] is **enhancement-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, which is characterized by a relatively low-risk profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Low-Risk Approach: Enhancement-Oriented Innovation

Enhancement-oriented [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation]] focuses on upgrading existing systems and practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This approach aims to improve current governmental operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Characteristics and Examples
*   **Upgrading Existing Systems**: The core idea is to make current practices, systems, or ideas better, faster, or quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Common applications include improving taxation systems or using [[behavioral_insights_in_innovation | behavioural insights]] to encourage faster tax payments or more informed responses to inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These are considered forms of enhancement-oriented [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Risk Profile
The risks associated with enhancement-oriented [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation]] are generally low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This is because these innovations typically do not call for a transformation of the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Instead, they are implemented within existing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, allowing for risks to be more readily calculated and managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The focus is on improving a specific system or exploiting existing ideas to enhance current operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) developed a portfolio exploration tool to help organizations understand and manage their innovation efforts. Two key "super users," Natural Resources Wales and the City of Lund, have provided insights into how this tool and portfolio thinking are applied in real-world public sector contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>.

## Natural Resources Wales (NRW)

Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is a relatively young public body, amalgamated in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>. Wales is unique in the UK and European Union for having sustainable development enshrined in its legislation, particularly through a new environment act and the well-being of future generations act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. These acts place a statutory duty on public bodies to work collaboratively, consider future generations, and deliver a new approach to environmental management, emphasizing [[Ecosystems and multistakeholder collaboration | ecosystem thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

NRW is one of the Welsh government's largest environmental sponsored bodies, employing over 1,900 staff across Wales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Its roles are diverse, including advising the Welsh government, regulating industry and waste, designating special sites, acting as an emergency responder (air quality, marine pollution, fires), managing planning consultations, educating, providing grant aid, and gathering evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Why Innovation is Crucial for NRW

Innovation is essential for NRW due to the two major challenges facing the environmental sector: the climate emergency and the nature crisis, which are considered existential crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Current solutions are not yet fully embedded across the public sector, highlighting the need for new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

A significant challenge is how to address these grand challenges while upholding statutory responsibilities, such as regulation and enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. For example, testing new digital innovative tools must ensure the security of networks that interact with critical infrastructure like nuclear power stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Application of Portfolio Approaches

NRW, working with the Nesta Foundation and the University in South Wales, was tasked with coordinating its informal approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. The OECD's portfolio exploration tool was introduced to help structure these efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

Key benefits of using the tool included:
*   **Providing a Framework** It helped crystallize and provide a framework for existing discussions and conversations within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Wider Engagement** It enabled widening conversations about innovation beyond small groups of like-minded innovators, recognizing that "innovation is everybody's business" for NRW to meet its statutory requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Direction** It supported the need to work in a co-productive, collaborative fashion, utilize new technologies, and develop approaches to the circular economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **Robust Framework** The tool provided a robust framework for beginning portfolio development, opening new doors for partnerships and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Balance in NRW

NRW found that its innovation portfolio was very strong in the "enhancement" space, which is natural for a public sector organization with highly specialized staff. However, they identified a need to be stronger in the "anticipatory" space, as radical solutions are required for climate change and nature collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. The goal is not necessarily an equal balance across all facets, but ensuring capability in each area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

The tool helped highlight where internal processes hindered innovation, such as when an innovation fund ended up as a "small internal grant scheme" where stronger core innovations failed to progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. This revealed the importance of "selling the idea" of innovation as a core competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

NRW's formation in 2013 was itself an innovative, radical act by the Welsh government, meaning the entire organization could be considered to operate in the innovation space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. It took seven years to reach the current position with a multi-disciplinary, transdisciplinary team focusing on analysis, statistics, economics, and specialized roles in futures, innovation, [[Evaluation and sustainability in public sector innovations | evaluation]], and risk/uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. A key challenge remains scaling this support while maintaining sufficient capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. NRW considers three key aspects for innovation: culture, capability, and capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## City of Lund, Sweden

The City of Lund in Sweden operates an innovation platform, established through a program by the Swedish innovation ministry to push innovation down to the city level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Lund is a university city with a long history of major innovations (e.g., Bluetooth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. It has historically served as a test bed for early-stage developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. With new, large research facilities being built, the city anticipates an "explosion" of innovation that will significantly impact it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Approach to Innovation

A city authority typically focuses on stable service delivery (e.g., streets, healthcare) rather than acting as an innovation agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. The main challenge for Lund is to build awareness of how to leverage the potential of innovation within the city, particularly in collaborating with external partners and managing the influx of new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

The City of Lund sought to implement portfolio thinking to structure its innovation efforts, understand what they are doing, what they are not, and what they do in collaboration with others, rather than operating randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. This approach helps manage the "super storm" of innovation and navigate political contexts where various demands for action arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Management and Synergies

For Lund, the "conversation" enabled by the tool is its biggest benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. The tool provides a "starting point" for discussions and strategies by "nailing down" a current picture, which is often lacking in public sector development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

Lund observed that "enhancement" and "anticipatory" innovation are often not explicitly considered innovations within their organization, meaning they lack structured goals or resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Mission-oriented innovation, such as "climate-neutral Lund 2030," receives political attention but often lacks concrete support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

Lund's approach to portfolio management emphasizes:
*   **Combining Systematization with People Relations:** It's not just a process management system, but a "people relational oriented system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. It requires finding "champions" who will persevere despite challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   **Facilitation and Negotiation:** A neutral facilitator is needed to negotiate between different areas' needs, transforming concepts from anticipatory to enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Patience and Persistence:** Achieving results, such as the electric charging system for heavy traffic, can take years of "constant business from knitting things together in small steps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Strength-Based Approach:** Focus on successes and positive aspects, and avoid dwelling on problems to maintain engagement and prevent negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

Lund's innovation platform acts as a bridge between the city and numerous external partners (e.g., businesses, NGOs). By having a clear portfolio, they can identify where projects fit, where to hand over projects for upscaling, and how to match their portfolio with external partners' motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This allows for multi-level engagement, from strategic city council discussions to team-level actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

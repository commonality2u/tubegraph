Behavior is crucial in slowing the spread of COVID-19, particularly in the absence of a vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. In 2020, individuals had to adapt to a range of new behaviors such as washing hands, wearing masks, working from home, and getting tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This necessity placed behavioral scientists, alongside epidemiologists and public health specialists, at the forefront of efforts to manage the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

The objective of discussions among experts has been twofold: to understand lessons learned during the [[Challenges and responses during the COVID19 pandemic | crisis]] and to explore how behavioral science can influence public policy and aid [[post-pandemic recovery|post-pandemic recovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Global Context and the Role of Behavioral Science

Across different continents, the [[Government response to COVID19 | government response to COVID-19]] and the integration of behavioral science have varied:

*   **South Africa:** With a population of over 59 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, South Africa entered lockdown level one, allowing most of the economy to reopen with a midnight curfew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. As of the discussion, the country had accumulated about 750,000 cases since March, with a high recovery rate of nearly 93% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The Western Cape experienced a long, flat peak, while other provinces had sharp, high peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Behavioral science is relatively new in South Africa, though the Western Cape government has applied it for approximately eight years, notably in tackling a recent water crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The pandemic highlighted the undeniable importance of behavior change, bringing behavioral science to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Australia:** With a population of 25 million, Australia has been fortunate, reporting under 100 active cases, mostly among individuals in quarantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Life operates with relatively few restrictions, even hosting large sporting events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Australia boasts a large and active community of behavioral scientists, with around a dozen teams in the federal government (including the Behavioral Economics Team of the Australian Government (BETA) established in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>), and teams in most state governments, universities, and the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. These teams apply behavioral economics to various policy areas, including health, education, employment, energy, and cybersecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **France:** France was in its second lockdown, which began around October 30th and was set to end by December 1st (subject to change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Unlike the first stringent lockdown (mid-March to mid-May), schools remained open, and while remote work was recommended, some people continued to commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Citizens could go out for necessities or for up to an hour of walking per day by signing an exemption sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The second lockdown was less stringent, and compliance with confinement rules was not universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. With a population of 66 million, France averaged 24,000 new cases and around 400 casualties per day in the week prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Behavioral science teams were highly involved in communication efforts during the first lockdown, making information clearer, but less so during the second wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Qatar and Lebanon:** These countries represent distinct case studies due to differing institutional capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Qatar had resources for effective tracing and isolation without imposing a curfew, leading to declining numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Qatar was also the first country in the region to transparently report a large number of infections, which encouraged transparency in other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. In contrast, Lebanon experienced a disintegration of [[Government response to COVID19 | government roles]], with NGOs and IGOs filling the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Key insights from the region include:
    *   Risk perceptions are a crucial indicator of compliance with preventive measures, with higher perceived risk leading to greater compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
    *   Hard-handed measures were most effective when implemented fully and over a short period, rather than gradually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
    *   Fatigue is evident, as prolonged adherence to preventive measures leads to reduced compliance, contributing to a second wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Behavioral Science: More Important Than Ever

A poll of the audience revealed an overwhelming belief that the [[Challenges and responses during the COVID19 pandemic | COVID-19 crisis]] made behavioral science in government more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Some argue it is "as important as before" because it has always been essential for integrating the public into policy and testing what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. However, the crisis undeniably increased the perception and prevalence of behavioral science, raising public awareness and interest in drivers of behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. The need to change behaviors related to how people live, shop, and interact in society pushed behavioral science to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from the Crisis

Behavioral scientists reflect on what worked well, what needs to be left behind, and what should be done differently:

### What Worked Well & What to Keep
*   **Clarifying Information:** Behavioral science teams focused on making complex, evolving information as clear as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This involves providing the right amount of information at the right time, transmitted by trusted institutions and messengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sector Collaboration:** The level of rapid collaboration between academics, government, and sometimes the private sector was unprecedented, driven by a shared focus on combating the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. This collaborative spirit, along with knowledge sharing, should be a lasting legacy for behavioral insights teams globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Rapid Learning & Flexibility:** Teams had to quickly grasp unfamiliar concepts and adapt methodologies, moving from long-term randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to providing advice within hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. This demonstrated flexibility and adaptability in responding to urgent demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.
*   **Expanded Policy Lens:** The crisis broadened the approach to policy problems, moving beyond conventional "thinking fast and slow" biases to a wider view of [[Behavioral changes in populations postpandemic | behavioral change]] and incorporating more diagnostic tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

### What Needs to Be Done Differently & Left Behind
*   **Information Paradox:** There's a paradox between the need to give citizens ample information and the importance of not overloading their cognitive bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. More work is needed on effective use of infographics and visual information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
*   **Scientific Communication & Literacy:** Scientific communication needs improvement, especially in conveying complex, uncertain information and helping people accept the nature of scientific progress (that findings evolve with new evidence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. Scientific literacy, including understanding the scientific method, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Behavioral insights teams, often small, were forced into a pragmatic, operational mode to meet immediate and diverse demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. A potential improvement is to split resources, dedicating one agile team to rapid responses and another to anticipating long-term problems and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **Fixed Mindsets & Risk Aversion:** These mindsets, along with siloed thinking, were identified as things to leave behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Instead, quick decision-making and experimental approaches should be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

### Behavioral Science in the Evolving Crisis
Initially, behavioral science was used to encourage staying home and commitment to self-isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. As economies reopened, its role shifted to informing how to safely transition to the "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. This led to innovation in "nudges" like ringtones, messenger effects, and in-supermarket guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>. Behavioral science's core role is to facilitate the implementation of expert-driven solutions, making habits stick or desist, using evidence and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

## The Future of Behavioral Science in [[Government innovation during COVID19 | Government]] and [[post-pandemic recovery|Post-Pandemic Recovery]]

### Addressing Complex Challenges
Behavioral science has a critical role in [[post-pandemic recovery|post-pandemic recovery]], which extends beyond economic rebuilding to social fabric recovery. The pandemic caused immense strain on mental health, well-being, and dignity, leading to issues like food insecurity and gender-based violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. Behavioral science can address complex problems like early childhood development by devising responsible ways to open centers and using techniques for parental and educator engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. It can be applied to problems like gender-based violence and parental engagement, areas traditionally not considered for behavioral insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. The goal is to mainstream behavioral science within [[Government response strategies to Covid19 | government work]], ensuring a behavioral lens is applied to many policy problems, even if it's not a solution for every challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

### Empirical Evidence and New Methods
While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the "golden standard," the crisis highlighted the impracticality of long-term experimentation due to time and resource constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. This necessitates smaller pilots and adaptation to rapidly changing environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.
*   **Quasi-experimental methods:** These can be adopted for rapid assessments. Surveys, especially those with an experimental angle (e.g., testing interventions by updating perceptions in a treatment group), are valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. Regular surveys (e.g., monthly) are crucial to track changes in knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.
*   **Timely Relevance:** Policymakers need evidence-based answers quickly, not months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>. The challenge is balancing academic rigor with timely relevance, understanding which problem warrants which intervention given available time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.
*   **Multi-pronged Approach:** Solving complex problems requires a combination of behavioral, policy, and service redesign solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

### Combating Fatigue and Misinformation
*   **Fighting Fatigue:** Ongoing innovation is needed to combat fatigue with restrictions. This includes constant, salient reminders, effective messengers (e.g., health frontliners), and emphasizing harm to others and loved ones, not just oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. Providing clear options for what people can do is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. Rapid piloting of interventions is key, given constantly changing behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.
*   **Addressing Misinformation and Conspiracy Theories:** This is a huge challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.
    *   **Scientific Literacy:** Fundamental to tackling conspiracy theories is teaching scientific literacy in schools, including how opinions are formed and argumentation works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>.
    *   **Asymmetry of Argumentation:** It's easier to plant a seed of doubt (e.g., about vaccine risks) than to completely debunk it, as the latter requires proving zero risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. The "Brandolini's Law" states that the effort to refute misinformation is much greater than to create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.
    *   **Trusted Sources:** Spending more time explaining things clearly using trusted messengers (scientists, doctors) is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. The credibility of health policy workers and frontliners as information sources has increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>.
    *   **Psychological Vaccine:** Research into "inoculation theory" and "psychological vaccines" (e.g., games against fake news) shows promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>.

## Opportunities and the Future Agenda for Behavioral Science

The field of applying behavioral insights to public policy is still very young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.
*   **Governmental Integration:** A new generation of government officials will be "behavioral science-minded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. Streamlining and scaling up behavioral science in government is essential, moving beyond reliance on specific nudge units to building capacity from the bottom up within government and with NGOs/implementation partners, particularly in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>.
*   **Technological Integration:** [[Government innovation during COVID19 | Integrating artificial intelligence]] and big data will elevate the field to new levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.
*   **Ethical Standards:** Ensuring the ethics of behavioral interventions is paramount, including pre-registration of trials to promote transparency and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. This also helps assess the accuracy of predictions on what interventions will or won't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
*   **Global Collaboration:** Increased international cooperation is vital, as countries often face similar challenges simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. This includes leveraging existing networks for quick information sharing, creating "what works" centers for best practices (e.g., for health measure compliance or communication strategies), and platforms for experts and practitioners to answer questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. The focus should also be on expanding collaboration between countries in the Global South, sharing undocumented lessons and building on each other's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.
*   **Understanding Citizens:** A commitment to understanding where people come from and why they behave in certain ways is key, recognizing that behavior stems from various factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. Gathering insights directly from people on the ground, such as teachers and nurses, is valuable because their knowledge is highly relevant and pragmatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>.
*   **Empathy:** The crisis highlighted the importance of empathy, encouraging more time talking to and understanding diverse perspectives without judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>.

Administrative burdens, defined as the negative experiences and frictions individuals face when interacting with government, significantly limit access to public services and benefits, thereby reinforcing existing patterns of [[inequality_and_public_policy | inequality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This concept categorizes these experiences into three types of costs: learning, compliance, and psychological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Types of Administrative Burdens

### Learning Costs
[[Psychological and Emotional Costs in Public Service Access | Learning costs]] involve the effort required to gather information about public services, their relevance, and eligibility criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. An example is navigating the complex Medicare health insurance system in the US, which offers a vast array of choices that are difficult to understand and can have significant financial and healthcare access consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Compliance Costs
These are the most commonly recognized burdens, often associated with "red tape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. They include the time, effort, paperwork, fees, and documentation required to follow rules and requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. A prime example is the annual renewal process for Medicaid in the US, where many eligible individuals lose coverage due to the complexity of submitting required paperwork, leading to "churn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Psychological Costs
[[Psychological and Emotional Costs in Public Service Access | Psychological costs]] refer to the stress, frustration, loss of autonomy, and fear people experience when interacting with government systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. While stigma has traditionally been a focus, the concept broadens to include the broader emotional toll of navigating complex or uncaring bureaucracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. These costs can significantly impact people's trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Examples include the frustration of failed online processes during the pandemic or the distress caused by unexpected loss of health insurance due to procedural changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Key Lessons from Research

Research highlights several critical points regarding administrative burdens and [[inequality_and_public_policy | inequality]]:

*   **Small Burdens, Large Impacts**: Seemingly minor obstacles can have significant effects on program participation. For instance, in a US student loan forgiveness program, having a loan provider fill out a form for a borrower (requiring only a signature) dramatically increased application rates from 24% to 60%, resulting in substantial monthly payment reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **Reinforcing Inequality**:
    *   Individuals most in need of help are often the least equipped to navigate complex systems due to factors like language barriers, disability, illness, lack of time, or financial resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
    *   People perform less effectively under conditions of scarcity, stress, or poor health, which are common among those needing public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
    *   In the US, policies and programs primarily accessed by low-income individuals tend to be significantly more complicated to navigate than those benefiting middle-income individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Automatic Renewal as a Solution**: The most effective way to reduce burdens is through automated processes that shift the responsibility of compliance from individuals to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Simple "nudges" are less effective when high compliance and psychological costs are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

## Efforts to Reduce Burdens and Promote Equity

The Biden-Harris Administration in the US has prioritized reducing administrative burdens, particularly through executive orders focused on [[equity_and_accessibility_in_public_service_delivery | racial equity]] and customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

Key strategies include:
*   **Guidance to Agencies**: Providing directives to federal agencies on how to measure and reduce administrative burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **New Tools and Practices**: Integrating concepts like [[inclusive_services_and_public_policy_making | human-centered design]] into government policy and review processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Repurposing Existing Processes**: Mandating agencies to incorporate customer experience and burden reduction initiatives into budget preparations and performance reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The Paperwork Reduction Act has been reinterpreted to consider learning, compliance, and [[reducing_psychological_costs_in_government_services | psychological costs]], not just time spent on forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Case Studies in Burden Reduction

*   **Medicaid Automatic Renewal (Ex Parte)**: The Biden Administration has pushed states to expand automatic renewal for Medicaid, leveraging existing laws that allow states to renew eligibility if data confirms it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. This initiative increased the national average of automatic renewals from one in four to almost one in two people, saving millions from unnecessary paperwork and potential coverage loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.

    *   **Minnesota Medicaid Project**: In Minnesota, working with Code for America (a non-profit Civic Tech firm), efforts to expand automatic renewal for the aged, blind, and disabled population significantly increased coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. This intervention helped organize administrative data, connect different data sources, and provide digestible information to caseworkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. Crucially, it reduced disparities, bringing enrollment rates for non-white families, particularly Black families, up to the average of other families, thus "leveling the playing field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
    *   **US Digital Service (USDS) Interventions**: The US Digital Service, a government Civic Tech organization, deployed experts to states to help improve Medicaid renewal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. These "tiger teams" provided technical and policy capacity, helping states identify data sources for eligibility verification, fix code errors, and understand policy flexibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. This intervention successfully brought lower-performing states closer to the national average in automatic renewal rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

### Caution on Automation and [[digitalization_and_government_services | Digitalization]]

While [[role_of_technology_in_improving_government_services | technology]] can greatly reduce burdens, "blind faith technology" can also introduce bias and increase burdens if not carefully implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. Cases in Australia and the Netherlands demonstrated how automation focused disproportionately on fraud detection, leading to many false positives and shifting more burdens onto clients to prove their innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. This can cause negative outcomes, even leading to government resignations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

Furthermore, [[digitalization_and_government_services | digital]] access is not universal, particularly for older adults who may lack the necessary skills or internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. Governments must ensure digital solutions create an "easy road" for most citizens while reallocating resources to support those facing digital barriers or unusual life situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

## Lessons for Governments Facing [[challenges_faced_by_governments | Challenges]]

To successfully reduce administrative burdens and promote [[equity_and_accessibility_in_public_service_delivery | equity]] in public service delivery, governments should focus on:
*   **Culture Shift**: Building a culture that centers on the public's experience of administrative processes using tools like [[inclusive_services_and_public_policy_making | human-centered design]] and journey mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>.
*   **Capacity Building**: Developing dedicated customer experience staff whose primary role is to review and revise existing processes based on public feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.
*   **Collaboration**: Fostering inter-agency cooperation, especially for data sharing, to simplify processes and verify eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Processes**: Regularly reviewing existing systems and rules to ensure they remain fit for purpose, rather than just adding new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.
*   **Strategic [[role_of_technology_in_improving_government_services | Technology]] Use**: Leveraging [[role_of_technology_in_improving_government_services | technology]] and administrative data to shift burdens from the public to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. This requires careful evaluation to avoid unintended negative consequences, as evaluations can show whether interventions truly reduce burdens or exacerbate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>.

The **OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation** (OPSI) offers an introduction to [[public_sector_innovation_introduction | public sector innovation]] and how the [[role_of_oecd_in_public_sector_innovation | OECD]] views it, alongside problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Kevin Oren, an Innovation Specialist at [[role_of_oecd_in_public_sector_innovation | OECD]] within the [[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | Observatory of Public Sector Innovation]], presents this overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Founding and Core Functions

The [[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | Observatory]] was founded in 2016 in partnership with the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. [[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] functions in three primary ways:
*   **Uncovering What's Next** Identifying innovative practices in both [[role_of_oecd_in_public_sector_innovation | OECD]] and non-[[role_of_oecd_in_public_sector_innovation | OECD]] countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Trusted Adviser** Partnering with countries on specific issues to help them develop new ways to deliver value to citizens and solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Turning Innovation into the New Normal** Embedding innovation into the standard way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The [[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] team consists of seven individuals, all of whom have been public sector innovators and employees, bringing practical experience to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## OPSI's Perspective on Innovation

### Defining Public Sector Innovation
[[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] acknowledges that there isn't one specific [[definition_of_public_sector_innovation | definition of public sector innovation]], as everyone has their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Innovation is often recognized when seen, but its meaning is highly dependent on context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. What is innovative in one country or organization may not be in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

Three commonalities are consistently found within innovation:
1.  **Novelty** Introducing new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
2.  **Implementation** Creative ideas must be put into practice; it's a critical part of the innovation lifecycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
3.  **Impact** Implemented ideas must have a measurable effect, which can be challenging to gauge in the [[public_sector_innovation_introduction | public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Reasons for Public Sector Innovation
Based on studies, including one on Canada's innovation system and an ongoing one in Brazil, [[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] has developed a model outlining the necessity for [[public_sector_innovation_introduction | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Changing Functions**: The world is constantly changing, leading to expectations that government services also evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Service Gap**: There's a perceived gap between services received from the private sector and those from the [[the_role_of_public_sector_in_innovation | public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. The [[the_role_of_public_sector_in_innovation | public sector]] often strains just to maintain this gap, rather than closing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **No Room for Spectators**: Limiting innovation to specific labs or training restricts a government's ability to innovate comprehensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Everyone needs to be engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Increasing Citizen/Politician Expectations**: Citizens and politicians increasingly demand more from government due to evolving functions and possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. A failure to respond risks a mismatch in service provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Core Competency**: Innovation needs to be embedded everywhere as a core competency to enable better response to future crises and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

### Three Distinct Views on Innovation
[[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] conceptualizes innovation in three ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>:
1.  **Delivering on Today**: Focusing on mission-driven innovation to deliver current goals more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
2.  **Delivering on Tomorrow**: Engaging in anticipatory innovation by identifying "weak signals" and future trends (e.g., automated cars, AI, blockchain) to innovate proactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
3.  **Ensuring Readiness**: Building capacity and capability to innovate when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Key Innovation Skills

Beyond core job-specific skills, [[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] identifies several skill areas crucial for fostering a different way of thinking and achieving different results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>:
*   **Iteration**: Doing things quickly, cheaply, and with reduced risk to get faster feedback and better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Data Literacy**: Understanding how data provides insights into problems and helps measure impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **User Centricity**: Placing the end-user (citizen) at the center of government design, shifting focus from internal process efficiency to user impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Curiosity**: The ability to ask questions and seek new ways of doing things, including horizon scanning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Storytelling**: Crafting compelling, concise, and memorable stories that resonate with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Insurgency**: Questioning the status quo and trying new approaches, recognizing that those who point out issues can be valuable sources for identifying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

### Abilities, Opportunities, and Motivation (AMO) Model
Possessing these skills is important, but equally crucial is the ability to use them. The AMO model emphasizes having the **A**bilities (skills), **O**pportunities to practice them, and **M**otivation (incentives) to use them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## Innovation Lifecycle and Problem Framing

### The Innovation Lifecycle
[[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] has developed a six-step innovation lifecycle, noting that many exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. This cycle is not linear; steps may be revisited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. The steps are:
1.  **Identifying Problems**: Ensuring the right problem is being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
2.  **Generating Ideas**: Coming up with new ideas inclusively and collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
3.  **Developing Proposals**: Filtering ideas into those to pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
4.  **Implementing**: Putting selected ideas into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
5.  **Evaluating**: Assessing the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
6.  **Diffusing**: Sharing best practices and lessons learned (including failures) across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

### Problem Framing
Problem framing is the crucial first stage, as illustrated by the GE MRI machine example, where reframing the problem from a design flaw to the user experience led to a simple, effective solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

The traditional "Double Diamond" design methodology involves two main phases:
1.  **Framing the Problem**: Discovering, understanding, and investigating the problem to narrow it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.
2.  **Defining and Finding the Solution**: Ideating and narrowing down solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

However, many public servants often skip the first diamond, starting directly with solutions or being given a predefined solution to implement, leading to disappointment and ineffective results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

#### Why Problem Framing is Difficult in the Public Sector
[[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]]'s lifecycle report on problem framing identifies several reasons why the [[the_role_of_public_sector_in_innovation | public sector]] struggles with this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>:
*   **Quick Responses Over Right Responses**: There's a tendency to seek immediate solutions to symptoms rather than root causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
*   **New Information**: Constantly emerging information can change how a problem is viewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
*   **Complexity and Intimidation**: Problems can become large, complex, and intimidating, potentially moving beyond one's responsibility or autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   **Evolving Problems**: Problems can change or be entirely new, requiring continuous reevaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

New information should trigger a series of questions to better frame a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>:
*   What is known? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>
*   What is possible? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>
*   What is expected? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>
*   What is actually needed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>
*   What is the problem? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>

This process is cyclical, with continuous feedback and new information necessitating constant reevaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

#### Tips for Better Problem Framing
*   **Clarify Intent**: Understand what is actually being tried to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Make Assumptions Explicit**: Separate facts from assumptions to challenge and verify them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   **Avoid Jumping to Conclusions**: Resist the urge to quickly define the problem and move to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.
*   **Connect with Others**: Be inclusive and collaborative, bringing in diverse perspectives to broaden understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.
*   **Reframing the Problem**: Approach the problem from different angles to facilitate new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.
*   **Experimentation**: Use experiments in the problem space to better understand the problem, not just to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

#### Common Problem Identification Tools and Strategies
[[role_of_the_observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] identifies various tools and strategies, each with strengths and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>:
*   **Dashboards**: Provide data but may not articulate the "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.
*   **Horizon Scanning**: Looking at developments in other organizations or countries that have faced similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.
*   **Design Thinking/Human-Centered Design**: Focusing on user-centric design for experiences, services, and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.
*   **Systems Thinking**: Understanding the complete context and all actors involved in a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Insights**: Understanding how people behave and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Learning**: Collaborating with peers facing similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   **Learning Organizations**: Continuously seeking new methods and ways of working within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.
*   **Innovation Labs**: Structured spaces for innovation, though their effectiveness depends on structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.

A simple exercise for problem framing is the **Five Whys**, which involves defining a problem and repeatedly asking "why" to uncover deeper causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.

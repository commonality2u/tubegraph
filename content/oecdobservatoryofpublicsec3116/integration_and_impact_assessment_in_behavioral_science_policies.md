The report "Logic: Good Practice Principles for Mainstreaming Behavioral Public Policy" was launched to support governments globally in establishing and enhancing their [[Understanding Behavioral Science in Environmental Policy | behavioral science]] functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The report provides guidance on setting up [[Understanding Behavioral Science in Environmental Policy | behavioral science]] functions, determining best governance models, and ensuring the long-term impact and sustainability of [[Behavioral Public Policy | behavioral functions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Logic is based on years of rigorous research, combining data from governments worldwide with insights from [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. These principles are designed for both new and experienced practitioners of [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## The Role of the OECD

The OECD's work on [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] has three main dimensions: convening a [[International collaboration in behavioral science | Global Network of Behavioral Science experts]], enabling governments to use [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | Behavioral Science]], and advising on policy challenges through evidence generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The Logic report falls under the "enable" dimension, aiming to provide guidance and build capacity within governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Globally, over 300 institutions apply [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] to public policies, with accelerating growth, particularly since 2019, influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic which was inherently a behavioral problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Governments exhibit diverse governance arrangements for [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]], including dedicated units, specific functions in line agencies, or dispersed expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Despite this growth, practitioners face [[Challenges and Best Practices in Institutionalizing Behavioral Science | institutional challenges]], with more mature teams often reporting more difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Logic seeks to leverage collective knowledge to identify good practices for mainstreaming [[Behavioral Public Policy | behavioral public policy]] and overcoming these hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Defining [[Behavioral Public Policy | Behavioral Public Policy]]

[[Behavioral Public Policy | Behavioral Public Policy]] involves using [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] evidence to inform policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. It helps governments and policymakers:
*   **Problem Identification**: Notice and prioritize societal challenges where behaviors are counter to long-term interests (e.g., unhealthy food choices, non-utilization of government programs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. It also aids in analyzing problems and understanding behavioral drivers and barriers within social systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Policy Design**: Use [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] evidence to design policies and programs that address identified barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Policy Assessment**: Utilize tools like randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and pilot testing to de-risk policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Policy Implementation**: Optimize existing programs, maximize impact, and ensure intended outcomes are realized in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Help policymakers monitor and evaluate policy implementation to inform future problem identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Logic's Dimensions and Principles

The Logic framework organizes 14 good practice principles into five dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>:
1.  **Leadership**: Focuses on the role of leaders in encouraging [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
2.  **Objectives**: Pertains to strategy and identifying goals for [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
3.  **Governance**: Addresses how [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] fits within an organization's structure and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
4.  **Integration**: Discusses processes needed to professionalize the field and ensure sustainable demand for [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
5.  **Capability**: Refers to the skills and experience governments need to mainstream [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### Integration in [[Behavioral Public Policy | Behavioral Public Policy]]

The Integration dimension focuses on creating an enabling environment for [[Behavioral Public Policy | behavioral public policy]], ensuring that [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] evidence can be seamlessly embedded into processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Key principles include:
*   **Integrating into Standard Guidelines (Principle 8)**: Managers should integrate [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] into standard guidelines and procedures for policy development, implementation, and evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This can involve creating templates that mention [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] as part of the analysis process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   **Responsible and Open Application (Principle 9)**: Managers must ensure [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] is applied responsibly, openly, and with high integrity standards to build and maintain trust from policymakers and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Upholding ethical and research standards is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Creating Data Infrastructure (Principle 10)**: Managers should support processes and structures for data collection and analysis to facilitate diagnosing behavioral issues and evaluating policy options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. An example is Canada's [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science team]] conducting ongoing research on [[behavioral science in environmental policy | climate change]] behaviors to inform policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

### Impact Assessment and Monitoring in [[Behavioral Public Policy | Behavioral Public Policy]]

Monitoring impact is a crucial part of the Objectives dimension within Logic. This involves assessing [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] as a tool to ensure it achieves its goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Monitoring Impact (Principle 4)**: Governments should include [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] in strategic plans and monitor its use and impact over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The Netherlands, for instance, produces a bi-annual report to Parliament on the use of [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]], including case studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Designing and Improving Internal Processes (Principle 5)**: This is a growing area where countries use [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] internally to make public administration more effective, leading to better policy and program delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Country Experiences and Lessons Learned

### Finland
Finland's journey in [[Behavioral Public Policy | behavioral science]] started around 2013 with government collaborations and experimentation culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. A key turning point was a pilot project in October 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis, which advised communications teams on public behavior related to masks and vaccinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. Successful trials, like using text messages to encourage voting, led to team growth and expansion into various subject areas across ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The Finnish team emphasizes the importance of a good team, strong support from the Prime Minister's Office, and the belief that not using [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] is no longer an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. They strive to be ambitious yet humble, working collaboratively with civil servants rather than acting as consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

A major lesson learned is that building [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] into government work takes significant time and resources, with no shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. It requires working closely within the specific national context and understanding internal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. Effective communication and regular engagement (e.g., coffee mornings, research presentations) are vital to build trust and show people the ongoing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.

### United Kingdom (HMRC)
The UK's first [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral insights team]] (Nudge Unit) began its trials in HMRC (the tax authority), demonstrating quantifiable impact with trials like "nine out of ten people in your area paid their tax on time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. Initial success benefited from huge political support, which provided clout but was time-limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. A turning point was when political support shifted, leading the team to find success in "side streams"—areas with more autonomy and less status quo to fight against, such as debt management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. This allowed for building strong relationships, training junior staff, and conducting a series of trials on complex behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

Another significant turning point was the COVID-19 pandemic, where the [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science team]] had a widespread impact on the Furlough scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. Factors enabling this thorough [[Incorporating Behavioral Science in Government and Industry | behavioral input]] included:
*   **Novelty**: Being a new scheme meant no established norms, creating openness for new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.
*   **Track Record**: The team's established credibility and relationships meant they were trusted to sit at the "top table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.
*   **Senior Buy-in**: The Chancellor at the time (Rishi Sunak) was behaviorally astute and open to behavioral perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   **Opportunism**: The team was proactive in seeking out opportunities, knowing the organization well, and having strong communicators to demonstrate value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.

A key lesson learned is the challenge of maintaining subtlety in [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] interventions when scaling them up within large government organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. Often, the delicate design of interventions can be lost in the "machine" of training hundreds of staff and adapting to broad government systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.

### Brazil
Brazil's [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] journey began with isolated experiences, gaining momentum through the National School of Public Administration since 2017 with regular courses and publications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. A significant turning point was the inception of Cinco in 2023, the first [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] unit established within Brazil's new Ministry of Management and Innovation in Public Services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. This provides a unique opportunity for [[Behavioral Public Policy | behavioral science]] to influence transversal policies across the entire public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

The success of Cinco was driven by advocacy, the supportive new government structure, and a strong innovation movement within Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. The team, comprising 15 full-time civil servants from diverse backgrounds, emphasizes working *with* policymakers to develop solutions rather than simply advising them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of belonging and helps address complex problems where traditional methods have failed, such as mosquito-borne diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>. A key lesson is the importance of learning from more experienced practitioners and dealing with non-technical, political issues unique to their country's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>.

## OECD's Future Role in Reviewing [[Behavioral Public Policy | Behavioral Public Policy]] Capacity

The OECD plans to use the Logic principles to conduct country reviews on how nations organize and manage their use of [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] to improve policies and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. These reviews will compare countries against global benchmarks, providing tailored, practical advice on setting up new functions, transforming existing ones, or refining established practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. The Logic principles will serve as a diagnostic tool, allowing assessments of maturity across different dimensions, such as leadership, objectives (including impact monitoring), and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This aims to help governments worldwide improve their application of [[Behavioral Insights for Public Policy | behavioral science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

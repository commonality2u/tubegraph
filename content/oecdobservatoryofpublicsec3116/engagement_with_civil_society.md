Mission-oriented innovation emphasizes a collaborative approach that actively involves citizens and civil society organizations. This engagement is crucial for framing, implementing, and evaluating missions to ensure their success and long-term support.

## The Importance of Citizen Engagement
Effective mission-oriented innovation policies require framing that is understandable and motivating for wider audiences and various segments of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This necessitates the involvement of citizens and civil society to ground abstract goals in tangible, relatable experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

Traditional government policies often focus on short-term, siloed goals, which can hinder the ability to address cross-cutting problems like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. Missions offer a way to reframe policy goals over a longer period, creating a roadmap for collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>. Engaging with citizens and diverse stakeholders helps ensure that these goals align with societal needs and remain relevant beyond political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.

## Examples of Engagement in Practice

### Sweden's Vinnova Agency
Vinnova, Sweden's innovation agency, exemplifies a bottom-up approach to engaging citizens in mission design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. They conducted numerous meetings and workshops to involve citizens in shaping missions related to healthy and sustainable food and sustainable mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This engagement helped to focus on visible, relatable aspects such as decarbonizing food habits or making streets livable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

Vinnova successfully engaged diverse groups, from school children to the prime minister, in collaborative design workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. This approach demonstrates that missions are neither solely top-down nor entirely bottom-up, but a combination, leveraging both political leadership and grassroots input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. This [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | collaboration between governments and citizens]] is crucial for fostering [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | citizen engagement]] and ensuring ideas from the ground are brought forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

### Health Holland in the Netherlands
Health Holland, tasked with extending the healthy lifespan of Dutch citizens by five years by 2040, adopted a [[citizencentered_governance_and_engagement | participatory experimental process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. They recognized that achieving such a complex mission, which involves changing human behavior, requires the commitment of many organizations and communities at multiple levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. This highlights the need for continuous experimentation and a dynamic approach, as not all trials will succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

## The Role of Civil Society Organizations
[[the_role_of_civil_society_in_crisis_management | Civil society organizations]] (CSOs) play an increasingly vital role in driving mission-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. Their engagement is often indispensable due to the long-term commitment missions represent, which extends beyond typical political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. CSOs can provide crucial societal support, especially in strong democracies like Sweden or Denmark, where they represent a wide range of voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

In the context of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, governments rely on the buy-in from [[citizen_engagement_and_trust_in_uncertain_times | citizens and civil societies]] to implement recovery plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. CSOs help ensure that missions are not just ambitious policy goals, but are understood and supported by the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Without genuine engagement, ambitious policy goals might remain unknown to the wider public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>.

## Challenges and Strategies for Inclusive Engagement
A significant challenge is avoiding the "lock-in effect," where engagement is limited to core teams or closely connected partners, potentially missing crucial perspectives and action points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>. To counter this, missions must be extremely inclusive, building a "community of the willing" and actively listening to underrepresented voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

Strategies for overcoming [[civic_participation_challenges | challenges]] and fostering engagement include:
*   **Prototyping and Demonstrating:** Quickly creating visible prototypes of proposed changes, like transforming streets or food systems, helps citizens understand the impact of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.
*   **Generating Buy-in:** Engaging society from the outset leads to stronger buy-in rather than trying to sell a mission later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>. This "real engagement" goes beyond simply sharing plans or asking for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Social Movements:** What becomes important to politicians is often shaped by the public's concerns. Social movements, like those driven by figures such as Greta Thunberg, can quickly elevate topics to become government missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.
*   **Building Networks and Lobbying:** Even when policy levers are outside a city or agency's direct control, building relationships and lobbying with partners at other levels of government can help advance the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>. This requires innovators to be ingenious in creating collaborative networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.
*   **Addressing Internal Resistance:** Overcoming internal resistance within public organizations means building support structures for experimentation and allowing for trial and error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>. This may involve demonstrating the success of new approaches or introducing new tools like strategic design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. Opening up bureaucracy and generating a risk-taking attitude can also facilitate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>.

The ability to successfully implement missions also depends on building new capabilities and capacities within government, and sometimes managing staff turnover if individuals are unwilling or unable to adapt to new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. This highlights the ongoing need for [[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | public sector innovation]] and adaptation.

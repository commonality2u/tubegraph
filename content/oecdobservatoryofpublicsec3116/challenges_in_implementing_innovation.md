Innovation is crucial for governments to adapt to a changing world and improve public outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, its implementation in the public sector faces numerous [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation_in_the_public_sector | challenges]].

## Defining Innovation

Within the OPSI (Observatory of Public Sector Innovation), innovation is defined by three pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>:
1.  **Novelty**: It must be new or novel to the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
2.  **Implementation**: It needs to be implemented, moving beyond just an idea to actual action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
3.  **Impact**: It should have an impact or shift public value, improving public outcomes or serving the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Learning from failures or understanding successes is crucial for future leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Why Innovation Matters

Innovation helps governments:
*   **Keep pace with change**: Governments are often "path dependent" and "slow moving machines," needing proactive approaches to engage with new technology, opportunities, and changing contexts like uncertainty and volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Build trust with citizens**: Designing and delivering services that meet citizen needs fosters trust, a relationship that can fluctuate, as seen during the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Explore uncertainty**: Innovation serves as a critical resource to explore uncertainty and steer towards preferred futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Improve public value**: Ultimately, the goal is to improve public services and the lives of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Key [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | Challenges in Public Sector Innovation]]

A poll conducted during the "Government Beyond Recovery" conference revealed top [[challenges_in_public_sector_innovation | challenges in public sector innovation]]:
1.  **Lack of Vision and Leadership**: The number one challenge identified was a lack of vision and leadership to move on from old ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
2.  **Reaching Forgotten Groups**: Another significant challenge is reaching groups that feel forgotten or left behind, which requires building relationships through innovative methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

Quotes highlight the urgency:
> "If we talk about climate change by far the biggest challenge is innovation. If we only deal with the consequences we will never solve the problem." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> - Prime Minister Janice Johnson
> "If nothing happens the political risk is higher than if something happens. Something has to happen and something has to change." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a> - Guitar Rickard
> "One thing is clear public administration should not mouse back to its normal old ways of working as they were before the pandemic because the old ways of working will not be able to keep up with the fast paced pace of changes in the workplace." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a> - Peter Pogbachar

While many public managers acknowledge lessons learned (52.3%), they are not always willing to change behaviors or take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This highlights a need to equip them with tools and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Participant-Identified Barriers

During a webinar, participants identified the following [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation_in_the_public_sector | barriers to innovation]] in their contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>:
*   Challenges in the proof of concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>
*   Dealing with strict hierarchies and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>

*   Lack of flexibility and bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>
*   Fear of change and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>

### Panelist Perspectives on Barriers

Panelists from Denmark, Belgium, and Slovenia echoed many of these [[challenges_in_public_sector_innovation | challenges]]:

*   **Challenging the Status Quo / Mindset**: Frederick Bob Futz (Belgium) notes that questioning the status quo creates resistance, as employees may worry about their work or position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>. Matia Codra (Slovenia) emphasizes that the "biggest barrier is the mindset," requiring openness to new ideas and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.
*   **Hierarchical Approaches**: These make it difficult to utilize the full potential and knowledge of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.
*   **Fear of Losing Control / Undesired Results**: Senior public servants may fear being seen as incompetent when invited to try innovative ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>.
*   **Lack of Knowledge, Skills, and Tools**: Matia Codra points to a lack of "social innovation skills" (collaboration, inclusion, co-creation, system thinking) and even primary skills like listening and thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>. Problems are often addressed in old ways, lacking a systemic view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.
*   **Political and Financial Support**: Leaders often want quick results, but these cannot be achieved without proper support in knowledge and competencies, especially in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.
*   **Procurement**: Frederick Bob Futz highlights procurement rules as a significant obstacle to experimentation in Belgium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.
*   **Organizational Mobility**: Lina Collierson (Denmark) mentions frequent job changes in the civil service as an "everyday barrier" to sustained innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Lack of Incentives**: Denmark's national center lacks direct incentives like funding for innovation calls, requiring them to "lure people" into collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

## [[Challenges and strategies in implementing public sector innovation | Strategies for Overcoming Innovation Challenges]]

Panelists offered various [[overcoming_innovation_challenges | strategies for overcoming challenges in innovation projects]]:

### 1. Building Infrastructure and Long-Term Vision
*   **Patience and Consistency**: Building innovation infrastructure takes time and consistent work over a long period. Denmark's bicycle infrastructure, for example, took 60 years of political decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Long Game**: Work towards long-term goals, understanding that different approaches (bottom-up, top-down) will be needed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

### 2. Engaging Leadership and Stakeholders
*   **Political Inclusion**: Politicians are accountable for public services and their inclusion in innovation work is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Support for political leadership of public sector innovation and strengthening collaboration between civil servants and politicians is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.
*   **Demonstrate Value**: Present innovation as a "means to a goal" rather than a goal itself, focusing on improving outcomes and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.
*   **Connect to Management Objectives**: Understand what is important to managers and connect innovation initiatives to their objectives and desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.
*   **Show Results, Not Just Process**: Accelerate the sharing of "learnings and results stories" early on, rather than just process stories, to secure long-term management buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.
*   **Clear Ownership**: Ensure that project sponsors are committed and have the mandate to design, deliver, and implement solutions in a co-creative manner, with clear task and project owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.

### 3. Fostering a Culture of Innovation
*   **Start Small and Persist**: Even seemingly small actions, like government officials talking to citizens, can be difficult to initiate but become normalized over time if consistently pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.
*   **Open Mindsets**: Work with open-minded people and build a "coalition of the willing" rather than wasting energy on those resistant to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.
*   **Safe Experimental Space**: Establish an experimental space where mistakes are allowed as part of an institutional learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.
*   **Training and Knowledge**: Implement innovation training programs for employees to change perspectives on workflow, problem-solving, and effective communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.
*   **Empower Individuals**: Empower "innovation ambassadors" who actively participate in the community and implement knowledge in their work environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **"Start by Starting"**: Don't wait for the entire system to be ready; find windows of opportunity and places where it's possible to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>.
*   **Focus on Core Business**: Innovation should be embedded in "everyday practices" and core functions, not just seen as a "flashy" or "whipped cream" addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>.

### 4. Collaboration and Networking
*   **Platforms and Networks**: Facilitate innovation by building platforms and networks for knowledge sharing and experience exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.
*   **Cross-Silo Collaboration**: Denmark's history of digital government has fostered collaboration across silos, which is increasingly important for solving complex problems like climate change and demographic [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **Innovation Community**: Build strong national innovation communities where employees and partners from public, private, and academic sectors can network, learn, and transfer good practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
*   **Global Networks**: Be part of a global network to learn from good practices and adapt them to local environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>.

### 5. Problem-Oriented Approach
*   **Challenge-Driven Innovation**: Focus on solving specific needs, problems, and [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | challenges]] with hands-on innovation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. Framing the problem is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.
*   **Systemic View**: Adopt a challenge-based system approach that seeks holistic solutions to problems, not just symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.
*   **Address Tangible Issues**: Engage top leaders and politicians by focusing on the specific, tangible problems they are responsible for fixing (e.g., aging population, flooding), as these often have inherent future-oriented and mission-oriented aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>.

### 6. Regulatory Frameworks
*   **Enabling Regulation**: Develop effective legal frameworks that encourage innovation and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>.
*   **Free Municipality Experiments (Denmark)**: This initiative allows municipalities to be exempt from certain regulations to test new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>. It not only leads to measured results but also creates a "massive cultural impact" by legitimizing experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.

## Types of Innovation Activities (OPSI Facets)

The OPSI framework helps understand different types of innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>:

1.  **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation**: Characterized by "quick wins" and doing things better, often incremental improvements that are easy to showcase results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:45">[01:14:45]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Shift to e-signatures in the Canadian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Estonia's proactive family benefit system, which automatically identifies new parents and informs them of available services, reducing citizen burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>.
2.  **Adaptive Innovation**: Involves adjusting to changing circumstances and necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Forced shift to telework during COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Japan's agile governance model, a constant cycle of understanding changing conditions, risks, setting new goals, developing, implementing, and evaluating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.
3.  **Mission-Oriented Innovation**: A strong approach to addressing complex, difficult targets, often multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>.
    *   *Example*: European Commission's mission areas centered around climate change (e.g., climate neutral cities, healthy oceans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>. This approach involves collective problem definition, solution development, and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
    *   This is a chance to address complex [[challenges_of_a_multifaceted_innovation_approach | challenges in advance]] and steer towards desired futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
4.  **Anticipatory Innovation**: A cutting-edge field focused on engaging with uncertainty and working with the future, aiming to create "evidence about the future in the present" to inform decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.
    *   *Example*: A strategic foresight exercise with the government of Slovenia, imagining four different future worlds (e.g., elite mobility, localized world, greater polarization, intergenerational interaction) to understand implications for the public sector and inform policy decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>. This helps prepare for possible futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>.

While there's a tendency to lean towards enhancement-oriented approaches, the focus is shifting towards more complex [[challenges_and_strategies_for_implementing_anticipatory_innovation | innovation challenges]] like mission-oriented and anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:28]</a>.

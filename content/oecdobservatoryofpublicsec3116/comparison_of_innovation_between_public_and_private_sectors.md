The study of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] systems involves drawing lessons from both [[private_sector_innovation | private sector innovation]] theory and practice, as well as experiences within the public sector itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. While governments have been innovating, it has often been an "ad-hoc, reactive, opportunistic activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, contrasting with the need for innovation to be a "consistent, deliberate, reliable resource" in a changing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

[[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] in the public sector is inherently complex and difficult to master, with no government worldwide having fully achieved it yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Determinants of Innovation: Public vs. Private Sector

A useful approach to understanding [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] is to compare its structural forces and resulting behaviors with those of the [[private_sector_innovation | private sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. This comparison highlights why significant differences exist in how innovation manifests in each domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

### Clarity: Reason for Innovation
*   **Private Sector:** There is a very strong and clear signal for innovation: profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
*   **Public Sector:** The signal is often politics, which is changeable, noisy, and can present multiple signals simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. If innovation has to compete with clearer, more pressing agendas, it will often come second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

### Parity: Marketplace for Ideas
*   **Private Sector:** A marketplace for ideas exists, where an employee's idea might be taken up by their current employer or, failing that, could be taken to a competitor or used to start a new business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. This threat of competition encourages consideration of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   **Public Sector:** There is typically no threat of competition for existing functions. Individuals with new ideas must contend with incumbent forces, unless there's a clearly understood and identified opportunity or need that pushes the innovation forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

### Suitability: Investment in Emergent
*   **Private Sector:** Investment in emergent and cutting-edge ideas occurs due to strong feedback loops that dictate what to invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. What works often gets scaled, copied, or built upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.
*   **Public Sector:** Feedback loops tend to favor what is already understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. Waiting until something is fully understood risks the government becoming a "taker" rather than a "shaper," reducing its ability to engage with and leverage innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

### Normality: Acceptance of Difference
*   **Private Sector:** If something generates profit, it is accepted as normal, even if it seems illogical, because it provides clear feedback within the system that it is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **Public Sector:** [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] is often perceived as an exception, something unusual or a "frolic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. As long as it remains seen as marginal, it will be difficult to make it a routine part of government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. Government traditionally focuses on replicating behaviors and standardization, rather than embracing difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

These four determinants are interdependent. For example, without clarity, it's difficult to achieve parity, making it hard to invest in suitability, and without investment, innovation won't become normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

## Challenges in Public Sector Innovation

*   **Risk Aversion:** The public sector, particularly in contexts like Canada, exhibits risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. This is a structural issue, as the public sector will always be conscious of risk due to its incentives and feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. The challenge is to balance this by increasing the perceived risk of *not* innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>. Focusing on outcomes rather than activities can shift risk perception, as payments can be tied to achieving results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact:** Measuring the [[impact_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | impact of innovation]] is difficult because it often involves doing new things without established performance targets or standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. Old metrics may not apply to new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.
*   **"Clay Layer" (Middle Management):** Frustration with middle management is a universal issue in bureaucratic and hierarchical organizations, suggesting it's a structural challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>. Middle management acts as a filter for information flow, and solutions might involve creating forums for sharing and developing ideas to a more sophisticated level before requiring direct managerial attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>.
*   **Grassroots vs. Top-Down:** In large, complex, and changeable systems, the ability to "command and control" all appropriate responses is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>. Everyone needs some capacity to engage with and be ready for innovation, as the need might arise anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. Public servants often feel they need explicit permission to innovate, even when implicit permission has already been given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.

## Adapting to Change

While the public sector cannot become like the [[private_sector_innovation | private sector]], it can enhance its capacity for [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] by strengthening the signals it sends internally regarding its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. This requires understanding the underlying system and making implicit factors explicit to empower individuals within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>.

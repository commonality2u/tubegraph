Governments innovate for various reasons, sometimes with a clear purpose and other times to foster a general environment of exploration and development. Both scenarios can lead to positive outcomes for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Directing Innovation Towards Specific Challenges

One key motivation for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] is to address specific, known challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Problem-Driven Innovation** Governments may precisely identify challenges, such as the need to clean oceans or solve homelessness, and then seek innovation specifically to reach those targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This approach provides clear direction for innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The problem itself legitimizes the need for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Fostering Exploration and Creativity

Governments also innovate for the sake of allowing people to explore new ideas and be creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty and Discovery** Innovation is inherently new and uncertain, making it difficult to predict where the "next big thing" will emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Therefore, allowing individuals to explore new ideas is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Lessons from the Private Sector** In the private sector, this is referred to as "entrepreneurial discovery," where transformative ideas often come from individuals with the freedom to "play around" and explore new thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Examples include the combustion engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This exploratory approach should also be permitted in the [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Service Improvement** [[Public sector innovation | Public sector]] services and products also require revamping and transformation to improve their quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Developing Innovation Capacity

A third motivation for civil servants to engage in [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] is to build the inherent ability to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Learning by Doing** Innovators are not born but learn to explore new ideas and think in new ways through practiceâ€”a process known as "learning by doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Building Future Readiness** Governments need to grant a "license to explore" and experiment with new ideas, applying them in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This ensures that when new challenges arise, the [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]] has personnel with the capacity to develop projects and solve problems in novel ways, having previously done so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Current Trends** This approach is a current trend in governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   **Finland** has a new program focused on experimentation at the central government level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   **Canada** has implemented an experimentation directive, allowing different government departments to test policy ideas before widespread application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Staying Relevant and Competitive

Finally, governments also innovate to avoid being left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Peer Influence** Governments may innovate because neighboring countries or other entities are doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This is a valid reason, as unexplored options represent potential costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Relevance** It is necessary to explore various options to remain competitive and prepared for when an option becomes critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Private Sector Parallel** Large private sector companies, such as Apple or Sony, continuously explore different solutions and new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. They do this not always with an immediate application in mind, but because those explorations might become significant in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

All these motivations are valid reasons for [[public_sector_innovation | government innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. However, it's important to note that these distinct innovation activities often require different methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

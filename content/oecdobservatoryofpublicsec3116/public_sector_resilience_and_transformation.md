## Introduction

The current global landscape is characterized by significant uncertainties, including the ongoing [[lessons_learned_from_the_covid19_crisis_and_the_future_of_public_sector_resilience | COVID-19 crisis]], geopolitical conflicts like the war in Ukraine, an energy crisis, and high inflation across many countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In these challenging times, the public sector serves as a crucial cornerstone for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These multifaceted crises have presented an opportunity to build even more [[building_resilient_and_adaptive_government_systems | resilient public sector]] systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Imperative for Resilience and Proactive Governance

Recent events underscore that anticipatory innovation and foresight are essential components of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. When change occurs and crises strike, citizens turn to public administrations, necessitating preparedness and proactive planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. European administrations face increasingly complex policy issues, and governments at all levels must enhance their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. In a world grappling with "super wicked problems" such as climate change and "black swan" events like [[lessons_learned_from_the_covid19_crisis_and_the_future_of_public_sector_resilience | COVID-19]], coupled with the complex multi-level governance structures of the EU and globalization, the task for public administrations is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

Complexity, however, can be managed with appropriate decision-making and cooperative systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The primary challenge for public administrations is [[building_resilient_and_adaptive_government_systems | building resilience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. This resilience stems from a combination of stable, efficient processes and structures that deliver quality services and policies, alongside a capacity for disruption that allows for challenging, innovating, adapting, and ultimately improving public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## Finland's Public Sector Transformation

Finland is currently undergoing one of its most significant [[public_sector_transformation | public sector transformation]]s, involving the creation of welfare counties, which represents an entirely new level of public governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This transformation, combined with numerous recent crises, has compelled Finland to work harder, identify core valuable issues, and be more proactive in tackling emerging challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Finland intends to take concrete steps to shift towards proactive governance, with initial necessary actions planned for the next government term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This endeavor is viewed as a "marathon, not a sprint," with readiness expected by the end of the 2020s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Finland is strongly committed to international collaboration, aiming to share its experience and developed know-how in governance system development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## European Commission's Support for Anticipatory Innovation Governance

The European Commission, through its Directorate-General for Structural Reform Support, actively coordinates policy-making related to the quality of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. It has conducted studies, comparisons, and exchanged insights with member states and experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The Commission supports member states in adopting anticipatory innovation governance within their public administrations, providing financial and technical support, intellectual advice, and inspiring project examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Examples of Commission support include:
*   Work with the OECD in Latvia to build an innovation lab, fostering capacity to disrupt public administration through analysis and policy design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   Efforts in Ireland to learn from [[Public Sector Innovation in Response to COVID19 | COVID-19 crisis management]] to enhance future crisis planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   Two high-impact multi-country projects focused on building capacity for evidence-informed policy-making in governance and public administration in a post-pandemic Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   A project with the OECD, Greece, Belgium, Czechia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands on [[building_resilient_and_adaptive_government_systems | strengthening the resilience of public administration]] after the [[lessons_learned_from_the_covid19_crisis_and_the_future_of_public_sector_resilience | COVID-19 crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   A project involving 12 member states (Belgium, Bulgaria, Austria, Croatia, Italy, Finland, Spain, Poland, Portugal, Greece, Slovenia, and Slovakia) to improve foresight and innovation capacity using the Common Assessment Framework 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

The Finnish example offers valuable insights into how high-performing administrations like Finland continuously improve their capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Key takeaways from this work include:
*   The need to increase civil servants' capacity to reflect on future policy challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   The creation of long-term planning for short-term democracies through revised policy-making and budgetary processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   Improved dialogue between politicians and public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

The findings from the Finland project are intended to serve as a blueprint for other member states to enhance their planning and adaptability for future evolutions and crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## Future Challenges for European Administrations

The European Commission has identified five key future challenges where anticipatory innovation capacity will be crucial:
1.  **Unprecedented speed of technological change**: Requires adapting administrative working and decision-making methods and enabling human-centricity in public service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. It presents an opportunity to rethink, redesign, and redeploy administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
2.  **Impact of demographic changes and increasing skills shortages**: New skills are necessary to address these challenges and ensure the successful implementation of reform and recovery packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
3.  **Increasing complexity of managing policy issues**: Encourages a culture of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] as a central part of public administration functioning at all levels of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
4.  **Impact and importance of the green transition**: To achieve Europe's goal of becoming the world's first climate-neutral continent, administrations need to ensure leadership competence, a sound knowledge base, accountability, and transparency in policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
5.  **Increased competition for limited public funding**: Requires prioritization through leadership and innovative thinking, and improved financial management to address issues of intergenerational fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

Across all these challenges, administrations need to create more room for strategic thinking and experimentation in policy-making, build capabilities, and focus on the continuity of reforms beyond government terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## The Anticipatory Innovation Governance Model

Anticipatory innovation involves creating knowledge about the future and making decisions based on that knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. It's about taking action today towards a future outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. A governance system is needed to support this process, enabling governments to innovate towards future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

The model developed with Finland included:
*   **Agency**: The ability to use different tools and methods, make sense of the future, explore alternatives, and develop organizational capabilities for disciplinary work and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   **Authorizing Environment**: A feedback system that legitimizes anticipatory work, includes evaluation of current policies for future resonance and readiness, and fosters dialogue with citizens about desired futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

This framework was used to assess Finland's government and organizations, looking at both the agency of public servants and their authorizing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

### Implementation in Finland

Finland's work on [[Public Sector Innovation and Digital Transformation | anticipatory innovation governance]] identified several challenges, including organizational, individual, and procedural hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. The analysis focused on thematic issues such as making anticipatory innovation more democratic, integrating anticipatory knowledge into budgets and investments, exploring alternatives, identifying necessary capacities, and ensuring continuity across policy cycles and government coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

Key findings indicate that anticipatory innovation functions need to be integrated into existing government functions like strategy planning, budgetary decisions, legislation, and human resource development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. Additionally, new government functions are needed, such as a "government transition function" to ensure continuity of complex policies across government terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>, and clearer planning functions for analyzing emerging issues and assigning responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

Action points for the Finnish government include:
*   Systemizing the transition process to improve continuity of long-term reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.
*   Developing methods to plan responses to emerging issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.
*   Establishing structures for regular collective sense-making and exploration of alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.
*   Testing new approaches to allocate resources to emerging phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.
*   Incorporating future-oriented data into fiscal planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   Regulatory approaches to support experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.
*   Designing training teams and roles for anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   Institutionalizing dialogue and deliberation with citizens and politicians to build trust on uncertain topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
*   Connecting foresight systems with policy-making to create a value chain of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
*   Tracking and assessing the use of anticipatory approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.

The Ministry of Finance in Finland plays a key role in coordinating the implementation of these areas, emphasizing that it's a marathon, not quick wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. They are already advancing citizen participation through initiatives like the Finnish National Dialogue Models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. Critical steps include ensuring continuity of long-term reforms during government transitions and establishing a standing committee to link anticipatory issues to core processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.

## International Perspectives on Anticipatory Innovation Governance

The concept of anticipatory innovation governance has broader applicability, with other countries sharing similar [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_sector_digital_transformation | challenges and opportunities in public sector reform]].

### The Netherlands
The Netherlands, being an open country with broad policy discussions, sees the anticipatory innovation governance model as fitting well, although they are not yet implementing it in a structured way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management is working on issues like artificial intelligence, well-being economics, hyperloops, flying cars, data science, and digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. A key challenge is translating innovations into policy, as public servants are often risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. Long-term issues like infrastructure projects can be sustained across governments due to dedicated funding, but new policies or innovation phases struggle with funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. Equipping civil servants involves providing toolboxes for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>.

### Norway
Norway shares similarities with Finland in its society and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. They see the model as a way to strengthen a Nordic approach by exploring and applying anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. Norway is developing initiatives at municipal, regional, and government levels to challenge silos and foster collaboration on complex systemic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. Anticipatory activities like scenario planning and horizon scanning are used to create robust policies, strategies, and future-fit public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. Examples include:
*   The Norwegian Defense Research Establishment's five scenarios on information influence on elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.
*   The 2019 white paper on [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation in the public sector]], which developed public sector scenarios for 2040 and highlighted foresight as a critical competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>.
*   The "Seamless Services Program" which uses foresight to ensure new services meet future user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.

To get started, Norway aims to develop "future literacy" and connected skills for public sector leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>, and learn from international cases, particularly Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. There is a growing interest in anticipatory methods, and Norway aims to make them available to municipalities, agencies, and ministries for experimentation and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>.

### Portugal
Portugal, despite its geographical distance from Finland, faces similar global challenges of uncertainty and limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. The new institution "Planape" at the core of the Portuguese government focuses on planning, foresight, public policy monetization, and policy evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. It is part of a broader European trend to bring foresight and anticipatory innovation to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>. Planape aims to cut across silos and provide a more holistic response to future challenges and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.

Other initiatives include an "Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit" developed with the agency for modernization of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>, and the launch of the "Ministries of the Future" initiative and the "Network of Foresight of the European Union" during Portugal's 2021 EU Council presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Many line ministries in Portugal have entities dedicated to strategic thinking, innovation, and future anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>. A critical role for Planape is to unlock and combine existing capacities across the public administration and serve as a platform for sharing information and capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>. Capacity building and reinforcing skills are of critical importance due to a past loss of public administration capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. Portugal is also undertaking the "2050 Lab" project, a participatory visioning effort to involve civil society and citizens in imagining Portugal's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>.

## Key Takeaways and Future Outlook

A crucial lesson from Finland's experience is that [[Public sector innovation and digital transformation | anticipation is not an extra layer]], but an essential driver for [[sustaining_public_sector_transformation_beyond_crisis | public sector effectiveness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>. It is viewed as part of the culture of a modern public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:19">[01:26:19]</a>. Anticipation enables governments to avoid remaining static, allowing them to explore possibilities, experiment, and continuously learn within the broader governance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>.

The demand for anticipatory work doesn't primarily come from laws, but from the recognition that traditional reactive approaches are too resource-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>. Bringing different communities (innovation, core processes, open government, civil servant capabilities) together has been a core strength, fostering a shared understanding and demand for proactive approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>.

Citizen involvement is paramount in the anticipatory approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:04">[01:17:04]</a>. It is crucial to engage citizens in discussing not only current issues but also future anticipatory issues, leveraging their knowledge to build trust and [[building_resilient_and_adaptive_government_systems | resilience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>. Proactive engagement, rather than just reacting to crises, helps build citizen confidence and trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>. Research suggests that citizens' trust in government is linked to their perception of government's ability to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:59">[01:26:59]</a>.

Finland's blueprint for anticipatory innovation governance serves as a pioneering example for other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:39">[01:28:39]</a>. This experience will be used in upcoming projects, for instance, in Ireland (competency framework for senior leaders), Italy, Lithuania, Malta (exploring capabilities), Sweden (connecting anticipation to risk management), and Flanders and Belgium (linking anticipation to recovery and [[building_resilient_and_adaptive_government_systems | resilience plans]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:14">[01:29:14]</a>. These anticipatory innovation approaches are not merely "nice-to-have" but are critical for integrating how governments work and deliver in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>.

Recent global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Europe, and the energy crisis, have highlighted an unclear future with high inflation and numerous problems across different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These challenges present a significant opportunity to build an even more [[resilience_and_agility_in_government | resilient public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The public sector is recognized as the cornerstone in difficult situations for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, necessitating a focus on identifying strengths and areas needing improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Finland's Transformative Approach

Finland is currently undergoing one of its largest [[public_sector_transformation_postcrisis | public sector transformations]], including the creation of welfare counties, which represents a completely new level of public governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This, combined with recent crises, has made it essential to work harder, find core valuable issues, and be more proactive in tackling arising challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Finland intends to take concrete steps towards proactive governance, with initial steps planned for the next government term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This transformation is viewed as a marathon, not a sprint, with completion hoped by the end of the 2020s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Collaboration with the international arena, including the OECD and the European Commission, is a strong commitment for Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## The Role of Anticipatory Innovation Governance

Recent events underscore that anticipatory innovation and foresight are essential elements of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Citizens turn to the public sector during change and crisis, highlighting the need for preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The European Commission actively supports member states in improving anticipatory innovation governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### European Commission's Support and Challenges

The European Commission's Directorate-General for Structural Reform Support coordinates policy-making on the quality of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. European administrations face increasingly complex policy issues, described as "super wicked problems" like climate change and "black swan events" such as COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Complexity can be managed with the right decision-making and cooperative systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The Commission provides financial and technical support, offering advice and intellectual guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

Inspiring projects supported by the EC include:
*   Building an innovation lab in Latvia with OECD expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   Drawing lessons from the COVID-19 crisis management to increase state capacity for future crisis planning in Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   Multi-country projects on building capacity for evidence-informed policy-making in a post-pandemic Europe, involving numerous member states like Greece, Belgium, Czechia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   Strengthening [[resilience_and_agility_in_government | resilience of public administration]] after the COVID-19 crisis using the Common Assessment Framework 2020, involving 12 member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

The Finnish example provides valuable insights for other member states on continuously improving capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. Key takeaways from this work emphasize:
1.  Increasing the capacity of civil servants to reflect on future policy challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.
2.  Creating long-term planning for short-term democracies through revised policy-making and budgetary processes, and better dialogue between politicians and public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
The findings from the Finland project can serve as a blueprint for other member states to plan and adapt better to evolutions and future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>.

### Upcoming Challenges for European Administrations

The European Commission has identified five future challenges where anticipatory innovation capacity will be crucial:
1.  **Unprecedented speed of technological change:** Requires adapting administration working methods and decision-making, enabling human-centricity in public services, and rethinking/redesigning services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.
2.  **Impact of demographic changes and increasing skills shortages:** New skills are necessary to develop solutions for reform and recovery packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
3.  **Increasing complexity of managing policy issues:** Encouraging a culture of innovation as a central part of public administration functioning at all levels of governance is vital for "super wicked problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>.
4.  **Impact and importance of the green transition:** Administrations need to ensure leadership competence, a sound knowledge base, accountability, and transparency to achieve climate neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.
5.  **Increase in competition for limited public funding:** Prioritization, leadership, innovative thinking, and improved financial management are key to addressing intergenerational fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>.

Building [[resilience_and_agility_in_government | resilience]] in public administrations is the primary challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>. This resilience stems from stable and efficient processes delivering quality services, combined with a capacity for disruption to challenge, innovate, adapt, and improve public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Anticipatory innovation capacity and the courage to challenge the status quo are vital for democratic societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>.

## Defining Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG)

The AIG model focuses on creating knowledge about the future and making decisions based on that knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. It means taking action today towards potential future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>. This requires a governance system that supports such action and includes:
*   **Agency in governments:** The ability to use different tools and methods, make sense of the future, explore alternatives, and develop organizational capabilities to translate this into innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
*   **Authorizing environment:** A feedback system that validates this work, evaluates policies for future resonance, stress tests them, ensures legitimacy, and fosters dialogue with citizens about desired futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>.

The assessment in Finland looked at both the agency of public servants and their authorizing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. Challenges identified included organizational, individual, and procedural hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.

Thematic issues analyzed in Finland include:
*   Making anticipation more democratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.
*   Integrating futures and foresight into budget and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>.
*   Exploring alternatives and required individual/organizational capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.
*   Crossing policy cycles to ensure continuity of important development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>.
*   Cross-government coordination to tackle silos and new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.

Pilots conducted in Finland focused on continuous learning, carbon neutrality, child well-being, and dialogues between politicians and administrative staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>.

## Integrating AIG into Government Functions

Anticipatory innovation functions should be included in existing government functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>:
*   Planning strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>.
*   Budgetary decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:23">[01:07:23]</a>.
*   Legislation and legal acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>.
*   Human resource functions, skills, and capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>.

New government functions are also needed, such as a **government transition function** to ensure continuity of complex policies across different government terms and prevent loss of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>. Planning functions need to become more transparent in analyzing and assigning responsibility for new emerging topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>.

Key action points for governments include:
*   Systemizing the transition process for long-term reform continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>.
*   Developing methods to plan responses to emerging issues, ensuring responsibility and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.
*   Establishing structures for regular collective sense-making, visioning, and exploration of alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
*   Testing new approaches to allocate resources to emerging phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   Integrating future-oriented data into fiscal planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.
*   Regulatory approaches to support experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.
*   Designing training and roles for anticipation in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   Institutionalizing dialogue and deliberation to build trust between citizens, public officials, and politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>.
*   Connecting futures and foresight systems to the policy-making system to ensure a value chain of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>.
*   Tracking and assessing the use of anticipatory approaches to understand what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.

## International Relevance and Collaboration

The challenges faced by governments are similar across countries, making shared solutions valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. While Finland is advanced, other countries like Norway and Portugal are also working on similar initiatives.

### Norway's Initiatives
Norway, sharing similarities with Finland, is exploring and applying anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Initiatives include:
*   Developing foresight websites and sharing cases and good examples to build capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.
*   Norwegian Defence Research Establishment carrying out assignments on information influence on elections, presenting scenarios to strengthen resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:49">[01:54:49]</a>.
*   A 2019 white paper on innovation in the public sector developed public sector scenarios for 2040 to make innovation policies future-fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:29">[01:55:29]</a>.
*   Using foresight methods in the Seamless Services Program to ensure new services meet future user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:31">[01:56:31]</a>.
*   Projects like "Starting and running a military organization" using scenario planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:10">[01:57:10]</a>.

### Portugal's Initiatives
Portugal has established PlanAPP, a new competence center at the core of government, focusing on planning, foresight, public policy monetization, and policy evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>. This entity is part of a broader European trend to prioritize foresight and anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:04">[01:48:04]</a>. Key initiatives include:
*   The agency for modernization of public administration (LabX) developed an anticipatory innovation starter kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:56">[01:57:56]</a>.
*   During its 2021 EU Council presidency, Portugal launched the "Ministries of the Future" initiative and the European Union's foresight network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:53">[01:59:53]</a>.
*   Different ministries (agriculture, infrastructure, economy, finance) have entities in charge of strategic thinking and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:47">[01:59:47]</a>.
*   PlanAPP aims to unlock existing capacities across the Portuguese public administration, sharing information and opening avenues for anticipatory work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:31">[02:00:31]</a>.
*   A critical work is regaining competencies and skills in the public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:56">[02:01:56]</a>.
*   The "2050 Lab" project is a participatory visioning initiative involving civil society and citizens to imagine Portugal's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:46">[02:02:46]</a>.

### Netherlands' Perspective
The Netherlands, being an open country, is accustomed to broad policy discussions with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:54">[01:43:54]</a>. While not yet as structured as Finland's AIG model, similar approaches are being tried in smaller projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:11">[01:44:11]</a>. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management is working on numerous issues, including artificial intelligence, well-being economics, hyperloops, flying cars, data science, and digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:03">[01:51:03]</a>. A key challenge is translating innovations into policy, as public servants are often risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:46">[01:51:46]</a>. Changing the philosophy of public organizations to embrace innovation and discard unsustainable practices is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:45">[01:52:45]</a>. Long-term funding for infrastructure projects helps maintain agenda focus, but funding new innovations is harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>.

## Building a Culture of Anticipation and Trust

The demand for anticipatory work stems from the recognition that current reactive approaches are too resource-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:25">[02:15:25]</a>. Bringing together different communities (innovation, steering systems, open government, civil servant capabilities) creates a core strength and shared demand for anticipatory governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:06">[02:16:06]</a>.

Citizen participation is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:04">[02:17:04]</a>. While citizens are generally involved in current issues, their involvement in future-oriented, anticipatory issues is less common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:44">[02:17:44]</a>. Engaging citizens throughout the policy cycle on future issues is essential for building trust and [[resilience_and_agility_in_government | resilience]] in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Proactively trying to make the future better for citizens builds confidence and trust, moving beyond just reacting to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:19">[02:19:19]</a>. Research shows that citizen trust in government's ability to innovate is directly linked to their overall trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:59">[02:26:59]</a>.

Equipping civil servants with tools and methods for future-oriented innovation and experimentation is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:01">[02:27:01]</a>. This includes providing toolkits and fostering a culture that promotes and integrates foresight and innovation into daily practice, moving beyond mere legal compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:44">[02:28:44]</a>. Capacity building, reinforcing skills, and building a community/network for information sharing are critical for these efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:19">[02:30:19]</a>.

Anticipatory innovation approaches are not just "nice to have" but are critical for how governments work and deliver in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:05">[02:30:05]</a>. Finland's blueprint provides a valuable example of adjusting government functioning and rethinking governance structures to support this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:39">[02:30:39]</a>. The experience gained will be shared with other countries, informing upcoming projects in places like Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Sweden, Flanders, and Belgium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:14">[02:31:14]</a>.

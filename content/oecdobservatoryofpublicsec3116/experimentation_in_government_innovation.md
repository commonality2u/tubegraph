Governments engage in [[innovation in government | innovation]] for various reasons, sometimes with a clear problem to solve and other times for the inherent value of exploration and development of capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This latter approach often involves significant [[Experimentation and Policy Prototyping | experimentation]].

## Reasons for Experimentation

Experimentation in government serves several crucial purposes:

### Discovering the Unknown
While some [[innovation in government | innovation]] is directed at specific challenges like cleaning oceans or addressing homelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, governments also innovate simply to "explore new things" and "new ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The nature of [[innovation in government | innovation]] is its uncertainty; it's impossible to predict where the next significant breakthrough will originate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Therefore, allowing individuals to explore novel concepts is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. In the private sector, this is termed "entrepreneurial discovery," where transformative ideas often emerge from those given the freedom to "play around and explore new thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This exploratory approach should also be fostered within the public sector to revamp and improve public services and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Building Innovation Capacity
Civil servants and public sectors need to innovate to develop the very ability to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>. Innovators are not born but learn to explore new ideas and think differently by actively engaging in these processes, known as "learning by doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Providing a "license to explore," "experiment with new ideas," and "apply them in practice" is essential to build this capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This ensures that when major challenges arise, there are individuals with the capacity to develop projects and solve problems in novel ways because they have prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

### Staying Current and Competitive
Governments also innovate to avoid being left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. If neighboring countries are innovating, a government may follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Unexplored options represent a cost, meaning it's necessary to explore various possibilities to remain relevant and prepared for future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. This mirrors the private sector, where companies like Apple and Sony constantly explore different ideas and solutions, not necessarily for immediate application, but because these might become significant in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## Examples of Experimentation Programs

Several governments have recognized the importance of [[Experimentation and Policy Prototyping | experimentation]]:

*   **Finland** has implemented a new program focused on [[Experimentation and Policy Prototyping | experimentation]] at the central government level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Canada** has an "experimentation directive" in action, allowing different government departments to [[Experimentation and Policy Prototyping | experiment]] with various policy ideas to assess their feasibility before wide-scale implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

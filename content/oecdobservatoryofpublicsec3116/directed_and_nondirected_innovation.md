Innovation is fundamentally influenced by two key variables: the clarity of its purpose and the degree of uncertainty involved in its process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These variables help define different facets of innovation, particularly within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Key Variables of Innovation

The two primary variables for defining innovation are:

1.  **Direction (or lack thereof)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:
    *   **Directed Innovation**: Occurs when there's a clear mandate or specific problem to solve, such as homelessness, poverty, or climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This means innovating towards a defined purpose or goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
    *   **Nondirected Innovation**: Involves exploring and adapting to new situations, often arising from people's natural creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It lacks a clear initial direction and focuses on emergent ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

2.  **Uncertainty (Radical vs. Incremental)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>:
    *   This variable relates to how uncertain the innovation process is, or whether risks can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
    *   It can also be described as a spectrum between "exploration" and "exploitation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
        *   **Exploitation**: Utilizes existing ideas and applies them in new contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
        *   **Exploration**: Focuses on creating entirely new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

These two angles—direction (or lack thereof) and the level of uncertainty—lead to different types of public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Types of Public Sector Innovation

Depending on the combination of direction and uncertainty, four key areas of public sector innovation emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>:

1.  **[[definition_of_mission_oriented_innovation | Mission oriented innovation]]**:
    *   Characterized by a directed, purpose-driven activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
    *   This concept, notably explored by Mariana Mazzucato at UCL, focuses on solving significant societal missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

2.  **[[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]]**:
    *   Involves exploration where there is no clear direction for where the innovation is headed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   Innovators explore new ideas through daily practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

3.  **Anticipatory innovation**:
    *   Emerged when the situation involves deep uncertainty and the exploration of new ideas leading to radical transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   It anticipates future transformations and involves working on ideas that can be quite radical to existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

4.  **[[enhancementoriented_innovation | Enhancementoriented innovation]]**:
    *   Focuses on improving or enhancing systems that are already in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

These four types of innovation each require different strategic approaches, capacities, and levels of allowance within government to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

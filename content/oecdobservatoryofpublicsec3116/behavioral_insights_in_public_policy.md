[[behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | Behavioral insights]] are presented as a tool to enhance public sector effectiveness and efficiency by understanding human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:33">[03:57:33]</a>. The OECD's Observatory for Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) leads work on this topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:32">[05:51:32]</a>.

## Why Behavioral Science in Policy Making?
Most public policies involve human behavior, as seen with preventative measures during a pandemic like hand washing or vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:54">[03:59:54]</a>. People are systematically biased and often irrational when making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:54">[03:59:54]</a>. Policy makers often assume an unrealistic model of human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:54">[03:59:54]</a>. The goal of embedding [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science in policy making]] is to improve public policy by leveraging this evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:54">[03:59:54]</a>.

Traditional government policy tools, such as providing information, implementing regulations, and offering incentives (financial or non-financial), are often insufficient to change people's behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:54">[03:59:54]</a>. [[implementing_behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | Implementing behavioral insights in public policy]] can enhance the effectiveness of these traditional tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:54">[03:59:54]</a>.

## Case Studies and [[impact_of_insights_on_public_policy | Impact of Insights on Public Policy]]

### UK Tax Collection
The UK's Behavioral Insights Team helped the tax agency collect an extra Â£200 million in tax debt in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:54">[03:59:54]</a>. This was achieved by adding a single sentence to an existing letter: "Nine out of ten people paid their tax on time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:54">[03:59:54]</a>. This simple intervention leveraged "social proof" and significantly increased the percentage of taxpayers paying on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:54">[03:59:54]</a>. Similar results were found in Guatemala, where the difference between the best and worst performing letters, when rolled out nationally, resulted in over $300,000 USD in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:40">[04:08:40]</a>.

### Australian Hospital Appointments
A project in Australia aimed to save hospitals money by reducing the number of missed specialist appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:40">[04:08:40]</a>. Patients received a simple reminder letter, and one group also received a map to help them find the clinic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:40">[04:08:40]</a>. Patients who received the reminder letter were 32% less likely to miss their appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:40">[04:08:40]</a>. If scaled, this could represent annual savings of $1.60 million and prevent over 9,000 non-attendances per year, showing a 9:1 return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:40">[04:08:40]</a>.

## Return on Investment
[[behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science in policy making]] allows for the computation of an impact-to-cost ratio, especially when trials are conducted using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:40">[04:08:40]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE] Return on Investment for Vaccination Policy
A comparison between an educational campaign and a simple prompt to employees for vaccination showed significant differences:
*   **Educational Campaign:** Less than one additional person vaccinated per $100 spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:40">[04:08:40]</a>.
*   **Prompt:** More than 12 additional people vaccinated per $100 spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:40">[04:08:40]</a>.

## Limitations and Challenges
Despite the proven effectiveness, there are limitations to adopting [[behavioral insights and their application in public integrity | behavioral insights and their application in public integrity]]:
*   **Scaling Up:** Experiments are often not scaled up into full implementation, even with amazing effect sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:40">[04:08:40]</a>. Factors influencing scaling include external validity (does it work in a bigger setting?), diminishing returns, and insufficient investment in scaling up successful innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:40">[04:08:40]</a>.
*   **Subtraction Bias:** There is a human tendency to always think of adding elements to a system, rather than subtracting things that don't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:57">[04:54:57]</a>. This leads to underestimating the power of removing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:57">[04:54:57]</a>.
*   **Status Quo Bias:** Once a service is established, challenging the status quo or subtracting elements becomes very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:57">[04:54:57]</a>.
*   **Backfiring Effects:** A positive behavior encouraged in one setting might reduce positive behavior in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:40">[04:08:40]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Gaps:** There is a lack of understanding and knowledge of [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights]] and their principles, especially among senior executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>.
*   **Resource and Tool Scarcity:** Governments often lack sufficient resources and instruments for implementing [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Alignment:** Initiatives are not always well-aligned with end-users and decision-makers, which is crucial for successful implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>.
*   **Transparency of Failures:** There is a need to share what *didn't* work in experiments (e.g., 40% of interventions at Beta don't work), which would be useful for others in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:04">[04:47:04]</a>.

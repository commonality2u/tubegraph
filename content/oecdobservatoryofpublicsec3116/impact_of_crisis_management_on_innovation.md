The COVID-19 crisis has significantly impacted public sector innovation, demonstrating the sector's capacity to innovate when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44">[09:44]</a>. The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) tracks over 400 innovative initiatives and case studies related to government responses to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51">[09:51]</a>, highlighting the surge in [[innovation_in_response_to_crisis | innovation in response to crisis]].

A key question is how organizations can sustain innovation when the need is less obvious, ensuring it becomes standard practice to be prepared for the unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04">[10:04]</a>.

## IP Australia's Experience with Crisis and Innovation

IP Australia, the Australian government agency responsible for intellectual property rights, provides an example of how prior investment in an innovative culture can aid [[resilience_and_innovation_in_pandemic_response | resilience and innovation in pandemic response]].

### Pre-Crisis Preparations
IP Australia's established culture of innovation, championed by its leadership and involving deliberate investment, put it in a strong position to respond to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54">[08:54]</a>. Key elements that contributed to their readiness included:

*   **Activity-Based Working (ABW) and IT Rollout**
    *   Prior to COVID-19, IP Australia had implemented activity-based working spaces in their office, allowing staff to choose environments suited to their tasks, from patent examination to agile scrum activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:15">[38:15]</a>.
    *   This was supported by an IT rollout ensuring all staff had laptops, good Wi-Fi, and audio-visual equipment for virtual meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:20">[39:20]</a>.
*   **Flexible Workplace Arrangements**
    *   The agency had already adopted highly flexible workplace arrangements, allowing staff to work remotely from almost anywhere with connectivity, provided it suited the activity and business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40">[39:40]</a>.
*   **Cultural Investment**
    *   Alongside infrastructure and policies, significant investment was made in cultural change, encouraging managers to embrace the opportunities of the new physical infrastructure and not insist on seeing staff physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46">[40:46]</a>.
    *   A strong change management process accompanied this physical transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:23">[41:23]</a>.
*   **Business Continuity Planning**
    *   Following the H1N1 event years prior, the Australian government developed a National Pandemic Plan, which IP Australia integrated into its business continuity process and updated annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:07">[44:07]</a>.
    *   Fortuitously, the agency had conducted a pandemic exercise trial run shortly before the COVID-19 outbreak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57">[44:57]</a>.

### Response to the COVID-19 Crisis
The groundwork laid by IP Australia's innovation journey proved invaluable when the crisis hit:

*   **Rapid Transition to Remote Work**
    *   The organization scaled from approximately 100 people working remotely daily to 1,000 staff working remotely in just one week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:54">[41:54]</a>.
    *   This rapid transition was possible because staff were already accustomed to virtual teams and managers were experienced in managing remote teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:21">[42:21]</a>.

### Lessons Learned for an Uncertain Future
The pandemic reinforced key insights for IP Australia regarding engaging with an unpredictable future:

*   **Confidence in Adaptability**
    *   The crisis instilled confidence within the organization that it can adapt and innovate effectively even under extreme pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:45">[43:45]</a>.
*   **Importance of Scenario Planning**
    *   The success of the long-standing National Pandemic Plan highlights the importance for all agencies to engage in scenario planning and strategic risk management, being less dismissive of unlikely catastrophic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:16">[45:16]</a>.
*   **Risk and Innovation are Hand-in-Hand**
    *   [[Role of Leadership in Innovation | Leadership]] must be prepared to accept and manage risks, dedicating resources (even a small percentage of the budget) to experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30">[30:30]</a>.
    *   The agency's existing [[role_of_leadership_in_fostering_innovation | appetite for risk]] and agile methodologies facilitated quick identification of issues and collaboration across internal teams, customers, and external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06">[31:06]</a>.

> [!TIP] **Connecting Innovation and Risk**
> [[Challenges and opportunities of public sector innovation in a crisis | Innovation]] and risk are intrinsically linked, and fostering a culture that understands and manages risk is crucial for innovation to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:05">[46:05]</a>.

Ultimately, the [[impact_of_covid19_on_global_innovation | impact of COVID-19 on global innovation]] underscored the value of IP Australia's proactive strategic choices, which allowed them to navigate significant unexpected change effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:55">[42:55]</a>.

Civil society plays a crucial role in crisis management, often demonstrating high agility and innovation in responding to urgent needs and ensuring citizen voices are heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.

## Increased Engagement and Challenges

While there has been an observed increase in [[engagement_with_civil_society | engagement with citizens]] at various levels, which is seen as positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, challenges remain. Restrictions on freedom introduced during crises, such as the pandemic, have hindered [[engagement_with_civil_society | citizen participation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Issues like censorship and restricted access to information can undermine government accountability and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

## Civil Society's Contributions

Civil society groups and community-based organizations (CBOs) have showcased several key contributions during crises:

*   **Rapid Response and Humanitarian Support**
    They are often fast to respond, providing humanitarian emergency support globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>. This includes reaching the most vulnerable in communities, addressing issues for marginalized populations that governments might overlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. An example is the distribution of food to single mothers in isolated districts of Casablanca and Marrakesh, Morocco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.
*   **Combating Misinformation**
    Civil society acts as a safeguard against misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. They find new ways to campaign, raise awareness, and reach communities and citizens through [[innovation_in_response_to_crisis | innovative]] means, including art forms like graffiti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. Engaging citizens and building trust with civil society are crucial for counteracting misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   **Accountability and Transparency Monitoring**
    They engage in front-line monitoring of accountability and transparency, observing the distribution of food, services, and equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>. They also demand more visibility regarding foreign funding from institutions like the World Bank and IMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.
*   **Digital and Offline Engagement**
    [[innovation_in_response_to_crisis | Innovation]] in civil society engagement depends on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>. They engage more in digital spaces and customize how people engage in virtual environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. Despite the digital shift, the power of community-based organizations close to people is essential for true inclusion, especially given limitations of virtual spaces and unequal access to infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. Strategies include:
    *   Creating local champions or using existing activists and communities to bring voices from those who cannot access virtual spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
    *   Developing "offline discussions" innovations, drawing from technologies used in extreme environments with internet shutdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
    *   Adopting a hybrid approach to inclusion, being mindful of the intersectionality of inclusion, considering categories like women, youth, elders, and people in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.
*   **Demanding and Driving Change**
    Civil society and communities do not stop their work even when [[engagement_with_civil_society | civic spaces]] are restricted, continuously helping governments respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Their engagement is driven by the desire to see tangible impact and change on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

## Fostering Sustainable Partnerships

For future resilience and effective [[role_of_government_in_crisis_management | government]] response, it is crucial to foster more significant partnerships and collaboration with civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. Moving from a "market approach" where citizens are viewed as clients to a "constituents relations" model is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:17">[01:05:17]</a>. This means viewing citizens as the source of legitimacy and building trust, rather than just implementing tools or [[innovation_in_response_to_crisis | innovations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>.

The sustainability of crisis responses relies on inclusion, ensuring everyone impacted is part of the decision-making cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. This "radical partnership" involves bringing vulnerable populations into the co-design of solutions and services, moving beyond mere service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>.

> [Mona Benara] "We have to be more radical about [[engagement_with_civil_society | civic space]] and fundamental freedoms... people have the right to express and we are here to be more um you know in the front to defend um our freedoms and our [[engagement_with_civil_society | engagement]] and also our place at Citizen and uh and as organization in the table to talk about these [[challenges_and_opportunities_of_public_sector_innovation_in_a_crisis | challenges]]."

Participatory processes and governance focus on **co-creation** with stakeholders to develop policies, services, and better futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The aim is to achieve more robust solutions and greater support for decisions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Defining Co-creation

Co-creation involves stakeholders in identifying all dimensions of a problem or issue, and in designing and implementing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This is achieved through a generative exchange of insights and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. It encompasses:
*   Co-designing policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   Co-constructing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   Co-experiencing and improving what has been co-created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>

### Co-creation vs. Consultation
Co-creation is distinctly different from simply informing (announcing decisions) or traditional consultation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Consultation often involves online surveys asking for comments on a draft policy, which can result in a series of controversial monologues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. In contrast, co-creation emphasizes a "generative exchange" where people actively "get together in some way, online or offline, and talk and brush off their ideas and align around their path forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Benefits and Purpose of Co-creation

*   **Robust Solutions & Support**: Leads to more robust solutions and greater support for decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Addressing Complexity**: It's the only way to effectively deal with complex systems, as no central authority can fully understand and control them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Building Legitimacy**: Provides a way to construct legitimacy when deviating from traditional policymaking processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   **Distributed Learning**: Fosters a learning capacity within the system, where all partners engage in distributed learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.
*   **Effective Implementation**: While initially time-consuming, the public acceptance and buy-in gained through participatory processes make implementation much more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Knowledge & Competence Transfer**: Provides knowledge and builds employee competences for different ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Stronger Innovation Culture**: Strengthens innovation culture, especially in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Protection Against Lobbyists**: Open processes protect against lobbyists by ensuring transparency and preventing secret deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.

## Key Enablers and Success Factors

Several factors contribute to successful co-creation:
*   **Political Backing and Clear Purpose**: Political backing and momentum are crucial for a clear purpose, focusing on the problem to solve rather than a predefined outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. Project sponsors need a mandate and commitment to [[impact_and_accountability_in_participatory_processes | implement solutions]] in a co-creative manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Teams**: An advanced secretariat is needed to manage content, alongside a high-powered hosting team to manage the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
*   **Learning and Authenticity**: Co-creation offers tremendous learning for participants and administration. Authenticity is key: "you say what you mean and you mean what you say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.
*   **Mindset and Openness**: A shift in mindset towards openness to new ideas and views is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.
*   **Addressing Complexity Systemically**: Recognizing that problems have no institutional boundaries and require a systemic view and holistic solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>. The importance of sharing diverse views, findings, knowledge, and experience increases with complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.
*   **Skilled and Motivated People**: People are central; skilled and motivated individuals are key to inclusive solutions and a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. This involves building and strengthening connections and support networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   **Staff Capacity**: Staff should be skilled in project management, receive regular training, have autonomy to act, and be willing to grant discretion to external stakeholders and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. The ability to "hold space" is a different skill, requiring emotional intelligence and social presence, which may necessitate different recruitment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.
*   **Institutional Buy-in and Strategic Intent**: Strategic buy-in from senior leadership (Director Generals, politicians) is needed to recognize the importance of co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. This also implies an awareness of the limits of conventional policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Openness**: Working out loud, with transparent processes and open documentation of learnings and reflections, is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. This ensures accountability and allows for challenge from various formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:59">[01:04:59]</a>.
*   **Citizen Inclusion**: Proactive efforts to recruit participants from diverse demographic profiles are necessary to ensure true representation, as seen in the Antwerp participatory budgeting example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.
*   **Iterative Processes**: Especially in crises, policy-making needs to be agile and iterative, where large-scale changes are made but can be adjusted weekly based on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

## Challenges and Pitfalls

*   **Hierarchical Mindset**: A significant barrier to engaging more stakeholders is a hierarchical mindset within governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.
*   **Lack of Knowledge and Skills**: Insufficient participatory knowledge, skills, and tools hinder effective co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.
*   **Time Consumption**: Co-creation is initially time-consuming, as participatory processes take the time they need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Practices**: Public administration may struggle to host collaboration if its internal practices are not collaborative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   **Lack of Transparency**: Without transparency about how results will be used, trust can be compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.
*   **Rigid Frameworks**: Rigid regulative frameworks, inflexible procurement procedures, and national legislation can impede experimentation and create an unfavorable climate for co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.
*   **Central Control Assumption**: The belief that a central authority can understand and control a complex system leads to an informational problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.
*   **Exclusion of Future Generations**: Current co-creation often fails to involve future generations, who will bear significant impacts from present decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
*   **"Truth Engine" Mindset**: Science is often mistakenly reduced to a "truth engine" rather than a method for holding uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.
*   **Incumbent Bias**: A risk exists if bureaucrats interpret and translate participant input, potentially losing trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. Public officials should provoke challenge to ensure public interest is considered, even if it diverges from community interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### Circular Plastics Alliance (European Commission)
The European Commission has engaged in participatory processes for over a decade, including co-creation with stakeholders and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. The Circular Plastics Alliance aimed to recycle 10 million tons of used plastic into new products annually by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This complex problem involved numerous actors across the value chain, from chemical producers to recyclers, as well as public authorities and regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Instead of legislating, the Commission fostered an alliance by inviting value chain members to join and build it, starting with CEOs of main industry and consumer groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Fully participatory working group meetings (14 of them in spring/summer 2019) led to a declaration with 120 signatories by September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Meetings were designed individually, using classic methods like World Cafe and Open Space Technology, and new methods developed for specific settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This process focused on building trust and generative exchange, where opinions were "grind[ed] against each other" to create solutions collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### Innovative.si (Slovenian Ministry of Public Administration)
The Innovative.si project focuses on creatively resolving complex social challenges and building employee competencies for new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Its vision is to strengthen an innovation culture within [[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | public administration]], particularly in Slovenia where top-down approaches are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. The project matches public sector challenges requiring co-creation with internal or external facilitators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. A key element is the active involvement of users from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. The project established an "innovation community platform" for networking, learning, support, and transferring good practices, growing to over 400 members from public, private, and academic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. Innovation ambassadors, individuals who actively participate in the community and their own work environment, serve as entry points in institutions and promote co-creative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

### Cogo Digital Toolkit
This toolkit, developed by an international consortium, aims to provide holistic support to public organizations in implementing co-creation, focusing on the service level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. It comprises four tools:
1.  **Koredi**: Assesses an organization's readiness to co-create through a self-evaluation questionnaire, providing an assessment score and a roadmap for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. It allows comparison with other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
2.  **Coserv**: Helps identify which public service is most suitable for renewal based on co-creation, also using a questionnaire and providing a comparative view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
3.  **Cornew**: Actively includes service users in the service renewal process, building on the concept of user journey mapping to gather problems and suggestions for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
4.  **Comaster**: Assesses the quality of co-creation that took place during service renewal, helping identify areas for future improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

### Other Examples
*   **Mind Shift Community (Sweden)**: A community built to address mental health, recognizing it as a multi-actor problem (schools, workplaces, neighborhoods) that no single agency could solve alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. It fostered awareness of interdependencies among actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.
*   **Participatory Budgeting in Antwerp**: The central municipality allocated 10% of its budget to a participatory process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>. To counter the typical demographic bias of volunteers, they actively recruited participants from immigrant communities, less educated citizens, and impoverished citizens by going to sports centers and supermarkets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.
*   **Bank of England**: Is [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | co-creating]] policy and bringing citizens into the conversation, suggesting a trend towards [[inclusive_and_accessible_democratic_participation | citizen juries and citizen assemblies]] as key deliberative frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.

## Impact of Crises on Governance

Crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, highlight that traditional policymaking processes are not fast or agile enough to deal with "long emergencies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. Governments have been forced to adopt a "parametric capacity of policy," acting by implementing policy, observing data, and changing course iteratively, essentially running large-scale experiments continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. This requires a fundamentally different "rewiring of government" and a different way to communicate and participate with the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>. While this opens up a new policy architecture, it raises questions about how to construct legitimacy when policy-making becomes an iterative process rather than solely residing in parliamentary acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

The European Commission, for example, faces structural challenges due to two-year budget planning cycles, which conflict with the need for agile, flexible, and iterative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>. This requires a fundamental reflection on how to structure public budget making to allow for agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.

## Future of Governance

The discussion suggests a need for a "structural reboot of our institutional frameworks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a> to enable societies to make decisions together in a complex and emerging world, especially given current challenges like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. This transformation involves:
*   **Institutionalizing "Care"**: Designing institutions that "care," meaning they are open, deal with open-ended questions and outcomes, and recognize the critical role of others in delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.
*   **[[citizencentered_governance_and_engagement | Citizen-Centered Approach]]**: Recognizing that "stakeholders are citizens" and integrating citizens into policy-making processes, possibly through citizen juries and assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning**: Fostering [[emerging_technologies_in_governance | authentic learning communities]] that continuously work on skills and knowledge, maintaining motivation and connection among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.
*   **Political Role Shift**: Politicians need to shift from providing all answers to holding space and ensuring the integrity of the co-creation process, embarking on a learning journey with the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
*   **[[unilateral_and_multilateral_approaches_in_governance | Multilevel Governance]]**: Collaboration and interconnectedness are crucial across different levels and sectors, from local to international initiatives, for co-creation to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has been identified as a systemic shock, revealing existing vulnerabilities and requiring fundamental changes in governance and policy approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Experts suggest that radical reforms are essential to address the prevailing policy directions that were in place before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The crisis has demonstrated the necessity for governments to systematically change their policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Why [[Complexity and Systems Thinking in Governance]] is Crucial

The COVID-19 crisis is not merely a crisis of the virus itself, but rather a crisis that emerged from the virus exploiting a flawed system of public governance that was not aligned with its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. This highlights the need to understand crises as symptoms of deeper underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. In periods of profound change, established worldviews lose their capacity to explain the world, making it difficult for new, more adapted worldviews to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Crises can accelerate this shift from one worldview to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

The vulnerabilities exposed by the pandemic are seen as a testament to the growing inadequacy of the worldview that shaped current systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. The pandemic hasn't necessarily changed global long-term trends but has brutally accelerated them, signifying an ongoing paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. For governance systems to show resilience and navigate this deep change, they must create circumstances that allow change to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. This involves making complex issues intuitive and quickly identifying key leverage points to help systems adapt to new conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

Underlying issues such as inequality have been highlighted by the crisis. For example, COVID-19 prevalence in Helsinki aligned with areas of high unemployment and immigrant populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. In the U.S., racial disparities in death rates showed black individuals were twice as likely to die from COVID-19 than white individuals, suggesting an inextricable link between COVID-19 and issues like Black Lives Matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. Addressing these precise entry points can lead to action on broader systemic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

## [[Systemic approaches during Covid19 crisis]]: Tools and Examples

Several organizations have explored and implemented [[strategic_decisionmaking_in_complex_systems | systemic approaches]] in response to the crisis:

### European Commission's EU Policy Lab
The EU Policy Lab, part of the European Commission, has developed a tool called the "Complex System Analyzer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This two-day workshop aims to help identify leverage points within complex systems and connect them to a future vision aligned with a more sustainable worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. It's available as a Creative Commons resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. The European Commission has taken a stance to leverage the crisis as an opportunity for a serious sustainable transition, linking it to the EU Green Deal and digital and green transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

### UK Cabinet Office's Policy Lab
The UK Policy Lab has developed a "Government as a System" toolkit, which explores how government might work more systemically across individual, collective, and governmental actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. This toolkit demystifies the role of government in crises, categorizing actions from formal powers (legislate, regulate, fund) to softer powers (collaborate, enable, advise, role model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. The toolkit has been expanded to 56 actions to map local, regional, national, and [[international_collaboration_in_crisis_management | international government action]] to address large systemic challenges across jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. The lab also focuses on bringing together diverse expertise, including external experts and insights from lived experience through remote anthropological and ethnographic methods, alongside Big Data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

### Lessons from National Responses
*   **Vietnam**: With nearly 100 million people, Vietnam recorded zero COVID-19 deaths and 350 cases, demonstrating nimbleness, smart procurement shifts, and dynamic integration of culture and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. This success suggests that countries with existing underlying systems of governance, accustomed to regular crises (like SARS or natural disasters), have a practiced "muscle" for response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.
*   **Finland**: Despite being a "good pupil" in public governance, Finland's experience highlighted failures in its preparedness strategy. A 2008 pandemic preparedness plan hadn't been revisited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>, and strategic reserves of masks and ventilators had expired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. Furthermore, a lack of [[crossagency_collaboration_in_crisis_management | integrated work]] among four different agencies at Helsinki Airport meant quarantine decrees didn't translate into effective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. This demonstrates that a linear, industrial way of thinking about preparedness left them unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.

### The Netherlands' Crisis Lab and Regulatory Reform
The Crisis Lab in the Netherlands suggests that a path forward might involve "less of government," particularly in traditional inspection and regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. Observations show that halting inspections during the crisis did not lead to societal collapse, suggesting that much regulation is not outcome-based or useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.

A proposed system change involves shifting responsibility for controlling, inspecting, and even detailing regulations from governments to actors within society, emphasizing legal liability and mandatory insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. Examples include:
*   **France's building system**: Instead of elaborate government checks, builders must show they are insured, leaving inspection to insurance companies that prioritize effective safety measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.
*   **Dutch dangerous goods transport**: A legal liability of 10 million euros and mandatory insurance for transporters drastically improved safety by incentivizing responsible behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.

## Challenges and [[Crisis management and future preparedness]]
Several significant challenges emerge for governments seeking to implement systemic approaches:

*   **Austerity and Budget Gaps**: Cities like Santa Monica and Helsinki face massive budget shortfalls due to dwindling tax revenues and rising costs, necessitating a shift from "cut to save" to "cut to invest" in new capabilities and the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
*   **Institutional Inertia**: There's a "greedy government" tendency to resist letting go of responsibilities and a deep distrust of society without extensive regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. Regulatory bodies and inspectors also resist budget cuts and staff reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. Public administrators can also experience fatigue, making it hard to maintain improvisation and dynamism in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.
*   **Political and Ideological Capture**: There is a risk that systems thinking can be misused for selfish or ideological ends, especially when decision-making teams lack diversity and represent only narrow interest groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. For example, Finland's exit strategy committee, composed of 79 people, included no individuals with immigrant backgrounds despite a significant immigrant population in Helsinki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.
*   **Lack of Learning Mechanisms**: Governments often lack structured real-time learning mechanisms, and may decline external offers of assistance during crises, missing opportunities to build new capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>.

### Recommendations for the Future
*   **Real-time Learning**: Establish "learning teams" within the core of government and on the frontlines to capture insights and systematize external offers of help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Mindset**: Embrace an adaptive mindset where problems and solutions emerge together, supported by granular research and new [[the_role_of_data_in_crisis_management_and_resilience_building | data sources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.
*   **Redesign Preparedness**: Re-imagine preparedness beyond linear, industrial thinking to account for dynamic, uncertain risks where probabilities are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.
*   **New Leadership Models**: Develop [[leadership_and_teamwork_in_crisis_management | leadership models]] not solely based on risks and probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>.
*   **Address Legacy Lock-ins**: Tackle the deeply embedded carbon-intensive economy and its ties to social inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.
*   **Creative Exit Strategies**: Develop socially engaged and creative exit strategies for crises, rather than relying on narrow groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.
*   **Shift in Governance**: Move towards a regenerative and restorative model of public services, focusing on "doing the right things" (allocative efficiency) over merely "doing things right" (technical efficiency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. This includes empowering society to find innovative solutions by trusting communities and ceding some government control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>.
*   **Invest in Austerity**: Proactively plan for austerity by cutting to invest in future capabilities, rather than just cutting to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>.

The period following the initial shock of the crisis presents a crucial "100-day window" where decisions about reverting to old ways or springing ahead are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>. The ultimate measure of success will be how much governments have learned from this experience and their ability to absorb and transform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>. The crisis is an opportunity for [[adapting_to_crisis_with_innovative_approaches | innovation]] for better, aiming to reform and rethink how government operates rather than just bouncing back to previous states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>.

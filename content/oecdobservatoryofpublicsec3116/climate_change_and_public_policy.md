Governments today are facing significant challenges due to the extraordinary pace and complexity of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It is increasingly clear that governments must adopt new and innovative approaches to tackle society's most pressing problems, which include [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation | climate change]], infectious diseases, and digital disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Driving Innovation in Government

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation is dedicated to embedding innovation at the core of government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Their work empowers public servants by providing new insights, tools, and connections, enabling them to explore novel possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Key activities include:
*   Conducting cutting-edge research to identify emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Collaborating with leading experts to offer trusted advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Transforming new ideas into standard practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

This work extends globally, reaching both OECD countries and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. While governments will undoubtedly face more challenges, collective action can help anticipate and address these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The aim is to support the development of superior and more innovative policies, contributing to better lives for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

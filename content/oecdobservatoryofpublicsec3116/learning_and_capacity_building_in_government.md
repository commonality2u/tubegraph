The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that the future is highly uncertain, revealing the fictional nature of stability and demonstrating that 20th-century governments, designed for predictable environments, cannot stand still <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The cost of late action or inaction can be terribly high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This new reality necessitates a shift in how governments operate, emphasizing [[Learning by doing and capacity building in public sector | learning and capacity building]] to navigate continuous fluidity and flux, rather than striving for a "new normal" that is, in fact, a "never normal" situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Embracing Uncertainty and a Learning Mindset

The challenges of our time, such as pandemics, are global, complex, and deeply systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Governments must be ready to embrace uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> and should aim to prepare, not just react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The idea of war is a mistaken metaphor for dealing with a virus, which is part of an ecology, requiring natural-based responses and acknowledging biological and moral interdependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Key to this is abandoning the idea of normality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a> and adopting new ways of operating. This involves:
*   Learning from new data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   Unlearning old assumptions that are limiting or flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   Finding new ways of operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

The sooner governments move into a [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | learning mindset]] rather than a pure doing or action-based mindset, the sooner they will thrive in new circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## Shifting from Performance to Capacity Management

Traditional government structures were built on a worldview of control, planning, and predictable answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. However, the COVID-19 crisis showed that nobody had the right answers initially, necessitating mutual [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This calls for a fundamental shift:
*   **From performance management to capacity management** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This means increasing the learning capacity of different public organizations to learn from one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Embracing emergent learning**, where "best" constantly changes, requiring continuous adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Adopting a system portfolio approach** with interconnected interventions that constantly learn from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

A key challenge for governments is to move beyond the need for a predefined script or a body of evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. While core values and vision can serve as lighthouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, governments should not be anchored by specific worldviews or mental models. Scenario planning is crucial to question assumptions and consider different versions of the future, even unpalatable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Finland has a long tradition of future work in government and parliament, which aided its pandemic response, but integration into core political discussion and decision-making remains a goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

## Building Capabilities for an Adaptive Government

To foster anticipatory governance, governments must:
*   **Look at joint missions and explore various scenarios** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.
*   **Cultivate a culture of [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | experimentation and learning]]** through shared portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **Improve the speed of data handling** to better understand complex adaptive systems in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.
*   **Utilize tools like risk-managed regulatory explorative work** (e.g., sandboxes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

The shift from performance to capacity management requires several mindset changes:
*   **From optimization to resilience**: Building ramp-up or spillover capacity rather than paring down resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **From quantitative to qualitative indicators**: Listening to ethnographic stories and qualitative data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **From output to outcomes**: Focusing on broader societal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
*   **From linear to exponential approaches**: Recognizing that small inputs can have profound non-linear effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **From scarcity to abundance/growth mindsets**: Allowing for continuous learning, change, and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
*   **From stable equilibrium to iterative work**: Constantly adjusting, experimenting, and prototyping for sustained improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   **From silo mindset to integration**: Allowing for local sub-optimization if it benefits the global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

## The Role of Leadership and Citizen Engagement

Leadership is critical in this transition, requiring the ability to hold opposing thoughts and balance different tensions simultaneously (e.g., present vs. future, micro vs. macro, slowing down vs. speeding up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. Leaders must celebrate [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | learning]], including negative results, as valuable for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.

To build trust and legitimize experimental approaches in the face of uncertainty, governments should:
*   **Involve citizens and stakeholders in co-creation**: People buy into what they help create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. This means acting as a facilitator and convener, bringing diverse interests together for deliberative dialogues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.
*   **Foster place-based processes**: Cities play a crucial role in co-creating priorities, visions, and prototypes that yield tangible results, connecting local, national, and international efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.
*   **Be transparent about uncertainty**: As seen in Finland, political leaders can build trust by openly stating that decisions may change as new evidence emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. Trust doesn't mean sticking to a single position, but rather being humble and decisive in the face of changing circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on internal motivation for behavioral change**: Beyond traditional methods of authority or rational persuasion, [[Learning by doing and capacity building in public sector | learning]] through experience helps citizens see how things can be done differently, leading to internal motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>.

Governments should pay special attention to the most vulnerable, ensuring their voices are heard and involved in addressing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. The crisis is an opportunity to accelerate transformation and shape a regenerative economy and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

[[Missionoriented innovation]] and cocreation are becoming central to public sector innovation, especially in addressing complex, long-term challenges. These approaches emphasize setting bold, future-ready goals and involving diverse stakeholders in their development and implementation.

## Defining Mission-Oriented Approaches

[[Missionoriented innovation]] involves defining broad, ambitious objective statements with a timeline, providing directionality and intentionality about where a society or organization wants to be in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. These missions are designed to be "future ready," allowing for rapid adaptation when conditions change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. They aim to avoid "lock-in" associated with setting goals for an uncertain future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation actively works on both anticipatory and [[missionoriented innovation]] approaches, having recently launched a [[MissionOriented Innovation | Missions Action Lab]] focused on proper implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

## The Role of Cocreation in Mission Setting

A basic principle of [[missionoriented innovation in public policy]] is that missions are [[Cocreation and stakeholder engagement in mission setting | co-created by different actors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This co-development is crucial for achieving shared objectives and commitments from all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Cocreation Methods

Various channels are used for the cocreation process:
*   **Formal processes and governance structures** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Japan, for instance, utilizes "visionary councils" for their Moonshot Goals, even including a science fiction novelist to open up future possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Online consultations, workshops, and deep dives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. These methods are seen in countries like the UK, Sweden, and other Nordic nations for co-creating missions and roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Citizen engagement and dialogue techniques** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. The European Commission, for example, gathered inputs from across the EU to understand citizen priorities during mission design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

### Benefits of Cocreation
Cocreation helps in:
*   Building consensus and strong agreement across policy areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   Ensuring buy-in and ownership from citizens and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   Connecting overarching targets and ambitions with practical implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   Fostering a learning mindset within partnerships, recognizing that plans will adapt over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## Practical Examples of Mission-Oriented Approaches and Cocreation

### European Commission
The European Commission's DG Research & Innovation launched five missions in September, with significant funding from the Horizon Europe program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. These missions are integrated across the EU's policy agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>:
*   Conquering Cancer (target: 3 million lives saved, living longer and better by 2030) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>
*   Climate Resilient Europe (target: prepare Europe for climate disruptions, accelerate transition to healthy, prosperous future by 2030) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[05:06:00]</a>
*   Starfish (restoring oceans and waters; target: clean marine/fresh waters, restore degraded ecosystems by 2030) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:16:00]</a>
*   100 Climate Neutral Cities by 2030 (support, promote, showcase systemic transformation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:27:00]</a>
*   Caring for Soil (target: at least 75% of EU soils healthy for food, people, nature, climate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:39:00]</a>

The development of these missions involved foresight, expertise from "mission boards," and a novel approach to listening to citizens' desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[06:22:00]</a>. The implementation plans clearly state that investments will come from beyond just Horizon Europe funding to ensure continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Denmark
Denmark is focusing its attention on [[missionoriented innovation]] in the green transition, aiming to be a frontrunner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[09:27:00]</a>. The Danish government's green research strategy (September 2020) highlights four specific green research and innovation missions:
*   Capture and storage or use of CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:50:00]</a>
*   Green fuels for transport and industry (e.g., Power2X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:55:00]</a>
*   Climate and environment-friendly agriculture and food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[10:02:00]</a>
*   Circular economy, focusing on plastics and textiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:06:00]</a>

These missions aim to contribute to a 70% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050, as well as increasing biodiversity and competitiveness of Danish industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:38:00]</a>. The success of these missions relies on a systemic development of technologies and solutions, considering the full value chain (technological, financial, regulatory roadmaps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:26:00]</a>. Partnerships involving companies, public administration, private investors, and researchers are crucial for [[Cocreation and stakeholder engagement in mission setting | co-creating roadmaps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

### Norway
Norway's digital strategy for the public sector prioritizes "seamless services for life events," which are major life occurrences (e.g., having children, starting a business) where navigating information and services can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:57:00]</a>. These represent "wicked problems" requiring cross-sectoral changes at a systemic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

The mission approach is being explored for challenges like "seriously ill children" and "starting/running a voluntary organization" because they require collective and targeted efforts from public, private, and voluntary sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This approach combines ambitious top-down goals with broad bottom-up efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Strategic foresight methods, including scenario planning and developing future personas, are used to future-proof these services and meet the needs of future users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Mission Washing
A significant danger in the mission space is "mission washing," where existing activities are rebranded as missions without a genuine commitment to changing how things are delivered or what innovations are pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

### Maintaining Flexibility and Agility
Governments need to implement flexible, agile, and iterative practices to ensure missions develop dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Developing governance models that allow for regular evaluation, international evaluation, and the ability to stop unsuccessful initiatives while financing new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   Adopting a learning mindset, accepting that initial plans will likely change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   Implementing "stage-gate" approaches and portfolio strategies, where missions are comprised of a portfolio of projects that are continually tuned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

### Dealing with Uncertainty and Failure
While missions aim for long-term goals, they operate in uncertain environments. It's crucial to be prepared for directions that deviate from the desired path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The term "failure" itself is complex; some aspects may not prosper, but the overall mission might still yield valuable insights or technologies. For example, previous moonshots, even if their direct goal wasn't fully met, led to unforeseen technological advancements like the internet or smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

Strategies for handling potential "failure" include:
*   Emphasizing a "culture of cooperation" where blame is not attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   Having an "exit strategy" that allows for discontinuation without killing all activity, repurposing efforts to reduce sunk costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   Ensuring that discussions around missions include those who might experience negative impacts (e.g., from changing industries), as well as those who benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### Intergenerational Fairness and Inclusivity
Missions, especially those with long-term impacts like climate change, need to consider intergenerational fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Designing processes for deep and effective participation, allowing "voice" for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   Tapping into the energy and perspective of young foresight practitioners who are transforming communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   Rethinking planning processes in government to be more participative and future-focused, potentially seeing SDGs as a national strategy for next generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   Integrating social science and humanities alongside technological solutions, as changing behavior and societal norms are crucial for successful implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

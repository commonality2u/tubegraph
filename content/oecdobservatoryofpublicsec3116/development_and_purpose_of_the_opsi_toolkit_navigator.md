The [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] is a public service project supported by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 program, developed by the full [[observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] team led by Angela Hansen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Its primary aim is to help public sector innovators find the right toolkits based on their specific needs, rather than creating yet another toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Background and Motivation

The initial task in 2017 was to build a toolkit for all public sector innovation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, the prevailing sentiment, articulated in a blog article, was that the world had reached "peak toolkit," with hundreds already available, creating more noise than signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. To address this, a workshop was held at the 2017 [[observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] conference with public sector leaders and civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This workshop aimed to understand their journey when trying something new, how they found information, who they reached out to, and what tools and methods they used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The insights gained about the daily struggles of public sector innovators were used to build the [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | Toolkit Navigator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

A guiding quote for the project was from Andrea Snook of UK Policy Lab: "Toolkits are like toothbrushes; everybody has one, but nobody wants to use someone else's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This highlighted the preference for creating new tools, which the navigator aims to incentivize through its design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Underlying Framework: [[observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]]'s Multifaceted Innovation Model

A key backdrop for the navigator's development is the [[observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] Multifaceted Innovation Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This model, derived from system-level studies of the governments of Canada and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, identifies different purposes of innovation in the public sector:
*   **Directed/Shaping (Top-down)**: Mission-oriented innovation, such as putting a person on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Undirected/Responding (Bottom-up)**: Innovation for innovation's sake, fostering entrepreneurial spirit without a known outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented (High Certainty)**: Improving existing processes and services for better efficiency, e.g., using behavioral insights to increase tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Exploration-oriented (Uncertain Spaces)**: Radical shifts, looking at how external and internal factors change the nature of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

These facets are supported by different methods, processes, disciplines, and domains of practice, as "methods matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The choice of methods biases outcomes; for instance, investing heavily in lean business process management may lead to more enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This underscores the importance of choosing methods according to one's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_findings_in_toolkit_usage | Challenges and Findings in Toolkit Usage]]

Research into existing toolkits and user experiences revealed several [[challenges_and_findings_in_toolkit_usage | challenges and findings in toolkit usage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>:
*   **Over-reliance on past tools**: Innovators tend to use what worked before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Misalignment with problems**: Toolkits are chosen based on popularity or familiarity rather than suitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Ignoring existing skills**: Some toolkits require advanced skills not always present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Granularity issues**: Toolkits can be either too specific or too broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Learned helplessness**: Polished toolkits can discourage adaptation, even when context demands it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Ideal Toolkit Characteristics and Organization

The research suggested that an ideal toolkit should be:
*   Adaptable and transferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
*   Approachable and user-centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>
*   Action-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
*   Modular, allowing users to combine parts from different toolkits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>

The [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] organizes its "compendium of toolkits" around "innovation tasks" or "jobs to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Beyond typical "problem-solving jobs" (e.g., discovery, prototyping), it includes:
*   **Group behavioral jobs**: Building consensus, challenging assumptions, cultivating mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Approach planning jobs**: Preliminary scoping and getting started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Contextualization jobs**: Understanding the dynamics of the working environment, visualizing systems, imagining futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

The navigator also categorizes toolkits by their level of granularity (e.g., methodology, tactic, playbook, manual) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, helping users find resources at the right level of abstraction for their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Hundreds of toolkits were analyzed and tagged with disciplines of practice, jobs to be done, included/excluded elements, and other meta-fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

## [[design_and_features_of_the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | Design and Features]]

Initial designs and several prototypes of the navigator were tested with public sector innovators and national government innovation leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Feedback, including 349 pieces from government leaders, significantly influenced the [[design_and_features_of_the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | design and features of the OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] to suit user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

Key principles guiding the [[design_and_features_of_the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | design and features of the OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] include:
*   **Building innovative capacity**: Special emphasis is placed on toolkits that are freely accessible and easy to adapt, modify, and remix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. This act of remixing builds capacity within teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Open Source Badges**: Toolkits receive badges based on their reusability:
    *   **Open Source Basic**: Allows for reuse (download, print) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Open Source Champion**: Licensed with Creative Commons for remixing and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
    *   **Heroes**: Provide editable files or code to facilitate remixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. These badges are visible on each toolkit page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Social Proof and Community**: Innovators seek social proof that new methods are safe and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. The navigator connects toolkits to:
    *   [[observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]]'s case study platform, featuring hundreds of government innovation cases with impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
    *   The [[observatory_of_public_sector_innovation | OPSI]] user base, with over 1700 members, allowing users to connect, discuss, review toolkits, and seek advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

## [[navigational_paths_for_innovation_tool_selection | Navigational Paths for Innovation Tool Selection]]

The [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] organizes content by topics, actions, and connections to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, supporting various [[navigational_paths_for_innovation_tool_selection | navigational paths for innovation tool selection]]. Users can:
*   **Browse by topics**: Select disciplines like "digital and technology transformation" to find relevant toolkits, along with index articles providing principles and [[oecd_innovation_playbook_digital_version_introduction | OECD guidance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   **Explore by actions**: Choose "take action" steps like "design a new strategy" to find toolkits tailored for specific problems or approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
*   **Connect to others**: Find toolkits related to "accessing expertise or advice" or "team building and lab practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
*   **Filter and search**: Refine toolkit selections based on criteria like intended audience (e.g., policy makers), features (e.g., checklists), or specific techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. A keyword search function is also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.
*   **Curated collections**: Access pre-filtered lists such as "game-based toolkits," "highly adaptable toolkits," or "starter toolkits" (requiring less advanced innovation practice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

Users can also indicate if they have used or saved a toolkit, which appears in their user profile for easy access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

## User Engagement and Future Development

The [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] is continuously evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. Users are encouraged to share new toolkits they find valuable, provided they are freely accessible, relevant to the public sector, and stimulate action rather than merely building knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. Submissions are reviewed before publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. This collaborative approach enhances the navigator's utility and supports the broader goal of strengthening public sector innovation capacity.

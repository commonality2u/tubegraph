The [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | co-creation boot camp]] assembled 100 participants from diverse sectors, including public sector, private sector, academia, and civil society organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Its primary goal was to [[cocreation_with_stakeholders | co-create]] solutions to civic participation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. These challenges were presented by public sector teams from Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, who were committed to [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation | collaborate with society]] to address them using emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The challenges focused on human-centered design, leveraging technologies like AI, blockchain, and VR to enhance democratic participation and promote inclusive, accessible governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The OECD Design Sprint Process

To transition from identified challenges to prototype solutions, participants followed a structured design sprint process developed by the [[OECDs_Role_in_Public_Sector_Innovation | OECD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Step 1: Aligning on the Challenge

The initial step required teams to achieve a shared understanding of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This involved comprehending the problem itself, its context, and any previous attempts to resolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Teams also identified key stakeholders and users, potential barriers to implementation, and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This ensured a clear direction and unified understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Step 2: Ideation of Solutions

With a clear grasp of the challenges, teams moved into ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This phase involved rapid brainstorming, discarding, and discussion to generate and prioritize ideas for addressing the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The most promising ideas were further developed into well-articulated solution sketches, with participants creating quick drawings to visualize their concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Step 3: Review, Refine, and Select for Prototyping

Following sketching and discussion, teams reviewed and refined their ideas, narrowing down the possibilities to select one for prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Day 2: Prototyping and Pitching

The second day was dedicated to developing the chosen idea into a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Teams began by developing a minimal prototype canvas based on their sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. They explored various approaches, some utilizing digital tools and emerging technologies, while others opted for traditional materials like Legos and modeling clay to create tangible representations quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

As the boot camp concluded, teams prepared five-minute pitches to showcase their solutions to other participants and a jury of experts from Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Three solutions that "pushed the boundaries of civic participation with emerging technologies" were selected for further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The ideas generated are expected to influence the future of civic participation across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

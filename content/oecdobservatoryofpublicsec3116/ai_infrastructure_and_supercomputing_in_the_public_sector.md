The development of advanced technological infrastructure, particularly in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and supercomputing, has become a significant area of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | digital transformation]] within governments. This includes establishing national AI strategies, fostering research and development, integrating AI into education, and providing accessible computing resources for diverse stakeholders.

## Serbia's AI Initiatives

Serbia exemplifies a strategic approach to building a robust AI ecosystem. The country's tech revolution began in 2017 with a shift towards a knowledge and [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]-driven economy, recognizing technology as its engine [00:45:01]. This focus has led to the ICT sector becoming Serbia's largest net exporting sector, with every second job created in the past year belonging to the ICT sector [00:45:50]. In 2022, Serbia was recognized as one of the top 10 countries for progress in e-government by the United Nations e-government development index, and ranked fourth in Europe and 11th globally in the World Bank's GovTech maturity index [00:46:03].

Historically, Serbian innovators like Nikola Tesla had to pursue their ideas abroad due to a lack of infrastructure and support within the country [00:46:27]. The government has aimed to change this by creating a supportive technology and [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] ecosystem [00:46:44].

Key components of Serbia's AI ecosystem include:
*   **National AI Strategy** – Established in 2019, making Serbia the first country in Southeastern Europe and 26th in the world to adopt such a strategy [00:47:57].
*   **AI Institute** – Founded in 2021, this R&D organization navigates new developments in AI, focusing on areas like computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), reading AI, and AI in healthcare. It comprises over 40 researchers and young talents, many of whom are Serbian professionals who returned from abroad [00:48:13].
*   **Funding** – National Science and [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] funds support numerous AI R&D programs for companies and startups [00:48:57].
*   **Education** – Serbia is one of only 11 countries globally with an AI program implemented in primary and secondary education [00:49:07]. There are five master's programs in AI, with plans to expand to seven [00:49:19].
*   **Public Sector Implementation** – Successful AI implementations have occurred in public sector domains such as energy and health [00:49:29].
*   **[[role_of_technology_and_ai_literacy_in_public_service | AI Literacy]] for Civil Service** – [[role_of_technology_and_ai_literacy_in_public_service | Data science]] and AI subjects are part of the National Academy for Public Administration's program, available to civil servants [00:49:41].

### National AI Platform

A cornerstone of Serbia's AI infrastructure is the National AI Platform, recognized as a key enabler for the [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]-driven economy [00:47:41].

*   **Location** – The platform is hosted at the State Data Center in Kragujevac, which opened in 2020 and is one of the largest and most sophisticated data centers in Southeastern Europe [00:50:07].
*   **Technical Specifications** – The supercomputer system is an Nvidia-based cluster, installed in December 2021. It includes an additional Data Science Workspace (DSW), which provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to simplify the use of the platform's computational resources, data management, and overall workflow [00:50:50].
*   **Accessibility** – The government made a "fantastic decision" to offer the platform free of charge to all stakeholders within the Serbian AI ecosystem [00:51:51]. This removes a significant financial barrier for startups, as commercial cloud AI platforms can cost thousands of Euros for relatively small projects [00:52:38].
*   **Users** – The initial user of the platform was the AI Institute, which uses it for projects with industry partners and multinational companies such as Continental, NCR, and Takeda [00:51:25]. A public call for startups was launched in March 2022, selecting the best ideas, products, and solutions [00:52:06]. Currently, the platform serves 24 institutions, including nine faculties, six science and technology institutes, and 19 startup companies, with over 200 user accounts [00:53:10].
*   **Support** – A dedicated team from the Office for E-government manages the platform, administers user accounts, installs necessary environments and tools, and provides daily technical support [00:53:25].

### Future Collaborations and Growth

Serbia plans to continue fostering its AI and GovTech ecosystem through various collaborations:
*   A new round of public calls for startups is planned for the second quarter of the year, providing theoretical and hands-on training to selected participants [00:54:03].
*   Serbia joined Euro HPC in 2022, allowing it to learn from European best practices [00:54:35].
*   Membership in the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) aims to build international AI partnerships [00:54:49].
*   Joining the Digital Euro program and collaborating with the GovTech Campus consortia on GovTech projects [00:55:02].
*   Launching a GovTech program as a sustainable system of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] in the public sector, in cooperation with GIZ and the World Bank, fostering collaboration with companies, universities, and startups [00:55:14].
*   The [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] Fund of Serbia is launching a dedicated grant competition for GovTech startups [00:55:31].
*   Strong bilateral partnerships in AI and GovTech are being pursued, with the United Arab Emirates being a particularly advanced collaboration [00:55:41].

The goal is to create a platform that catalyzes economic development in the private sector by providing access to supercomputing power, potentially helping to reduce the carbon footprint associated with multiple individual data centers [00:56:46].

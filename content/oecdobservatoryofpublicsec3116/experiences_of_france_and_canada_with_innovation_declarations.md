This article explores the experiences of France and and Canada in creating and utilizing national declarations or manifestos to promote [[Governments Role in Promoting Innovation | public sector innovation]]. The discussion highlights how these documents aim to spur innovation, their perceived impact, and the challenges faced in their implementation.

## Canada's Declaration on Public Sector Innovation

Canada's Declaration on [[Public Sector Innovation Declarations | Public Sector Innovation]] was established in November 2017, having been in place for a couple of years at the time of this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:44">[02:42:44]</a>. The initiative began in 2015 when heads of Canada's public services, operating under a federated model of governance (federal, provincial, and territorial governments), discussed the renewal of the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:15">[03:00:15]</a>. The goal was to ensure the public service kept pace with external changes, transformed itself, and remained relevant to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>.

Key challenges identified for the public service across all levels included the use of data, impactful digital technologies, and engaging Canadians in co-creation and co-design of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:04">[04:04:04]</a>. Annual gatherings of public sector innovation helped coalesce the idea of a declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:42">[04:21:42]</a>.

### Purpose and Impact
The Declaration is non-binding but serves to send a signal across all public service systems that leaders care about these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:24">[04:36:24]</a>. It encourages trying new things, taking risks, and recognizing that not everything will always work, with the ultimate aim of delivering better policies and programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:04">[04:55:04]</a>. Drafted in early 2017, the document includes high-level, aspirational statements on new partnerships, data, technology, and funding models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:07">[05:03:07]</a>.

The Declaration was the first time all heads of public services in Canada signed onto something together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:30">[06:13:30]</a>. It has been used as a "signpost" to empower agencies and decision-makers to pursue new ideas and transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:56">[06:27:56]</a>. It also facilitates more meaningful engagement with provincial and territorial colleagues to collaboratively try new ideas and de-risk initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:30">[07:00:30]</a>.

### Reception and Challenges
While received well in some circles and acknowledged in others, the Declaration has not fully transformed the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:38">[18:57:38]</a>. The speaker noted that the concept of innovation and experimentation is still in its "infancy or adolescent phase" within the Canadian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:21">[20:01:21]</a>. There was no negative backlash to the Declaration itself, but its reception reflects the ongoing work to advance innovation from a "side of desk" activity to "center of desk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:06">[19:27:06]</a>.

## France's Manifesto for Public Sector Innovation

France's Manifesto for [[Public Sector Innovation Declarations | Public Sector Innovation]] was released in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:46">[08:35:46]</a>. The impetus came from a growing interest in innovation within the French administration in 2016, exemplified by the creation of a new generation of public labs across French regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:14">[09:01:14]</a>. There was an expectation to define [[Public Sector Innovation Declarations | public sector innovation]] within the French context and provide guidelines, as many new public servants were unfamiliar with concepts like labs, design, and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:52">[09:14:52]</a>.

### Purpose and Impact
The Manifesto aimed to provide guidelines based on what works and doesn't work, ensuring that [[Public Sector Innovation Declarations | public sector innovation]] was not just a "fashion" but could yield serious results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:31">[10:01:31]</a>. It emphasizes that innovation, when done seriously and with a specific goal, can be a "new approach to public policymaking" with significant impact on policy and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:27">[10:46:27]</a>.

The most obvious result of the Manifesto was providing a common reference text for innovation within the French administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:05">[11:21:05]</a>. It was used by officials, such as the digital minister at an [[European Union and OECD collaborations on innovation | OECD conference]], to articulate France's vision for [[Public Sector Innovation Declarations | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:43">[11:29:43]</a>. For public servants, particularly those in the "public sector innovators" community, it provided a basis and legitimacy for their projects, demonstrating that their work was serious and impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:05">[12:21:05]</a>. The Manifesto became a main tool in developing this community, which grew to 600-700 people, fostering a shared vision, mindset, values, principles, and common challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:44">[13:08:44]</a>.

### Reception and Challenges
Initial difficulties were encountered in getting the Manifesto endorsed by leadership, with some suggesting it might be "too early" or that the country was not "mature" enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:03">[16:18:03]</a>. Even after release, there is still some hostility or a lack of seriousness from many in government and top administration who don't understand or don't want to work differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:30">[16:53:30]</a>. The speaker acknowledged that the Manifesto alone is not enough to transform governments and has not yet achieved its full potential impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:08">[17:29:08]</a>.

## International Collaboration and OECD's Perspective

The [[International Collaboration on Innovation | OECD]] is working to elevate the concept of [[Public Sector Innovation Declarations | public sector innovation declarations]] to a global level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:19">[02:47:19]</a>. Rebecca Santos, an advisor at the Secretary of Public Sector Innovation at the [[European Union and OECD collaborations on innovation | OECD]], manages the [[Public Consultation Process for Innovation Declarations | public consultation process]] for the draft declaration on [[Public Sector Innovation Declarations | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The OECD's draft declaration aims to foster common agreement at an international level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:59">[02:02:59]</a>.

Alex Roberts, an analyst in the OECD's team, emphasizes that innovation inherently pushes activity towards more segmented and contextual patterns, so the declaration is about bringing countries together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:03">[02:29:03]</a>. It signals that [[Governments Role in Promoting Innovation | innovation]] matters and is an integral part of how governments operate, not just an add-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:19">[02:47:19]</a>. The draft is based on extensive work with countries, including a detailed [[public_sector_innovation_systems_in_canada | public sector innovation system study]] with the Public Service of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Key Principles for Innovation
Roberts highlights that while [[Governments Role in Promoting Innovation | innovation]] has always occurred, the current rate needs to match modern challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. The OECD promotes a more sophisticated conversation and accessible language around innovation, unpacking the word into "innovation facets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>:
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation**: Improving existing processes and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented innovation**: Achieving large, ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation**: Responding to a changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation**: Engaging with weak signals early to shape change rather than just react to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

Governments should maintain a "portfolio" approach across these facets to be ready for unpredictable challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. The declaration aims to codify this language and tell a richer story about why [[Governments Role in Promoting Innovation | innovation]] matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. It emphasizes that *all* public servants have a role to play, not just those in [[government_innovation_incubators_and_safe_spaces_for_experimentation | labs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Key elements include embracing existing innovation, equipping public servants, fostering new partnerships and diverse perspectives, and continuous learning and sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

### Public Consultation and Future Steps
The [[Public Consultation Process for Innovation Declarations | public consultation process]] for the OECD's draft declaration was launched in November 2018 and concluded on February 22, 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. The OECD sought feedback on what made sense, language suggestions (e.g., "weak signals," "civil servant" vs. "public servant"), and the feasibility of proposed actions in different national contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. For example, feedback highlighted the need to frame "failure" within "experimentation" for auditing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

The declaration is intended to be an official [[International Collaboration on Innovation | OECD instrument]], but it is not legally binding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Member countries can affirm their commitment to its ideals, using it to signal the importance of innovation and draw good ideas for their innovation strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. It encourages governments to adopt a portfolio approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. The OECD primarily works with national governments but welcomes perspectives from local governments, recognizing that innovation is an ecosystem activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

[[Public Consultation Process for Innovation Declarations | Citizen participation]] is considered a crucial part of an effective [[Public Sector Innovation Declarations | public sector innovation]] process, relying on understanding diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The OECD also conducts ongoing work on [[government_innovation_incubators_and_safe_spaces_for_experimentation | leadership mindsets and skills]] required for innovation competency and capability within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

The modern era demands that governments continually change what they do, as they operate in an environment of constant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Innovation must be a consistent, deliberate, and reliable resource to maintain the same level of outcomes in an evolving economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. A government that fails to innovate risks being perpetually behind, reactive, and disappointing to its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This necessity is particularly acute in the face of technological disruption.

## Challenges Posed by Disruptive Technologies

Disruptive technologies, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), present new policy [[challenges_requiring_government_innovation | challenges requiring government innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. These advancements force governments to re-evaluate their fundamental role within the innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>. The issue is not *if* governments will learn to adopt and apply these technologies, but *when* and *how quickly* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>.

### The Problem of Suitability

Governments often struggle to take advantage of innovative options because existing feedback loops tend to favor investment in well-understood solutions over emergent ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>. This creates a significant mismatch between what can be done inside and outside of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>. If governments wait until a new technology is fully understood, they become "takers" rather than "shapers" of that technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>. This delay can lead to a loss of the ability to become a sophisticated consumer and reduce the government's "absorptive capacity" to engage with and leverage new innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a>.

To avoid this, governments must invest in and support the technology infrastructure, systems, and capabilities that match their evolving context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>. This requires continuous learning and keeping pace with external change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.

## Government Responses and Strategies

### [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | Anticipatory Innovation]]

A key area of work for governments is understanding what an [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipatory innovation]] system looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>. This involves being open to emergent disruptive shifts and actively shaping how these technologies play out, rather than passively waiting and then intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>. Governments are increasingly aware of the risks of allowing disruptive technologies, like social media, to develop without early engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>.

Agencies that are generally well-attuned to emergent and disruptive technologies are those where "the costs of being surprised are very well understood," such as in defense, medicine, animal health, and crop production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.

### Experimentation and Learning

In Canada, a Deputy Minister Task Force on public sector innovation has been established with a mandate to explore two key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>:
1.  Core systems transformation (e.g., programming, human resources, procurement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.
2.  Experimenting with disruptive technologies like AI and blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>.

The goal is to learn lessons on how to adapt and adopt these technologies into government operations to become smarter, more risk-savvy, and more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>.

### Examples of Technological Innovation

*   **Digital Identity Management:** Experiments are being conducted on how blockchain technology can play a role in digital identity management, aiming for a secure and user-friendly single digital identity for citizens interacting with the federal government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>.
*   **Translation Services:** Advances in AI are being explored to make translation services (e.g., English to French and vice versa) more effective and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>. These are being tested on a small scale, with an agile approach of learning, communicating, and redoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>.

### Foundational Elements

A critical foundational piece for utilizing [[role_of_digital_advancements_in_public_sector_innovation | digital advancements]] and disruptive technologies is how data is collected and used within the federal architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:28">[01:21:28]</a>. The Government of Canada has released a data strategy, which is a foundational element for moving into the space of disruptive technologies in a more informed way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:43">[01:21:43]</a>.

## Systemic Innovation for a Changing World

Innovation needs to be systemic, repeatable, and consistent, rather than an ad-hoc, reactive, or opportunistic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This means understanding the underlying innovation system and making it more deliberate and explicit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

For governments to meet the needs of a changing world driven by technology, innovation must become:
*   **Systemic:** Embedded and repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Consistent:** Not just a reaction to specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Core Competency:** One of the primary options considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

The challenges posed by disruptive technologies underscore the urgent need for governments to mature their innovation systems to effectively serve citizens and [[preparing_for_future_challenges_through_government_innovation | prepare for future challenges]].

The OECD's Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) team is currently managing a [[public_participation_and_trust_in_urban_governance | public consultation process]] for a draft declaration on public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The goal is to gather diverse feedback to refine the document and foster common international agreement on the importance of innovation in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

## Timeline and Participation
The [[public_participation_and_trust_in_urban_governance | public consultation process]] was launched in November of the previous year at the OPSI conference in Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. It is scheduled to conclude on February 22nd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

Anyone can respond to the consultation, either as an individual or on behalf of an organization, a specific group, or even an entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. This includes government workers, those who work alongside government, community members, and academics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>.

## Desired Feedback
The OPSI team is seeking specific types of contributions to iterate and strengthen the draft declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>:

*   **Clarity and Wording**
    *   Feedback on whether directives and proposed actions make sense or need different wording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.
    *   Pointing out terms that are unclear, require further explanation (e.g., footnotes), or could be rephrased in plain English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. For example, the term "weak signals" was identified as potentially confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   **Language and Cultural Context**
    *   Suggestions for terminology that might be unknown or carry different meanings in various cultural contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. An example given is the distinction between "public servant" and "civil servant" in different countries like Ireland, where "civil servant" refers to a smaller, legally distinct group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   **Feasibility and Implications**
    *   Insights into whether proposed actions or activities would be useful or impossible within a specific country's context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.
    *   Information on the possible implications a directive or activity might have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. For instance, while encouraging experimentation and learning from failure, it's important to note that "failure" for auditing purposes needs to be understood as part of a distinct, program-specific experimental activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.

The team encourages "frankness" in feedback to ensure the document is as useful and strong as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

## Next Steps and Purpose
After the [[public_participation_and_trust_in_urban_governance | public consultation process]] closes, the feedback will be used to refine the draft declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. The revised document will then be proposed to the OECD's Public Governance Committee for further consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

The declaration, once finalized, is intended to be an official OECD instrument, but it will **not** be legally binding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. Member countries can affirm their commitment to its ideals, but they will not be measured against its tenets in the same way as other OECD instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

The ultimate aim for countries signing on is to use the declaration as a tool to:
*   Signal the importance of innovation within their government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.
*   Draw good ideas, actions, and directives to inform their own innovation strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.
*   Promote a portfolio approach to innovation, ensuring a range of innovation types are pursued to address various challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.
*   Inspire the management of diverse innovation strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.
*   Encourage deeper reflection on how their existing systems support or hinder innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## Broader Context and Related Initiatives
The declaration aims to foster a more sophisticated conversation about innovation, recognizing its multifaceted nature and encouraging a portfolio approach to prepare for unpredictable challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. It acknowledges that [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | citizen participation]] is a crucial part of effective public sector innovation, as it relies on understanding diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. OPSI actively works with other OECD colleagues, such as those focusing on open government, to demonstrate different ways citizens can be engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.

While the OECD primarily engages with national governments, the declaration is also interested in the perspectives of local governments and innovation ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. Local and state governments can play a significant role in the overall innovation system, and they can affirm their commitment to the declaration to signal support to their stakeholders, even if not officially binding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.

The development of the declaration is informed by ongoing research into leadership mindsets and skills required for developing innovation competency and capability within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. This includes understanding the different forms of leadership and diverse skills needed at various stages of the innovation process, from problem understanding to implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. This research acknowledges that a complete innovation ecosystem involves many players contributing at different stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

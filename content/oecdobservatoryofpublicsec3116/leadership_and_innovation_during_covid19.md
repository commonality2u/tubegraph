This article summarizes key insights from Minister Nikolai Astrup of Norway, focusing on how leadership and innovation have played a crucial role in the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and what lessons can be drawn for future governance. The discussion took place during the "Forum on Government After Shock," a series of global events focused on rethinking and rebuilding through [[public_sector_innovation during COVID19 | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Key Principles of Norway's Response

Minister Astrup highlighted several core principles that have guided Norway's [[government_responses to COVID19 and innovation | government responses to COVID-19]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>:

### Building and Maintaining Trust
The fundamental goal during the crisis has been to bring people on board and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Norway, already a society with high trust, leveraged this as an important factor in its response measures and the public's willingness to follow advice and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Strategies to foster trust include:
*   **Communication is Key** Regular press conferences from the central government, often several times a week, were vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Reaching All Demographics** Unique approaches like press conferences specifically for children, where the Prime Minister and other ministers answered questions, helped build understanding across all population segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. "People's question time" on platforms like Facebook, allowing direct public interaction with ministers, also proved successful in building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Transparency** Being open about why measures are implemented, acknowledging both certainties and uncertainties, and being honest about difficult decisions (e.g., balancing health and economic implications) is crucial for maintaining trust <a class="yt="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Targeted Outreach** Recognizing that some communities, like immigrant communities, might not receive information through traditional channels, Norway actively engaged with religious leaders to convey guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Coordination** Close coordination between national, county, and municipal levels, involving multiple ministers and county governors, ensured a unified yet adaptable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Based Decisions** Government decisions are closely aligned with health authorities and scientific advice, and any disregard for such advice is openly explained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Balancing National Imperatives with Local Needs
While Norway operates with national guidelines, requirements, and advice, it's equally important that local governments have the authority and means to adapt [[challenges_and_responses_during_the_covid19_pandemic | COVID-19 measures]] to their specific local situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This flexibility is critical because circumstances vary greatly across the country (e.g., major outbreaks in cities versus no cases in smaller communities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Overly harsh or insufficient local restrictions can both erode public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

The government also prioritizes supporting municipalities financially and with guidance to follow up on vulnerable groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. For example, it was mandated that healthcare workers focusing on vulnerable children should not be diverted to COVID-19 tracing, emphasizing the long-term view of the crisis as a "marathon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## Innovation Accelerated by Crisis

The COVID-19 crisis has "thrust upon us" the need for rapid [[government_innovation during COVID19 | government innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. This unprecedented pressure has accelerated changes that governments had long aspired to:

*   **Digital Transformation:** Norway has seen an explosion in the use of online consultations with health services, a goal for a long time but one that only gained widespread adoption during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. This shift is expected to continue post-COVID-19 due to its efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
*   **Removing Legal Barriers:** The crisis forced a quick review of legal frameworks to identify and remove "legal barriers to digitalization," such as laws requiring physical meetings or signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This move towards "technology-neutral" and "AI-ready" laws is seen as the beginning of a larger transformation to prevent legal frameworks from hindering [[public_sector_innovation in response to COVID19 | innovation]] and digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

## Fostering a Culture of Innovation

Minister Astrup outlined three crucial elements for driving change and [[role_of_innovation_ecosystems_during_a_crisis | innovation]]:

1.  **Culture:** Cultivating a culture that encourages thinking outside the box, challenging existing methods, allowing new ideas, and accepting a degree of "failure" (within the constraints of public funds) is essential for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
2.  **Leadership:** Leaders must inspire this culture of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
3.  **Competence:** Adequate competence is needed to follow through on innovations. This often requires close cooperation between national and municipal levels, especially for smaller municipalities lacking resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

## Inter-Governmental Collaboration for Seamless Services

A new white paper on [[innovation_in_cities_postCOVID19 | innovation in the public sector]] and a digitalization strategy for the public sector were developed in close cooperation with municipal organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. This collaboration is vital because the public doesn't care whether a service is provided by the state or a municipality; they only care about receiving good quality, hassle-free services when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. The aim is to make services seamless across governmental levels.

## Lessons Learned and Future Outlook

The crisis has significantly impacted existing trends, particularly accelerating digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. The Minister expressed that we are just at the beginning of learning [[lessons_learned_from_the_covid19_pandemic_for_future_governance_strategies | lessons from COVID-19]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. The experience has highlighted the need for better coordination and the safeguarding of the spirit of innovation observed during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

The crisis has also underscored the interconnectedness of society, emphasizing that "we are all in the same boat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>. This shared understanding and reinforced trust are crucial for tackling other major challenges, such as climate change and growing inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Cooperation, pulling together, and building trust are key to solving these complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.

## Poll Results on Government Roles

A poll conducted during the session asked participants about the most effective roles national and federal governments played in response to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The results were:
*   Deploying a unified response: 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>
*   Enabling other actors (subnational level): 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>
*   Countering negative economic impact: 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>
*   Providing direct support to citizens: 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>

Minister Astrup found these results natural, as the crisis profoundly impacts people's lives and livelihoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. He stressed that addressing economic impact and providing direct support is paramount, but achieving this effectively requires strong coordination, a unified response, transparency, and trustâ€”it's not an either/or situation, but a holistic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

[[CAF Common Assessment Framework | The Common Assessment Framework (CAF)]] and [[quality management | quality management]] are identified as crucial elements that can support and influence public sector innovation, despite often being discussed separately from innovation topics like lean management or disruptive leaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>. They are closely linked and influence the types of innovations that organizations pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a>.

## The City of Vienna's Approach to Quality Management

The City of Vienna has a long-standing tradition of viewing public services and citizen needs holistically, dating back around 100 years with municipal housing and one-stop shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>. This approach has led to Vienna being considered a perfect place for living, experiencing rapid growth, and achieving high rankings in governance, quality of living, and smart city indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>.

Central to Vienna's development is the concept of "quality of governance for quality of living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>. The city believes its closeness to citizens is a key factor in its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>.

Key aspects of Vienna's [[quality management | quality management]] journey include:
*   **Mindset Shift** The city administration transitioned its role from a classic administration maintaining order to a facilitator, looking at needs and opportunities, and developing together with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This required a change of mindset within the administration and civil society, meeting citizens who also desired such a collaborative approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>.
*   **Partnership Administration** The city has moved through stages from classic traditional administration to new public management, into good governance, and finally to a very close partnership form of administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. This partnership allowed for a needed pace of development, enabling staff and citizens to adjust to new approaches gradually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>.
*   **Response to Crisis** The established preparatory steps and work in [[quality management | quality management]] made the city fit to respond to disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic. Trust and new forms of partnership allowed for providing timely information and guidance through the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.
*   **Core Principles** The transformation is characterized by a focus on culture (organizational and societal), open and active communication, transparency, and utmost participation within the administration, with citizens, and with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>. This mutual journey involves exchanging expectations, trying out feasible solutions, and spreading the word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.
*   **Impact Orientation** Vienna's [[quality management | quality management]] emphasizes impact and customer orientation, supported by a systematic agreement system between political and administrative levels to constantly provide new services and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>.

### The [[CAF Common Assessment Framework | Common Assessment Framework]] (CAF)

The [[CAF Common Assessment Framework | Common Assessment Framework]] is a tool designed by public administration experts from the EU specifically for enhancement-oriented innovation in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:54">[01:24:54]</a>. It is over 20 years old but remains relevant due to its continuous evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>.

Key features of [[CAF Common Assessment Framework | CAF]]:
*   **Guidance for Modern Public Administration** It provides guidance for both modern public administration practices and cultural change within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:22">[01:25:22]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement** [[CAF Common Assessment Framework | CAF]] is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, promoting [[continuous_improvement_and_organizational_resilience | continuous improvement]] and fostering a learning organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>.
*   **Self-Assessment** It emphasizes self-assessment, leveraging internal expertise, and building partnerships with citizens, other public administrations, and stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>.
*   **Principles of Excellence** [[CAF Common Assessment Framework | CAF]] is rooted in the principles of excellence and aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, linking local strategies to broader global and European development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.
*   **Versatility** It is designed to be easily handled and can be applied by any department, organization, or for any topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>.

The impact of Vienna's adoption of [[CAF Common Assessment Framework | CAF]] and [[quality management | quality management]] is seen in enhanced expertise, self-development, and the achievement of the city's role as a facilitator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:12">[01:27:12]</a>. This is exemplified by initiatives like "Smart City Vienna," which focuses on continuous development for citizens across environmental, economic, and technical aspects, encouraging citizen participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>. The citizens and staff of Vienna's administration now see it as a reliable and capable partner for the future, interested in common good and providing guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>.

## Integration with Broader Public Sector Innovation

The discussion on [[quality management | quality management]] and [[CAF Common Assessment Framework | CAF]] highlights how these frameworks support the push for productivity increases and enhancement-oriented innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. They provide a systematic way to review existing activities from an enhancement perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>.

Challenges related to adopting such approaches include:
*   **Mindset Issues** Narratives like "we've always done it this way" can hinder progress, even among enthusiastic individuals within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:07">[01:46:07]</a>. Identifying and collaborating with those willing to embrace change is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:40">[01:46:40]</a>.
*   **Subtraction Bias** Humans tend to add new elements to systems rather than subtract existing ones, even when they are ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>. Incentivizing the suppression or undoing of processes could be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>.
*   **Status Quo Bias** Once a service or innovation is operational, it becomes difficult to challenge or remove, even if it is no longer optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>. Regular reviews and not taking services for granted are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.

Despite these challenges, the discussion highlighted the importance of frameworks like [[CAF Common Assessment Framework | CAF]], service design, and participatory methods (e.g., hackathons, empathy labs, gamification) to get closer to users and design services that truly meet their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:06">[01:47:06]</a>. These methods contribute to ensuring that innovations are not just incremental but can lead to significant improvements in public sector productivity and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:11">[01:57:11]</a>.

Psychological costs are a significant component of "sludge" in public services, referring to the unnecessary frictions that hinder access, impose mental burdens, and erode public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This concept, championed by Professor Cass Sunstein, shifts the focus from purely administrative burdens to the human experience of navigating government processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. While the term "sludge" is relatively new, the burden it describes is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Importance of Addressing Psychological Costs

People's interactions with government services profoundly influence their perceptions of government responsiveness and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Public satisfaction with administrative and social services is a key driver of trust in public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. When services are difficult to access, trust can be eroded, making it harder to implement necessary policy reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

The Oecd's 2021 survey on trust in public institutions revealed that less than four in ten respondents believed complaining about a poorly performing service would lead to improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This highlights the need to address the daily interactions between citizens and public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Reducing sludge is not just about administrative efficiency, but about reshaping public services to be more equitable, accessible, and trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This approach enhances government responsiveness and bolsters trust, especially among vulnerable populations who are most reliant on public services and most likely to suffer psychological burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Nature of Psychological Costs

Psychological costs, distinct from administrative burdens, put a behavioral lens on the challenges users face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. They are often unintentional, with public servants typically not aiming to create frictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. However, these costs accumulate and can become significant barriers, particularly for vulnerable individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

Typical examples of sludge that lead to psychological costs include:
*   Information that is hard to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   Processes that are hard to understand or complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   Very long waiting times without updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   Complex decision points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

The Oecd has made an effort to better define and categorize these psychological costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. They include:

*   **Search Costs:** Occur when people struggle to find necessary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Decision Costs:** Arise when people are asked to evaluate multiple options, especially if they are very similar, leading to psychological overload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Costs:** The mental resources required to fulfill requirements or understand complex information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This refers to the "brain capital" individuals must expend to overcome unclear information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Emotional Costs:** Include stigma, loss of autonomy, and feelings of stress, disempowerment, anxiety, or frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a> All these [[Psychological and Emotional Costs in Public Service Access | psychological costs]] enormously impact vulnerable people, including vulnerable groups and individuals experiencing challenging life circumstances like natural disasters or giving birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Sludge has its highest impact when people are at their most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Addressing Psychological Costs: The Role of Sludge Audits

To identify and address frictions that affect people using government services, new tools and methods are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Sludge audits are a welcome addition to this toolkit and need to be mainstreamed across public administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### The New South Wales Sludge Audit Method

The New South Wales Department of Customer Service developed a sludge audit method, inspired by Cass Sunstein's work, that has been in use for four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This method aims to integrate [[Behavioral insights in government | behavioral science]] evidence into service improvement by focusing on psychological aspects of burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

Key features and benefits of this method include:
*   **Systematic use of behavioral science evidence:** Overcoming the prior lack of systematic application of behavioral science in service improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Quantification:** Isolating and quantifying different aspects of sludge, particularly psychological costs and equity aspects, which are often hard to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. The four key metrics are time, cost, effort, and inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
*   **Data-driven prioritization:** Making sludge reduction easier by providing guidance on how to prioritize fixes and measure their impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

The New South Wales method has been tested on nearly 100 audits, significantly impacting various services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. It is a seven-step process, with a toolkit including a "sludge finder" web tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

### The First International Sludge Academy

The Oecd and New South Wales partnered to pilot this methodology outside Australia through the First International Sludge Academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.
*   Launched at the Oecd Network of [[Behavioral insights in government | Behavioral Insights]] Experts in Government meeting in Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.
*   22 countries expressed interest, with 16 teams from 14 countries selected to conduct parallel sludge audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   Participating countries attended masterclasses and received one-on-one mentorship and coaching from New South Wales colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   Teams reviewed results, developed, and implemented solutions, sharing learnings throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

The academy revealed a global desire among governments to reduce sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Audits covered a diverse range of processes, from citizen-facing services (e.g., in France and Brazil) to internal government processes like HR services (e.g., in Canada and Australia at the federal level) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. This expanded the application of sludge audits beyond public services to internal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

#### Case Study: France – Assistance for Independent Living (APA)

The French behavioral insights team applied the sludge audit method to the "Assistance for Independent Living" (APA) application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. This aid helps elderly people stay at home, but the application process had high abandonment rates due to complexity and varying versions of letters across territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

The audit involved:
*   Interviewing 20 people across nine departments, including caregivers, applicants, and support professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.
*   Reviewing existing forms and walking applicants step-by-step through the process to understand time taken, letters gathered, and emotional responses like frustration or abandonment points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

This detailed audit allowed the team to prioritize the most problematic areas, moving beyond simple language simplification to address processes that created inequality or complex steps for specific users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

Key takeaways from France's experience:
*   **User-centricity:** The audit process was highly user-centric, helping the administration understand the user's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   **Objective Analysis:** It provided an objective analysis of complexities and areas where time could be saved for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.
*   **Multi-dimensional Insight:** It included insights into [[Psychological and Emotional Costs in Public Service Access | psychological costs]] and [[Digitalization and government services | inclusion issues]], offering a multi-dimensional view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.
*   **Autonomous Diagnosis:** Governments can autonomously conduct and replicate these audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.

Challenges noted included a lack of objective data, requiring significant time to gather information, and the need for future discussions on dedicated sludge audit positions versus training administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>.

#### Case Study: Brazil – Go.br Account Recovery

Brazil's Ministry of Management and Innovation Public Services selected the recovery of the "Go.br" account for their audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. This account serves as the main entry point to over 4,000 [[Digitalization and government services | digital government services]] in Brazil, used by 150 million people annually, with over 100 million recovery requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.

While the automated recovery process (with digital and facial recognition) is well-designed for some, vulnerable users who cannot use it face a more difficult and costly process through online forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

Brazil is developing its own sludge audit tool and methodology, aiming for a systematic approach and recognizing that different citizen groups have different journeys, allowing for an "equity check" to identify where more guidance is needed to avoid sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. Their goal is a self-applied tool for use by federal, state, and municipal governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.

Brazil views sludge audits as a good entry point for [[Behavioral insights in government | behavioral insights]] in governments, making it easy to communicate goals and present results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. They also learned that the audit tool itself must be designed to avoid sludge, for instance, by reducing the number of questions in questionnaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. The term "sludge" can be difficult to communicate in their context, leading them to seek more positive framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. Ultimately, sludge reduction is seen as crucial for promoting inclusiveness, equity, and public perception of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

### Nine Good Practice Principles for Sludge Reduction

The International Sludge Academy identified nine principles to support governments in conducting sludge audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>:

1.  **Control over changes:** Assess how much control the team has over changing the process or implementing solutions to identified sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. A strong "line of sight" between the audit and implementation is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
2.  **Predefined methodology:** Using a common, tested methodology ensures rigor, reliability, and allows for replication and comparisons across different contexts and times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.
3.  **Tailoring the audit to context:** Accommodating complicated, non-linear behavioral journeys in government services, which may involve multiple stages and interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.
4.  **Deploying an equity lens:** Recognizing that sludge disproportionately affects underserved communities and potentially focusing audits purely on their experience, even if they represent a small percentage of total users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
5.  **Evaluating progress:** Translating sludge audits into concrete changes on the ground and re-auditing services to measure the impact of implemented changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
6.  **System enablers:**
    *   Having a government committed to improving user services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
    *   Closer connection to service owners to gain buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.
    *   Access to systematically collected customer survey data for continuous feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

## Impact and Future Directions

The work on sludge reduction in government services is actively supported by the Oecd, which is developing an international standard on human-centered public administrative services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This recommendation, open for public consultation until July 7th, sets a clear policy framework to put people at the center of service design and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

The Oecd plans for a second International Sludge Academy to build on the success of the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. Key developments for the next academy include:
*   **Diverse support for teams:** Catering to teams with different needs, from those able to conduct audits independently to those requiring more guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.
*   **Methodological refinement:** Further developing the sludge audit method itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   **Broader audience:** Opening the academy to a wider range of government teams beyond just [[Behavioral insights in government | behavioral science]] units, including program, policy, and service delivery teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   **Enhanced peer learning:** Emphasizing knowledge sharing and collaboration among the growing community of teams conducting sludge audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.
*   **Benchmarking and comparative analysis:** Bringing countries together to examine common processes like passport renewal to identify sludge and opportunities for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.

The overarching goal is to [[Strategies for Reducing Bureaucratic Frictions | give people more time]] by reducing administrative burdens, ensuring that services are dignified and easy to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. The application of [[Implementation of Behavioral Science in Government | behavioral science]] and [[Adaptive innovation in public services | adaptive innovation in public services]] through initiatives like sludge audits are key to achieving these goals and driving [[Public administration reform | public administration reform]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.

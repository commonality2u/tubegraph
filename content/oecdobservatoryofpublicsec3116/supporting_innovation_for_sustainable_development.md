The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences are expected to significantly increase poverty and drive further inequality worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Recent reports, including the *States of Fragility report* and the *Global Outlook on Financing for Sustainable Development*, highlight this dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. To address these challenges, there is a critical need to explore how to promote innovations that benefit the poorest and most vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

A poll conducted during a session revealed that 88% of participants believe [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges|innovations can provide an effective response]] to the challenge of leaving no one behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. However, 61% disagreed and 19% strongly disagreed with the statement that the COVID-19 crisis reveals governments and their partners are doing enough to enable innovation for sustainable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This indicates a significant need to further foster innovation in response to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## The Role of Government in Fostering Innovation

An enabling local environment is critical for successful innovation, and creating such an environment largely depends on governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

Dr. Jemilah Mahmood, Special Advisor to the Prime Minister of Malaysia on Public Health, emphasizes that innovation is very much local and driven by the people themselves living in communities facing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. She cautions that the innovation environment is highly heterogeneous, meaning what works at a local level may not need to be taken to scale globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Malaysia's Global Innovation Center, for example, creates an "innovation sandbox" with significant funding and mentorship for local innovators, including matching grants for social enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This extends regionally within ASEAN, allowing for approaches applicable to different countries and enabling social enterprises to penetrate the ASEAN market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Professor Jaideep Prabhu, an expert in [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges|innovation in emerging markets]], suggests governments should resist controlling and duplicating others' activities, instead focusing on coordinating, facilitating, and nurturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. He uses the metaphor that governments should "steer" rather than "row" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. A crucial role for governments is supporting the innovation ecosystem, which requires both encouraging varied experiments and having mechanisms for selection and scaling of successful ideas, or "positive deviance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:16:01]</a>. Digital platforms can facilitate this, as seen with USAID's Million Lives Club and the Commonwealth Secretariat's platform for member countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

Amy Lynn, Acting Director of USAID's Center for Innovation and Impact, agrees with the value of nurturing over controlling, which applies to donor governments as well as local partner governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Frugal and Locally-Led Innovation

[[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges|Frugal innovation]], championed by Jaideep Prabhu, is about "doing more and better for more people with less resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. It's inspired by individuals at the grassroots level who, facing problems with limited resources, come up with ingenious solutions by repurposing and reusing existing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. This approach is powerful because it avoids reinventing the wheel and focuses on affordable solutions for beneficiaries and deliverers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

Examples from the pandemic demonstrate frugal innovation:
*   **Prevention**: Maker spaces in India, a collective of 42 rural and urban spaces, quickly produced face masks from available materials, including transparency sheets, for frontline workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
*   **Care**: Repurposing existing infrastructure, such as train compartments in France being converted into mobile wards, or pop-up hospitals in stadia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.
*   **Cure**: Doctors repurposing existing, affordable drugs like dexamethasone to effectively treat COVID symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

USAID has seen the value in repurposing and adapting existing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. For instance, the two-way communication platform "mHero," initially funded during the Ebola outbreak, is now crucial for sharing COVID-19 information with frontline health workers in Liberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. They also supported Shift Labs' "Drip Assist," a device for monitoring IV infusion rates that costs one-tenth of a typical pump and is easy to train on, offering more effective solutions at a lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

At a sub-national level, USAID partnered with Project Last Mile in South Africa's Western Cape to enable local manufacturers to produce textile masks, aiming for over 100,000 in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Innovation Development

Amy Lynn points out that while there is a global outpouring of creativity for new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, there are significant constraints:
*   **Navigating deployment**: It's challenging to deploy innovations at scale due to regulatory hurdles, the need for behavior change, and stakeholder coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
*   **Funding**: The economic recession has led to enormous outflows of private capital and foreign direct investment from low and middle-income countries, creating a significant funding gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

To address these, USAID is designing a "country innovation platform" to streamline the process, anchoring it in local country contexts and connecting appropriate innovators with country stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. They also work with development finance corporations (DFCs) to explore co-financing opportunities and support social entrepreneurs with more than just grants, seeking to attract investment capital into the global health space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

Jamila Mahmood highlights that beyond the immediate health crisis, there's a multi-sectoral need for innovation across humanitarian, development, and financial spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. She advocates for integrating environmental impact into innovation, such as developing biodegradable PPEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. Financial innovations, like Malaysia's use of Islamic social financing (Sukuk model and Islamic bond), can empower local women and communities and address health aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. For future vaccine distribution, innovations are needed for cold chains in remote areas, possibly by repurposing telecom towers with generators to hold fridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. Logistics can be improved by pooling resources like tourist buses for transport, similar to an Uber-like application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Furthermore, technology plays a vital [[role_of_innovation_in_sustainable_urban_development|role of innovation in sustainable urban development]] in addressing mental health support for frontline workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

## The Role of the International Community and Private Sector

The international community can provide resources, knowledge, evidence, and political capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>. However, it needs to do things differently to promote locally-led innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.

Jamila Mahmood advocates for localization, urging donors to invest in supporting local structures that drive innovation, as this often costs less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. She also suggests a regional approach, like investing in an ASEAN CDC (Centers for Disease Control) to pull resources, research, and innovation pertinent to the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Donors must be willing to take risks to enable locally-driven innovations, shifting their mindset away from previous practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

Jaideep Prabhu stresses that the private sector has a huge role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. He critiques the traditional 20th-century approach of large companies focusing on expensive technology pushes for affluent customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. In emerging markets, the business model needs to shift to "wafer-thin margins" on highly affordable products/services, compensated by reaching large volumes of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. This can be highly profitable, and companies that don't adapt risk being outcompeted by emerging market counterparts or agile digital startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines by pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer, often in partnership with startups like BioNTech, shows how large companies can learn to do [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges|frugal innovation]] and scale quickly when incentives align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

The ideal dynamic between governments, corporations, and citizens involves:
*   **Government as facilitator**: Creating an ecosystem and spaces (e.g., digital platforms, regulatory sandboxes) that bring together entrepreneurs and grassroots innovators with larger organizations that can select and scale ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>.
*   **Government as procurer**: Government procurement can be a powerful incentive for aligning efforts toward solutions for identified problems, like the SDGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **Private Sector as partner**: Large corporations can work with smaller companies to develop ideas and bring them to market faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.
*   **Incentives**: Governments can use incentives and disincentives in budgets to encourage private sector participation in nation-building and citizen welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. Malaysia, for example, is leveraging the private sector for upskilling and reskilling programs to address unemployment, with companies committed to absorbing newly trained individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>.

## Innovation for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated the challenges to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with the financing gap increasing from $2.5 trillion to $4.2 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

Amy Lynn emphasizes the need for empathy to understand local governments' values, priorities, and constraints to effectively partner and find pathways to adopt innovations for the SDGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>. She suggests two approaches for development partners:
1.  **Creative Support**: Converting the "global pile-up of innovations" into a true pipeline by curating the best ideas for specific local needs, such as newborn health or mental health, rather than pushing a global agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.
2.  **Strategic Repurposing**: Leveraging existing access to manufacturing, supply chains, cold chains, and financing structures. This includes blending different types of capital (e.g., grants with return-seeking capital) to lower risk for investors and grow the resourcing pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.

The crisis has revealed that innovation potential was underused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. It has reinforced the idea that [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges|innovation is an important lever]] when facing unprecedented challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. There is a need to invest in new approaches, including supporting partner countries on adoption, exploring innovative financing, and fostering environments like "sandboxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. This requires donors, partner governments, and private investors to work together in new, potentially uncomfortable ways, embracing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.

Another insight is the need to look beyond traditional sector silos, recognizing the holistic impact of crises like COVID-19 on various health areas, the economy, and livelihoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. Finally, there's a global call to broaden the conversation on innovation to include diversity, equity, and inclusion, actively seeking out and encouraging female and locally-based innovators who might not be on the traditional radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Personal and Institutional Commitments

Individuals and institutions are committed to evolving their approaches:
*   **Dr. Jemilah Mahmood**: Personally reinforced belief in planetary health, leading to lifestyle changes and a keen interest in establishing a "planetary health alliance or center" in the Southeast Asian region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.
*   **Professor Jaideep Prabhu**: Rethinking education by actively "going to students" using digital means, fostering entrepreneurship, and shifting from lecturing to listening and connecting young people who want to make change in their societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>.
*   **Amy Lynn**: Committed to intentionally enabling female and locally-based innovators, ensuring a broader conversation on innovation and global health, and actively seeking and examining how decisions and priorities are set to enable the most inclusive innovation environment possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

The head of the Development Cooperation Directorate at the OECD is personally committed to supporting scaled-up work on [[role_of_innovation_in_sustainable_urban_development|innovation for development]] within the DAC, making it a priority for the next biennium to continue dialogue and mobilize the full potential of development cooperation to support and enable innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:54">[01:08:54]</a>.

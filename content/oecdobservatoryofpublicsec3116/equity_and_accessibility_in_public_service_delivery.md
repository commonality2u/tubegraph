## Introduction
The OECD and its partners are committed to building trust in public institutions by improving the quality of public services, recognizing that people's experiences with government services profoundly influence their perception of government responsiveness and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This commitment underpins the work to make governments more effective and [[impact_of_inequality_on_access_to_government_services | equitable]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Understanding Sludge in Public Services
Sludge refers to "unjustified frictions that really make it harder to access and use public services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. While the term "sludge" is relatively new, the burden it describes is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The concept applies a behavioral lens to conversations previously focused on administrative burdens or user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Characteristics of Sludge
Most sludging in government is often unintentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Common examples include:
*   Information that is hard to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   Processes that are hard to understand or complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   Very long waiting times without updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   Complex decision points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Psychological Costs
A key value of focusing on sludge is its emphasis on psychological costs, which are often difficult to quantify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. These costs include:
*   **Search costs** When people struggle to find information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Decision costs** Experienced when evaluating options, especially close ones, leading to psychological overload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Cognitive costs** The mental resources needed to fulfill requirements or understand complex information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This refers to the "brain capital" used to overcome unclear information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   **Emotional costs** Such as experiencing stress, feeling disempowered, anxious, or frustrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### Disproportionate Impact on Vulnerable Populations
Sludge disproportionately affects [[impact_of_inequality_on_access_to_government_services | vulnerable populations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, who are most reliant on public services and most likely to suffer psychological burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. [[impact_of_inequality_on_access_to_government_services | Vulnerable people]] include not only specific groups but also individuals at different, challenging times in their lives, such as during natural disasters or childbirth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

Behavioral science explains why sludge is particularly challenging for vulnerable individuals:
*   **Unrealistic optimism** Can prevent people from seeing the challenges sludge presents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.
*   **Procrastination** May lead to delaying engagement with sludge responsibilities indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.
*   **Present bias** Where immediate concerns overshadow future ones, making sludge a severe hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.
*   **Cognitive scarcity** When people are ill, poor, or struggling, sludge becomes especially challenging to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>. For example, a study on evictions found that proximity to the courthouse affects outcomes, demonstrating how difficult it is for people to navigate the sludge of physical distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>.

## The Sludge Audit Method
To identify and address frictions in government services, the OECD partnered with the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Customer Service to develop and pilot the sludge audit method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. The NSW sludge audit method has been used for four years and has had a significant impact on services in New South Wales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

### Unique Aspects of the NSW Method
The method aims to integrate behavioral science insights with customer feedback to systematically identify and quantify sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. It focuses on four key metrics:
*   Time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   Cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   Effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   Inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

The "effort and inclusion" components are particularly unique, as they codify behavioral science evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

### International Sludge Academy (ISA)
The first International Sludge Academy (ISA) was launched in 2022 to pilot the NSW methodology outside Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   22 countries expressed interest, and 16 teams from 14 countries were selected to conduct parallel sludge audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   Countries received master classes and one-on-one mentorship from NSW colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   The ISA demonstrated that governments globally are eager to reduce sludge, auditing a diverse range of processes, including citizen-facing public services and internal government processes like HR services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

#### Case Studies from the ISA
*   **France (Assistance for Independent Living - APA)**: The French Behavioral Insights team applied the sludge audit to the APA application process, which helps elderly people receive aid to stay at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. The administration reported high dropout rates due to complexity and inconsistent application versions across territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. The audit involved interviewing 20 people across nine departments (caregivers, applicants, professionals) and reviewing existing forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. This revealed psychological costs and abandonment points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. The process allowed for user-centric, objective, and multi-dimensional analysis, emphasizing [[impact_of_inequality_on_access_to_government_services | inequality]] and [[inclusive_digital_participation_and_accessibility | inclusion]] issues beyond just language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. It also empowered the administration to perform autonomous diagnoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.
*   **Brazil (Go.br Account Recovery)**: Brazil audited the recovery process for the Go.br account, the main entry point to over 4,000 [[digital_transformation_and_inclusion_in_public_services | digital services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. While the automated recovery process with facial recognition is well-designed for some, a more costly and difficult online form recovery process exists for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. This impacts over 100 million recovery requests annually, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Brazil is developing its own adapted tool and methodology, focusing on recognizing different user journeys and integrating an [[impact_of_inequality_on_access_to_government_services | equity]] check to identify who needs more guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. The goal is a self-applied tool for federal, state, and municipal governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. Sludge audits are seen as a good entry point for behavioral insights in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a> and a crucial way to promote [[inclusive_services_and_public_policy_making | inclusiveness]], [[impact_of_inequality_on_access_to_government_services | equity]], and public perception of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

## Principles for Assessing and Preventing Sludge
From the first ISA, nine key principles were identified to support governments in conducting sludge audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>:
1.  **Control over Change**: Prioritize audits where the team has sufficient control to implement solutions, ensuring the audit translates into actual changes in user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Sludge audits can also be valuable for making a business case for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
2.  **Standardized Methodology**: Using a predefined, common methodology that has been tested in different contexts provides rigor, reliability, and allows for replication and comparisons across time and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.
3.  **Tailored Audits**: Accommodate complex behavioral journeys and non-linear government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
4.  **Equity Lens**: It is crucial to deploy an [[impact_of_inequality_on_access_to_government_services | equity lens]] throughout the sludge audit process, considering how sludge disproportionately affects underserved communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. This might involve focusing the audit specifically on the experience of an underserved community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
5.  **Evaluating Progress**: Translate sludge audits into tangible changes on the ground, using behavioral frameworks to improve services, and re-auditing to measure the impact of changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
6.  **System Enablers**: Successful sludge prevention programs benefit from:
    *   Government commitment to improving user services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
    *   Close connection between the audit team and service owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.
    *   Access to systematically collected customer survey data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

## Future Directions and Recommendations
The OECD is committed to leading in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.
*   **International Comparisons**: There is significant benefit in conducting international comparisons of sludge findings across similar processes and jurisdictions to build a collective evidence base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.
*   **OECD Recommendation**: The OECD is developing an international standard on [[inclusive_services_and_public_policy_making | human-centered public administrative services]], emphasizing making services work for people beyond just efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
*   **International Sludge Academy 2.0**: Building on the first ISA's success, future academies will emphasize peer learning and methodological development. They will also open to a broader set of teams beyond behavioral science, including program, policy, and [[innovation_in_public_service_delivery | service delivery]] teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. Benchmarking common processes like passport renewal across countries is also a goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

Ultimately, sludge reduction is not just about administrative efficiency, but about reshaping public services to be more [[impact_of_inequality_on_access_to_government_services | equitable]], [[inclusive_digital_participation_and_accessibility | accessible]], and trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. By eliminating unnecessary burdens, governments can give people more of what they need: time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.

> "Measurement does not generate magic. Yes, do sludge audits, and don't stop there. Your action in response to audits... is what's going to create better services, better government, better outcomes, and a better world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>

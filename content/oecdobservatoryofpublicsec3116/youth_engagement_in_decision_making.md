## The Future Mentors Program

The City of Espoo, Finland, has implemented the "Future Mentors Program" to foster [[youth_and_intergenerational_justice_in_shaping_future_missions | youth and intergenerational justice in shaping future missions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. This initiative is a reversed mentoring program where a group of young people mentor a [[decision_making | decision maker]] from their own city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>. The program's core purpose is to bridge the gap between youth and local-level decision makers, creating dialogue and mutual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>. The rationale is that since current decisions have a lasting impact on the future of today's youth, they should have a voice in these discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>.

### Program Structure and Themes

Mentoring sessions are led by the young "future mentors" and concentrate on themes that are important to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a>. These young mentors are tasked with contemplating their hopes, dreams, and fears regarding the sustainable future of their home city, which they then discuss with their mentee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>.

The process for the program involves:
*   Young people applying to the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:00">[26:45:00]</a>.
*   Conducting a small pre-research among local youth to gain wider perspectives on their hopes and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51:00">[26:51:00]</a>.
*   Working on their ideas before engaging in dialogue with the [[decision_making | decision maker]] during mentoring sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>.
*   Each city involved appoints a coordinator to facilitate the process and support the young mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>.
*   During the pilot phase, a virtual platform was established for networking and peer support among mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:19:00">[27:19:00]</a>, alongside online sessions with sustainable development experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:27:00">[27:27:00]</a>.

The program can operate at a city, national, or international level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>. An international level adds broader perspective and peer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:00">[27:48:00]</a>. In their pilot, one mentor from each participating city attended the Eurocities conference in Espoo to further develop topics with city leaders and integrate youth perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>.

A "Future Mentors Manual" provides detailed instructions for running the program locally, along with communication materials and results from the pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:00">[28:36:00]</a>.

### Pilot Results and Recommendations

The first round of the program included:
*   94 mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>
*   26 cities from the Eurocities Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>
*   26 decision makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>
*   26 coordinators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>

During the program, youth discussed their dreams and fears concerning the future of cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>. Common topics among their dreams included [[civic_participation_challenges | participation]], public transport, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>. Their fears often revolved around the climate crisis, unemployment, inequality, and poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03:00">[30:03:00]</a>.

At the Eurocities conference, the youth presenters put forth six key recommendations for involving young people at local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. These recommendations were:
*   Compulsory and non-tokenistic youth [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | engagement]] in decisions affecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:47:00">[30:47:00]</a>.
*   Creation of a youth department or university to ensure young people are consistently part of the university's network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:54:00">[30:54:00]</a>.
*   Regular communication (at least twice a year) between city leaders and youth representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>.
*   Inclusive and accessible [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | engagement]] with young people, with special attention to those from disadvantaged backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:00">[31:09:00]</a>.
*   Sufficient resources to support youth and youth organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>.
*   Constant evaluation and feedback gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:22:00">[31:22:00]</a>.

Feedback indicated that both mentors and mentees were generally satisfied with the program's execution, considering it an effective way to involve young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:00">[31:35:00]</a>. Mentors praised the low barrier to participation and the opportunity for youth to express their views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:49:00">[31:49:00]</a>. Mentees found the program an effective way to give young people a voice in [[decision_making | decision-making]] and appreciated the positive and respectful dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:00">[32:11:00]</a>.

### Impact and Future

The program has already demonstrated impact, leading to the establishment of a youth council in at least one instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:00">[32:36:00]</a>. Participating cities (93%) expressed interest in continued collaboration on youth participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. The Future Mentors Program was also shortlisted for the Finnish National Education Agency's "best youth participation practices" for the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:52:00">[32:52:00]</a>, receiving praise for allowing young participants to decide on the themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:03:00">[33:03:00]</a>. All necessary materials for running the program are freely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:08:00">[33:08:00]</a>, and at least one city has already organized a program following the pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:14:00">[33:14:00]</a>.

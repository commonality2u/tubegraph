The International Conference on Governments Beyond Recovery and Towards the Future Fit Public Sector explores opportunities for public governance as the world emerges from crises, inviting exploration into how innovation, adaptation, [[Strategic Foresight in Public Policy | strategic foresight]], and co-creation can shape a better future for governments, societies, and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The conference is hosted by the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU, the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, and the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA), with support from the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Need for a Future-Fit Public Sector

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted new and old challenges for the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. According to the Prime Minister of Slovenia, Janez Janša, two crucial aspects for tackling such challenges are preparedness and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. While some countries were well-prepared due to past experiences or taking recommendations seriously, many, including Slovenia, missed opportunities and struggled with initial responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. The early European response was characterized by chaos, but subsequent phases of recovery and vaccine development became a success story due to coordination and financial support for science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

The pandemic underscores the need for democracies to be more resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. Digital transformation, for example, can significantly improve response times and targeting if data is readily available and shared across countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

### Learning from the COVID-19 Crisis
The pandemic serves as a call to awareness, urging better preparedness for future situations and taking warning signals seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. Without this, societies could face prolonged struggles that fundamentally change them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

Marco Ongaro, Director General of the EIPA, noted that while the world navigated one of its craziest crises, lessons were learned to improve future responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. He emphasized that the crisis showed the importance of thinking differently, as traditional approaches were insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.

Confidence in governments' ability to face complex challenges is somewhat balanced among the public, with a slight majority leaning towards optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. This confidence, however, varies across countries and is influenced by trust in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.

## Core Pillars for Future Preparedness

### Innovation and Adaptation
Petra Majdic, a former cross-country skiing champion, highlighted the importance of innovation and adaptation, especially for smaller entities with fewer resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Her experience showed that "dare to be different" is an opportunity, not a handicap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Continuous adaptation is crucial; her business career was unaffected by COVID-19 because her sports career instilled the need to be adaptive, constantly facing unexpected changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. She stressed the importance of never taking the status quo for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

Mr. Ongaro reiterated the importance of adapting to unknown situations, drawing a parallel to how children are like "human chameleons" capable of constant change, while adults often become afraid of failing and lose flexible, innovative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

For governments, the public sector needs to strategically embed [[Strategic foresight and innovation in government | innovation and foresight]] at the heart of policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a>. This commitment is central to the OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation, adopted by 43 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>. Slovenia, for example, adapted by passing swift legislative packages to address pandemic challenges, circumventing common procedures to act quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>.

### Teamwork and Inclusion
Majdic emphasized that despite cross-country skiing being an individual sport, success was always about "we and us," highlighting the importance of a dependable team built on trust and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This team support was critical when she won an Olympic medal with five broken ribs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Mr. Ongaro stressed that "people" are the key actors driving changes, reorganization, and innovation, both among citizens and within public administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. He advocated for greater [[Integrating strategic foresight into organization and governance | inclusion]] in public administration, recognizing the vital role of often "invisible" professions (e.g., nurses, truck drivers) during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. He suggests that the voice of these people should be heard, and recruitment in public administration should prioritize skills like adaptability and change management over rote knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.

### Integrity and Values
Petra Majdic stated that integrity has always driven her through tough situations, from being a top athlete to a successful businesswoman, and she believes it is a value that all should follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>.

## Tackling Future Global Challenges

### Climate Change
The pandemic was a sharp and urgent crisis, while climate change is a longer-term, less immediate threat in its visibility and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. However, the lessons from COVID-19 regarding quick reaction, adaptability, and the ability to think differently are also relevant for longer-term challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>.

Matthias Corman, Secretary-General of the OECD, emphasized the need for more ambitious and globally coordinated action on climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>. This includes access to better data on policy effort and impact, and a more coherent, globally coordinated approach to pricing emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>. The aim is effective and fair action that leads to global emission reduction without shifting burdens or creating trade tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.

Prime Minister Janša stated that climate change requires a global solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. The biggest answer lies in [[Strategic foresight and innovation in government | innovation]], particularly investing in technologies that produce clean energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. Challenges include the scarcity of materials like lithium for batteries and the need for new material inventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. Public sectors must secure sufficient resources for these massive investments, which often divert funds from other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>. The trust in science is crucial for public support of such investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>.

### Digital Transformation and Cybersecurity
The accelerating digital transformation offers opportunities but also growing risks and disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. Key areas include ensuring equitable access to digital infrastructure, investing in skills development, planning for the future of work, and addressing competition issues, cybersecurity, privacy, and cross-border data flow with trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. It also involves setting values-based standards, such as for artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

A significant future challenge highlighted is the potential for a serious cyberattack to occur simultaneously with a pandemic, which would severely impact the public sector's ability to react, especially without digital tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:09">[01:30:09]</a>.

## The Path Forward: Cooperation and Continuous Learning

Greater cooperation between European Union countries is essential for facing future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. The EU possesses a "huge treasure" of existing answers to various problems within its member countries, which is not yet fully exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. Bureaucratic obstacles and barriers often hinder the sharing of this knowledge and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>.

Mr. Ongaro believes that public administrations should change how they advise and train member states, moving towards bringing people together to share knowledge and learn from each other, rather than "reinventing the wheel" in every country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>. This includes initiatives like the Common Assessment Framework (CAF) and the European Public Sector Award, supported by organizations like the OECD and the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.

Prime Minister Janša emphasized the need for Europe to create a society that is [[Strategic foresight and innovation in government | innovation-friendly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:45">[01:21:45]</a>. The challenge is not the availability of knowledge and information in the modern world, but how to use it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>. Citizens, from kindergarten onward, need to be taught how to use information, how to judge, and how to prioritize, developing the skills to use information for good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:22:17]</a>.

This commitment to continuous learning and collaboration will help governments to better prepare for and shape the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>.

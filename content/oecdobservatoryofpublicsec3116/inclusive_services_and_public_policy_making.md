The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical importance of public trust for the effectiveness of public policies, ranging from compliance with restrictions to vaccine uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. During the crisis, public services often adapted using [[digital_transformation_and_inclusion_in_public_services|digital technologies]] to keep citizens safe and meet their expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. However, a significant risk, observed in past crises like the global financial crisis, is that some citizens may feel alienated or left behind, particularly when public services fail to reach them or meet their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## Drivers of Public Trust

Trust in public institutions is primarily driven by the responsiveness and reliability of services, as well as perceptions of their fairness, openness, and integrity. This concept is encapsulated in the OECD's trust framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

Key factors that contribute to building trust and fostering [[equity_and_accessibility_in_public_service_delivery|inclusive services]] include:
*   **Effective Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>:
    *   Governments that communicate timely and clearly about necessary actions, even difficult ones, see citizens following guidelines and an increase in the perception of government performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.
    *   Clear communication can improve mental health during times of crisis and uncertainty by providing guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.
    *   Telling "difficult truths" by leaders can be more effective than downplaying problems, as it increases trust and performance perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:21:00">[38:21:00]</a>. Simplicity in communication is also vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:46:00">[39:46:00]</a>.
*   **Local-Level Engagement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>:
    *   The importance of local leaders, community-based policies, and community trust is evident in successful pandemic responses, such as in Bangladesh and Sierra Leone, where collaboration with communities led to better adherence to measures and vaccination rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
    *   The local level is fundamental for building trust because it's where individuals, especially those not typically included nationally, participate most and have greater awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>. Communication is also easier at this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:10:00">[42:10:00]</a>.
*   **"Humble Government" Approach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:04:00">[51:04:00]</a>:
    *   This involves acknowledging what is unknown, accepting limitations, publicly recognizing gaps in knowledge, and having the humility to ask for help from citizens and other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:16:00">[51:16:00]</a>.
    *   It also means being more flexible and listening more, moving away from rigid, law-centric approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:40:00">[52:40:00]</a>.

## Challenges to Inclusivity in Public Policy

Despite efforts to adapt, the pandemic has exposed and exacerbated several challenges to fostering [[inclusive_and_accessible_democratic_participation|inclusive services]] and building trust:
*   **Increased Distance Between Citizens and Governments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>:
    *   Research in Spain showed a drop in both external and internal political efficacy during the pandemic, indicating citizens felt the political system was less open to their needs and they had less capacity to influence politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.
*   **Gender Inequality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>:
    *   Women's perceived political efficacy, already lower, decreased more significantly than men's during the pandemic, widening the gap and potentially hampering [[inequality_and_public_policy|gender equality]] in politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide and [[inclusive_digital_participation_and_accessibility|Digital Exclusion]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>:
    *   While [[digital_transformation_and_inclusion_in_public_services|digitalization]] has enabled swift service delivery (e.g., unemployment benefits), it also creates a gap for vulnerable groups like indigenous people and the elderly who may be left out, worsening existing inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21:00">[32:21:00]</a>.
    *   Online participation often reproduces offline inequalities, with the same groups being less active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:00">[31:13:00]</a>.
*   **Misinformation and Polarization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>:
    *   The crisis has intensified societal divisions and polarization, often fueled by misinformation spread through social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>.
    *   The proliferation of individual media platforms makes it challenging for governments to maintain a fact-based discussion, risking policies becoming reactive rather than strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.
    *   Governments face a dilemma between engaging on social media and allowing other actors to fill that space, potentially spreading misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Long-Term Vision and Leadership** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>:
    *   A perceived lack of vision and leadership hinders governments from moving beyond old ways, with many believing lessons from previous crises like the 2008 financial crisis have not been fully learned to build more [[inequality_and_public_policy|inclusive economies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:28:00">[49:28:00]</a>.
    *   Political cycles often prioritize short-term gains over long-term policy making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>.
*   **Siloed Government Operations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26:00">[28:26:00]</a>:
    *   Competition between government sectors and ministries, each representing different interests, can lead to competing interests within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>.
    *   This necessitates greater [[intergovernmental_cooperation_and_policy_integration|coordination between different sectors]] and levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:35:00">[55:35:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Building Inclusive Services and Trust

To build more inclusive services and policies, several strategies are proposed:
*   **[[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services|Innovative Policy Making Tools]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>:
    *   **Co-creation processes:** Engaging different groups of people, places within countries, and public institutions to reach consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Design thinking in policy making:** Centering policy design around the people who use and serve the policies, fostering collaboration and understanding among stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>. This method, once learned, becomes integral to policy design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:24:00">[46:24:00]</a>.
*   **Empowering Public Employees:** Changing internal government processes to empower public employees, give them ownership, and ensure their understanding of challenges in delivering public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:53:00">[57:53:00]</a>.
*   **Diverse Engagement Mechanisms:** Recognizing that citizens desire different types of relationships with government, and offering various participation mechanisms that are simple enough to encourage engagement from a broad spectrum of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:05:00">[41:05:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Community Structures:** Instead of creating new mechanisms, governments should identify and utilize existing ways communities and citizens already engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:54:00">[43:54:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Feedback and Adaptability:** Public services should be designed as continuous systems, where feedback from users is regularly collected and integrated into the design process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:51:00">[48:51:00]</a>.
*   **Developing New Skills for Public Servants:** Public servants need a broader skill set to master various instruments, including big data analysis, ethnographic interviews, user experience design, and quick survey tools, to better understand and interact with society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>.

## Practical Tools for Engagement and Empathy

Two simple but highly effective tools were highlighted for fostering engagement and understanding:
1.  **One Plus Two Plus Four:** A discussion facilitation method where participants first think alone, then discuss in pairs, and only then engage in larger groups. This ensures all participants feel their opinions are heard and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
2.  **Empathy Maps:** Stakeholder groups are asked to articulate what they believe other groups think about them. This exercise reveals misperceptions, opens dialogue, and builds trust by allowing participants to empathize with different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

Building more inclusive public policy tools and institutions not only leads to better services but also empowers citizens and strengthens public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. This requires a shift towards [[leadership_and_collaboration_in_public_service|leadership]] that embraces humility, flexibility, and a long-term vision beyond electoral cycles.

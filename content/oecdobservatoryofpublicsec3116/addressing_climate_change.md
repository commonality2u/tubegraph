Governments today face significant [[challenges_in_addressing_climate_change | challenges]] due to the extraordinary pace and complexity of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It has become clearer than ever that governments must adopt new and innovative approaches to [[addressing_complex_challenges_like_climate_change_and_aging_populations | address society's biggest problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These problems include [[challenges_in_addressing_climate_change | climate change]], infectious diseases, and digital disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Role of the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation works to place [[innovation_and_technology_in_climate_mitigation | innovation]] at the core of government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Their efforts include:
*   Empowering public servants with new insights, tools, and connections to explore new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Conducting cutting-edge research to identify emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Collaborating with leading experts to offer trusted advice and integrate new practices into standard operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

This work extends globally, reaching both OECD countries and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. While governments are certain to face more [[challenges_in_addressing_climate_change | challenges]] in the future, collaborative efforts can enable them to anticipate and act effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. By working together, it is possible to support the development of better and more innovative policies, ultimately leading to improved lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

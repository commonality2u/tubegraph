[[Anticipatory innovation]] is a crucial facet of public sector innovation that is often systematically underinvested [02:06:06]. It involves putting mechanisms and structures into governments to enable sustainable work [02:32:00]. The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) focuses on building capacity in this area, working with governments to understand what it takes to implement [[Anticipatory innovation]] effectively in practice [02:11:00][03:38:00].

## Context in Different Countries

### Chile
Chile recently established a Ministry of Science, Knowledge, Technology, and Innovation, which published its first national policy in October 2020 [02:12:00]. This policy emphasizes [[Anticipatory innovation]] as a central area, aiming to articulate actors to find local answers to global challenges concerning the future [02:40:00]. While there are several initiatives in diverse public sector organizations focusing on innovation policy, they are not yet organized as a system of [[Anticipatory innovation]] [02:17:00][02:29:00]. This results in a lack of political agreement, sufficient funding, and the necessary multidisciplinary technical skills [02:36:00][02:51:00]. Less than 20% of public funding in Chile for science, knowledge, technology, and innovation is invested in facing the future in an organized way [04:51:00]. Civil servants are actively working to establish this capacity within the Chilean state [02:53:00][02:49:00].

### Denmark
Denmark has a long history of [[Role of innovation in public administration|public sector innovation]], with eight out of ten public sector workplaces implementing innovation within the last two years [02:10:00][02:22:00]. A significant portion (nine out of ten) of these innovations are connected to core activities, demonstrating a strong, bottom-up, citizen-centric approach [02:30:00][02:35:00]. However, this success can lead to complacency [02:39:00]. According to an OPSI innovation scan, while Denmark is strong in enhancement and [[Role of adaptive innovation in government services|adaptive innovation]], [[Anticipatory innovation]] and mission-oriented innovation remain weak spots [02:52:00][02:58:00]. Key questions for Denmark include whether a new toolkit is needed, how to ensure relevance to users, and how [[Anticipatory innovation]] connects to other approaches [05:03:00][05:22:00][05:39:00]. The focus is on complex challenges like climate change and social inequalities, which inherently have a future-oriented nature [03:10:00][03:16:00].

### Slovenia
Slovenia is undertaking a study on age and talent management in the public sector, addressing demographic changes where a significant portion of the population will be over 65 by 2050 [03:01:00][03:06:00]. This study serves as a trigger to tackle the issue using an [[Anticipatory innovation]] approach, providing time and space to think about future possibilities, something typically lacking [03:30:00][03:52:00]. The Ministry of Public Administration's HR team and the innovation team are collaborating, learning by doing on concrete cases [03:20:00][03:49:00]. This bottom-up approach aims to prove the value of new practices to leadership and politicians, despite the challenge of political changes impacting support [03:53:00][04:00:00][04:03:00].

## Barriers to Getting Started with Anticipatory Innovation
OPSI's work identifies five broad categories of barriers, collectively termed "the impact gap," which prevent excellent foresight work from being implemented [03:51:00][03:56:00][03:57:00]:

*   **Competency Barriers:** Strategic foresight is not universally embedded in governments, often existing only in pockets of excellence [03:41:00][03:50:00].
*   **Cultural Barriers:** Unreasonable expectations that foresight will reveal the future like an oracle, or that experts can provide perfect, clairvoyant knowledge [03:59:00][03:09:00].
*   **Cognitive Barriers:** Difficulty grasping complexity, uncertainty, and exponential change, leading to avoidance of uncertainty, groupthink, recency/availability bias, and a lack of imagination about future possibilities [03:56:00][04:09:00].
*   **Corporate Barriers:** Organizations may cling to implicit, outdated "zombie futures" that are no longer in step with a fast-changing reality, hindering their ability to keep up with disruptions [04:01:00][04:18:00].
*   **Communication Barriers:** Challenges in effectively communicating diverse perceptions of the future within an organization, leading to implicit assumptions that can result in surprises when not addressed [04:51:00][04:54:00].

## Needs of Civil Servants to Embrace Anticipatory Innovation
To embrace [[Anticipatory innovation]], civil servants need:
*   The motivation and urge to build multidisciplinary and collaborative solutions [04:40:00][04:47:00][04:44:00].
*   An understanding that future scenarios are collective agreements, not individual predictions [04:44:00][04:47:00].
*   The ability to generate political agreement and secure funding for long-term initiatives [04:06:00][04:10:00].
*   Access to diverse technical and multidisciplinary knowledge to build solutions [04:16:00][04:19:00].
*   Dedicated projects and funds for training and expert assistance to prove that different approaches work [04:20:00][04:23:00].
*   Strong motivation and "soft skills" like collaboration and co-creation [04:32:00][04:39:00].
*   A "safe environment" with an embedded system and tools, so the work doesn't solely depend on the willingness of individual civil servants or political cycles [04:55:00][04:59:00].
*   The ability to continuously question existing paradigms [05:54:00].
*   Tangible and concrete tools that provide real value, avoiding abstract concepts [05:22:00][05:33:00].
*   Guidance on when and how to use specific tools, and how they connect to other innovation approaches [05:51:00][05:56:00].
*   Stimulation of abilities like imagination, boldness, and prospection through practical engagement [05:44:00][05:56:00].
*   The willingness to learn from the future, imagine alternatives, and foster responsible innovation and sustainable societies [05:23:00][05:28:00][05:30:00].

## [[Anticipatory innovation for governments|Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit]] and its Limitations
Portugal's LabX, in collaboration with OPSI, is developing an [[Anticipatory innovation]] starter kit aimed at addressing the pressing need for accessible tools for public managers [04:40:00][04:51:00][05:07:00]. The kit is designed to be user-friendly, supporting a "do-it-yourself" mentality, and actionable, providing concrete changes and value [05:55:00][06:01:00][06:11:00]. It will help translate problems into challenges (e.g., imagining alternative futures, envisioning new visions, setting strategies, understanding drivers of change) and provide tools for tackling them [06:14:00][06:21:00]. The kit aims to be modular, allowing users to adapt it to their reality [01:00:07].

However, the kit is not a panacea [01:02:26]. It is intended as a platform for asking questions and initiating a continuous learning-by-doing process, rather than providing definitive answers or prescriptive solutions [05:59:00][05:52:00][05:56:00]. [[Anticipatory innovation]] and strategic foresight alone do not solve problems; they must lead to action and strategy [01:02:43][01:02:50]. These approaches enlarge the picture but can never complete it, and decision-makers cannot be forced to take notice [01:03:30][01:03:38]. It requires a long and sustained effort to bear fruit, often decades of consistent practice [01:04:24][01:04:37]. Moreover, foresight processes can be unhelpful if they focus excessively on gathering signals without leading to purpose-driven sense-making, strategic reframing, or concrete innovation and experimentation [01:05:00][01:05:26].

## The Political and Values Angle
The integration of [[Anticipatory innovation]] into government work inherently involves public values [01:06:07]. Civil servants are political actors [01:08:44]. The challenge lies in how to agree on a spectrum of possible future scenarios and then for politicians to decide which portions are seen as opportunities or risks, reflecting societal values [01:09:23][01:10:07].

It is crucial to offer the outputs of foresight (scenarios) as a public good, allowing politicians, the productive sector, and academia to respond based on their values and perspectives [01:10:48][01:11:20]. A significant challenge is introducing less linear, more desire-driven thinking about the future into political discourse, which often prioritizes economic, linear approaches [01:12:10][01:13:02].

Addressing political cycles (e.g., three to five years) that clash with the longer time scales of many future problems requires forums for discussing values and the needs of future generations [01:06:51][01:07:06]. Communicating "uncomfortable knowledge" about the future to politicians, even if it's not immediately attention-grabbing, is vital [01:03:58]. Ultimately, persistent communication of results, motivation, and "stubbornly" implementing solutions are crucial to spreading this new culture and demonstrating the value of [[Anticipatory innovation]] [01:14:19][01:14:32][01:14:40]. Co-creation in a transparent way is ideal, though political realities can sometimes hinder transparency [01:15:02][01:15:09].

The OPSI continues to support initiatives like the LabX Portugal incubator project and collaborate with partners such as the Danish Design Center to develop international versions of the [[Anticipatory innovation for governments|Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit]] [01:17:44][01:18:02].

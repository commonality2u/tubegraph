A webinar exploring [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] and how governments can become "future fit" was co-hosted by Josh Polczar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> and Julia Stout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The event was supported by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Defining Anticipatory Innovation and Strategic Foresight

The purpose of the webinar was to examine tangible ways in which public sector organizations detect, understand, and act upon future changes in their present-day work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Terms like "future proof" or "future fit" gain meaning only when organizations actively work in the present to prepare for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

[[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | Strategic foresight]] involves considering multiple alternative futures to imagine what might happen and enable more prepared decisions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This approach is central to the OECD's work and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Within the government context, [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] acknowledges that governments constantly consider the future, but often do not fully utilize available information to better prepare for and shape it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This gap between foresight work and policy impact is referred to as the "impact gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) focuses on bridging this gap by embedding [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] and other anticipatory work into the policy actions of national governments through innovative prototyping and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Importance in Public Policy

The future holds significance for several critical aspects of public policy:
*   **Legitimacy of Policy Decisions** in a democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Addressing Global Challenges** such as climate change and biodiversity loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   Ensuring the **Fast-Moving Digital Transformation** is inclusive and beneficial for well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

[[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | Strategic foresight]] makes a key contribution to strengthening democracy, promoting public trust, taking on climate change, and preparing governments to better serve societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Challenges and Barriers

Implementing [[anticipatory_innovation_in_the_public_sector | anticipatory innovation in the public sector]] faces several challenges:
*   **Organizational Habits**: Precedents, rules, routines, and established practices can hinder change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Culture and Capabilities**: A social environment that is risk-averse or lacks the internal capacity for futures thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   **"What If We Were Wrong?"**: It is difficult for large bureaucratic organizations to entertain the possibility that their existing narratives or plans might be incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. However, events like COVID-19 have demonstrated that disruptions can prove organizations "pretty wrong in a very dramatic, impactful way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Policy Pressure**: Political systems often prioritize immediate policy needs, leading to a focus on the very short-term future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   **Lack of Foresight Literacy**: A "big lack of foresight literacy" in organizations, coupled with a culture of efficiency and quantitative focus, can create barriers for foresight teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
*   **Myth of Best Practice**: Relying on past "best practices" is a "myth" when looking at the future, as there's no guarantee that what worked before will work again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

## The Role of Experimentation

Given the inherent uncertainty of the future, experimentation is a prominent theme in fitting the future into the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   It is impossible to know the future in advance or have all the right answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   Learning and evidence gathering through experimentation are at the heart of public sector innovation and effective, democratic, and sustainable public policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This concept is termed [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   [[anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] is about taking in uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a> without being paralyzed by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   Experimentation is a daily reality in foresight work, as standard methods often need to be combined and tweaked to adapt to diverse contexts and specific policy requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

## Key Initiatives and Programs

### OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI)
OPSI identifies [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] as one of four facets of public sector innovation, alongside mission-oriented, enhancement-oriented, and adaptive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The team focuses on [[anticipatory_innovation_and_engaging_with_the_future | engaging with the future]] by developing new approaches to prototyping that embed [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] work into national governments to bridge the impact gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. OPSI collaborates with governments worldwide, including Finland, Latvia, Slovenia, Ireland, and Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

The EU also conducts training for colleagues across the Commission to improve "foresight literacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. An aspirational goal is to organize a participatory foresight session with the College of the European Commission to explore scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

### Singapore Futures (Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy)
Singapore Futures focuses on the intersection of futures, public policy, and Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The program builds futures and [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] capacity at the school, with interests in how technology, economic, and regulatory policy intersect with capability development and futures thinking for policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

The webinar emphasizes the importance of learning together, experimenting, trying new things, and having the humility to recognize when approaches may be wrong or need adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. The challenge is to design experiments that foster deliberative learning processes between the public sector, academia, and the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

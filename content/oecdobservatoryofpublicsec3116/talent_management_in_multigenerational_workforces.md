The discussion on skills for the future in the public sector highlights the critical need to identify and effectively develop these competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is actively engaged in work concerning the [[future_of_public_employment | future of work in the public service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, focusing on how public services and administrations are preparing for a future that is more digital, flexible, and prone to surprises and crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

A significant portion of this work is dedicated to [[utilizing_and_liberating_talent_in_government | talent management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The OECD, in partnership with Slovenia's Ministry of Public Administration, has conducted a report on [[utilizing_and_liberating_talent_in_government | talent management]] in multi-generational public services, examining examples across European member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Defining Talent in a Shifting Landscape

The definition of "talent" is rapidly changing, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:31]</a>. Public service expectations to deliver are higher than ever, providing an opportunity to reconsider what kind of talent is truly necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:42]</a>.

Beyond identifying necessary skills and talent, it is crucial to:
*   **Integrate them** into the public service through recruitment or development strategies, training, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Ensure they are put to use** effectively once acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:09]</a>.

This ultimately leads to the question of [[role_of_leadership_and_management_in_fostering_innovation | management and leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:19]</a>. Leaders must be able to recognize the need for talent and create an environment where talent can flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Post-COVID Adaptation and the "New Normal"

A poll conducted during the discussion revealed mixed perspectives on public managers' willingness to adapt after the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:56]</a>:
*   **50%** believe managers are willing to acknowledge lessons learned but less willing to change actions and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:56]</a>.
*   **28%** are optimistic, believing managers are willing and ready to learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:10]</a>.
*   **21%** suggest management is eager to return to the pre-COVID "old normal" status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:22]</a>.

This highlights the ongoing challenge of translating lessons learned into concrete action and behavior change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:49]</a>.

### The Shifting Landscape of Work
Peter Pogotar from Slovenia's Ministry of Public Administration notes that while digital technologies have radically changed public administration, skilled and motivated civil servants are key to better government solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:31]</a>. He advocates for an "onward to a new normal" approach, merging successful elements from the old ways with new practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:31:18]</a>. This requires changing the culture of management to focus on results, remunerating efficiency, and encouraging continuous self-development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:46]</a>. Trust-based leadership is seen as crucial for achieving work results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:57]</a>.

[!NOTE]
It is the middle and line management that need to be re-skilled and continuously learn to prepare the civil service for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:53]</a>.

### Organizational Inertia and New Models
Cheryl Chung from Singapore Futures offers a less optimistic view, citing organizational inertia as a barrier to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:39]</a>. She identifies several challenges:
*   **Precedent and Existing Policies**: The reliance on "who has done it before" and strict policy guidelines can hinder new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Competency and Culture**: A limited set of competencies can constrain problem-solving (the "hammer and nail" analogy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:11:18]</a>. Governments struggle to hire diverse talent (e.g., designers vs. economists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:37]</a> and integrate them into existing organizational cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Organizational Habits and Routines**: Fixed routines like budget cycles or meeting schedules can constrain flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:38]</a>.

Chung challenges the assumption of a centralized, top-down leadership model, suggesting a need for more distributed and bottom-up leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:35:12]</a>. This could involve exploring concepts like a "shadow board" of young people to give them power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:33]</a>.

### Key Skills for the Future
Fabiana Scapolo from the European Commission emphasizes the need for public service organizations to adapt quickly and bring innovation into both public service and policy making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:19]</a>. Navigating a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environment requires leaders to develop more soft skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:19:01]</a>.

[!INFO]
Crucial soft skills include:
*   Critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:06]</a>
*   Creative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:09]</a>
*   Teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:10]</a>
*   Empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>
*   Care for each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:27]</a>
*   Adaptation to change and its management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:30]</a>

## Public vs. Private Sector Approaches to Talent Management
Katarina Primovich Ramovez from NIL Ltd, a private sector company, highlights the importance of **trust** as the "glue that connects everything" in an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:26]</a>. Trust, she explains, is not a one-way street but needs to evolve, supporting an "everyone a leader" concept where individuals are empowered to perform their roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:40:09]</a>.

NIL Ltd's approach to new realities involves:
1.  **Dialogue with Employees**: A company-wide survey led to the development of a hybrid working principle, allowing employees to choose where and how often they work, ensuring business continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:42:25]</a>.
2.  **Flexible Working Arrangements**: Discussions include job sharing, concentrated working hours, and flexible working hours to cater to diverse employee needs and life situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:44]</a>.

Daniele Dotto from DG Reform notes that while many principles apply to both public and private sectors, key differences for the public sector include:
*   **Slower Recruitment**: Public sectors are slower to recruit talent to meet emerging needs, requiring strong in-house training capacities and understanding of existing talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:16:30]</a>.
*   **Challenges in New Technology Deployment**: The immense impact of new digital techniques, combined with security dimensions and organizational size, makes rapid deployment more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Accountability and Risk Aversion**: Public organizations, using taxpayer money, face stricter accountability, making managers more cautious about taking risks or deviating from established rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:55]</a>. Senior management must be willing to back up those who take calculated risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:40]</a>.

Cheryl Chung adds that the evolving roles of public and private sectors, especially with private tech giants having vast data insights into citizen behavior, might shift the ability to achieve policy outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:20:20]</a>. This blurs the lines between sectors and raises questions about what should remain public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:57]</a>.

## Learning and Development Strategies for the Future
The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the adoption of digital tools and new ways of working, proving the public sector's adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:47]</a>. The shift is from planning the future based on past events to anticipating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:30]</a>.

### Innovative Learning Tools and Experiences:
*   **"Inequality Walks"**: Singapore Futures conducts "inequality walks" (now adapted online) to train students in observational skills, empathy, and collaborative dialogue, encouraging comfort with the messy nature of policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:59:09]</a>. This approach aims to bring learning to a wider audience and foster a willingness to be uncomfortable in policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:59:09]</a>.
*   **"Near Core" and Centers of Excellence**: NIL Ltd has defined a "near core" that sets minimum standards for digital literacy and information security for every employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:23]</a>. They also developed a "Center of Excellence" as a one-stop store for knowledge sharing between HR and technical teams across different countries, enhancing collaborative training and internal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:02:17]</a>.
*   **"Nil Master Talk"**: This program focuses on practicing soft skills like effective communication, self-leadership, effective meetings, public speaking, and cross-department collaboration, fostering connection in hybrid work environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:03:07]</a>.
*   **Digital Collaboration Platforms**: The European Commission's use of platforms like Mural and Miro has facilitated collective intelligence and engagement, enabling participants to share ideas on an equal level and structure elements more clearly, especially valuable in foresight for policy making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:05:26]</a>.
*   **Fostering Trust and Creativity**: The crisis has shown the importance of managers creating different ways to connect with people and foster trust, moving away from micromanagement towards a social contract based on results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:07:33]</a>. This includes creating conditions for innovation, allowing for mistakes and errors, and abandoning a "blame culture" to foster psychological safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:03">[01:52:05]</a>.

## [[Future Governance and Leadership | Future Governance and Leadership]]
The future calls for leaders who can shift from a "register directive" model to one that creates trust to achieve results, especially with hybrid teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:32]</a>. The importance of leaders who prioritize results over processes and foster innovation by allowing space for errors and psychological safety is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:52:40]</a>. This is crucial for attracting new generations who are more prone to taking risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:17]</a>.

"If people translate they would for you follow you more easily and the teams that have been based on trust work more efficiently than the dreams that things that were based on um i would say hierarchical guidance." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:26]</a>
\- Daniele Dotto, DG Reform

The ultimate goal for the public sector is to renew its image as an attractive workplace through extensive use of digital technologies, remote working, work-life balance, and environmentally friendly practices to gain and retain talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:29]</a>.

This article explores the [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | Role of Strategic Foresight in Policy Making]], focusing on how public sector organizations can effectively use foresight to address future challenges and opportunities.

## Introduction to Anticipatory Innovation
The webinar, co-hosted by Josh Polczar and Julia Stout, focuses on anticipatory innovation and how the future fits into present-day work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The event is part of the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Purpose of Anticipatory Innovation Governance
Marco Daglio, Head of the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, states that the webinar's purpose is to explore tangible ways [[public_sector_and_strategic_foresight | public sector organizations]] detect, understand, and act upon future changes in their current work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. He emphasizes that terms like "future proof" or "future fit" are only meaningful if organizations actively work in the present to prepare for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This goes beyond just knowledge and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Why the Future Matters for Policy
The future is critical for:
*   The legitimacy of policy decisions in a democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   Addressing challenges like climate change and biodiversity loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   Ensuring the fast-moving digital transformation is inclusive and beneficial for well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

[[Strategic foresight and its challenges in implementation | Strategic foresight]] contributes significantly to strengthening democracy, promoting public trust, tackling climate change, and preparing governments to better serve societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The needs of the future must be addressed through present-day work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Integrating the Future into the Present
A key challenge for panelists is discussing how to fit the future into the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Since knowing the future precisely is impossible, considering multiple alternative futures helps in imagining possibilities and making more prepared decisions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### The Role of Experimentation
[[Role of strategic foresight and experimentation | Experimentation]], through learning and evidence gathering, is at the core of [[public_sector_and_strategic_foresight | public sector innovation]] and effective, democratic, and sustainable public policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This approach is what defines "anticipatory innovation governance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation
The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation focuses on four facets of public sector innovation, one of which is anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This work addresses the "impact gap," where governments consider the future but may not fully utilize available knowledge to prepare for and shape it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The team is dedicated to exploring how [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] and other anticipatory work can lead to policy actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. New approaches include prototyping to embed [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | strategic foresight]] work into national governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Challenges and Lessons in Implementing Foresight
Cheryl Chung, Program Director of Executive Education Singapore Futures, discusses the challenges in [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_government_organizations | integrating strategic foresight into government organizations]].

### Organizational Habits and the Myth of Best Practice
Organizational habits significantly impact public policy and futures practice within a policy context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Policies, precedents, rules, routines, and culture can hinder innovation and future thinking, especially in large bureaucratic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

The core question in futures work is "what if we were wrong?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. While all organizations consider the future to some extent, the challenge lies in openly questioning existing narratives and preparing for disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. COVID-19 has reinforced that disruptions exist, highlighting the need for preparedness rather than simply convincing people they might be wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

Applying a longer-term horizon (e.g., a generation instead of six months) can dramatically change the scope of policy options and problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. The goal of futures work is to integrate this longer-term perspective into the innovation process, where [[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | experimentation]] plays a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Futures work aims to allow decision-making despite uncertainty, rather than being paralyzed by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

The "myth of the best practice" is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Relying on past methods or precedents without adaptation for the future is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. When facing the future, often "nobody knows," requiring the design of experiments to facilitate collective learning among the public sector, academia, and the private sector through a deliberative process of testing, observing, and reflecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

## Foresight in the European Commission
Dr. Laurent Bontoux, Senior Foresight Expert in the Joint Research Centreâ€™s Competence Center for Foresight, highlights the unique circumstances of foresight work within the European Commission.

### Dealing with Short-Term Pressures and Misunderstandings
A dominant factor is the strong pressure from policy and political sides for very short-term results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Foresight teams are often misunderstood as crisis response teams, rather than for their core function of horizon scanning and anticipating future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. This misunderstanding, combined with a culture of efficiency and quantitative focus within the Commission, creates barriers for those trying to think ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

### Fostering Foresight Literacy
There is a significant lack of foresight literacy within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. To address this, training courses are offered to colleagues across the Commission to explain what foresight is and how to use it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. The high demand for these courses indicates interest, especially since COVID-19 demonstrated that unexpected events can happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

### Embracing Uncertainty and Experimentation
The aim is to help people become more comfortable with uncertainty, recognizing it doesn't necessarily mean something negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. Foresight helps steer towards positive outcomes and avoid negative ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

Like the "myth of the best practice," foresight practitioners constantly adapt their methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. Due to the diversity of policy contexts and specific requests, every project requires experimentation, combining standard methods in new ways, and adapting to specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. Experimentation is a daily reality in their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

One ambitious idea is to organize a participatory [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | foresight scenario exploration session]] with the College of the European Commission to introduce them to [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | foresight concepts]] and contaminate their thinking with foresight seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

Governments are increasingly looking beyond their borders to develop solutions for global challenges, such as ending pandemics, managing migration, and reducing carbon dependency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis highlighted a lack of preparedness among governments to tackle global challenges and accelerated digital transformation and the pace of [[government innovation practices|innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. In this context, public sector [[public_sector_innovation_methods_and_strategies|innovation]] has become a key tool to collectively address pressing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. However, [[government innovation practices|innovation efforts]] are largely confined to national and local borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Collaborative Research on Cross-Border Innovation

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed Bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation have partnered to determine how [[public_sector_innovation_methods_and_strategies|innovative practices]] can best support cross-border collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Their joint work includes extensive research, a global call for [[government innovation practices|innovation]] to collect insights and practices, and open global workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The first report in their series, "Achieving Cross-Border Government Innovation," launched in October, highlighted that issues facing governments are increasingly complex and trans-boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. It emphasized the need for existing governance mechanisms for [[international_trends_in_governmental_experimentation_and_innovation|international cooperation]] to adapt and leverage new governance structures, including [[government innovation practices|innovative]] governance bodies, horizontal networks, and coordinated systems approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### The Role of Experimentation

The second report, "Surfacing Insights and Experimenting Across Borders," focuses on [[experimentation_and_learning_in_government|experimentation]] as a key mode of [[government innovation practices|innovation]] in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. [[Experimentation and Learning in Government|Experimentation]] is seen as making ideas more realistic and aiding implementation while keeping risk levels manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The success of [[experimentation_and_learning_in_government|experimentation]] within countries has led governments to apply similar approaches in cross-border and global contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

The report includes [[case_studies_in_public_sector_innovation|case studies]], best practices, tools, resources, and recommendations to help governments make progress in surfacing and testing new ideas across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Key Insights from the Report

The report's analysis of 104 [[case_studies_in_public_sector_innovation|case studies]] and 131 other innovative approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>, along with expert workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>, identified common themes in cross-border [[government innovation practices|innovation]].

#### Ground-Up Approaches

The report covers ground-up approaches for surfacing insights and collective intelligence, such as:
*   Challenge initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>
*   Crowdsourcing exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>
*   Democratic citizens' assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>

These methods apply existing approaches in new, transnational ways, scaling them beyond past efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

#### Experimenting and Testing Across Borders

This aspect focuses on testing new ideas and scaling them in a cross-border manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### Deep Space Food Challenge
This is an [[international_trends_in_governmental_experimentation_and_innovation|international collaboration]] between the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. It incentivizes [[government innovation practices|innovation]] in food production technologies to meet the needs of space exploration and address terrestrial needs like reducing food insecurity on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

NASA's approach involves running parallel prize competitions due to legal and policy restrictions on financial awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>. Each government organizes its own, similar challenge, but activities like marketing and outreach are synchronized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>. This approach encourages diverse communities globally to find solutions that address both space and Earth-based food challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.

### Global Innovation Collaborative
This is a network and platform for collaborations among city governments worldwide, including Paris, London, New York, and Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Through this collaborative, cities launch open [[government innovation practices|innovation]] competitions and invite innovators to deploy solutions in local testbeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This has led to more resilient and sustainable cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

During the COVID-19 crisis, the "Creative Cities Challenge" focused on supporting the cultural sector, which was particularly affected by lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. The open call aimed to spotlight [[government innovation practices|innovations]] and reinforce multi-city [[international_trends_in_governmental_experimentation_and_innovation|international collaboration]], particularly leveraging technology and digital platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>. A secondary benefit of open calls is exposing the public sector to the "art of the possible," showcasing the potential of technology for future application in various sectors like housing, transport, and social care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.

### Government Accelerators (UAE)
The UAE Mohammed Bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation aims to cultivate a culture of [[government innovation practices|innovation]] within the government sector through an integrated framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>. The government accelerators program is a tool that accelerates the implementation of [[innovative approaches in public administration|innovative]] ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. It operates on a "100 days or less" model, focusing on piloting solutions within a specific timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>.

The methodology emphasizes empowering frontline employees from relevant entities and fostering collaborative work through a unique governance model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. Upon successful piloting in a specific geographical area or service, the focus shifts to setting up a sustainability team to ensure the solution's longevity and scalability to similar areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. This program, which has been in place for five years in the UAE, is also shared with other countries through the Government Exchange Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.

### 5G Corridors / 5G MOBIX
This [[case_studies_in_public_sector_innovation|case study]] involves experimental ways to test automated vehicles across the EU, into China, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. It focuses on testing in different atmospheres and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

## Fostering Ecosystems and Collective Intelligence

### The UAE's Approach
The UAE's leadership views [[Government innovation motivations|international collaboration]] and assistance as core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. The Government Exchange Program, a continuation of this commitment, facilitates knowledge sharing of UAE-tailored [[government innovation practices|innovations]] like the government accelerator and excellence awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>. This two-way exchange allows for testing UAE tools in different government contexts globally and enhances their own services and tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.

The Mohammed Bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation also created "Ibtaker" (Innovate in Arabic), the first Arab platform for government innovation, aimed at building a generation of Arab innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. It provides interactive educational courses, a knowledge base of global [[government innovation practices|innovations]], articles, and reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>. The center emphasizes "failing faster" and learning from experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>, with a mentality of acceleration, frontline empowerment, leadership buy-in, and creating space to [[experimentation_and_learning_in_government|innovate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>.

Notable initiatives include:
*   **Regulatory Sandboxes:** Allow legislators to work with disruptors to co-write future-proof laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Possibilities:** The first virtual ministry, led by multiple ministers, given permission to disrupt, ask difficult questions, and incubate solutions for systemic impossibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>. It serves as a space for teaming up across federal, local, private, individual, and academic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Moonshot Apprenticeship Program:** Launched in June 2021, uniting young minds, talents, and governments to tackle pressing global challenges, pairing UAE nationals with [[international_trends_in_governmental_experimentation_and_innovation|international]] counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>.
*   **Moonshot Pilot Grant:** A call for the [[international_trends_in_governmental_experimentation_and_innovation|international]] community to test groundbreaking ideas in partnership with the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.
*   **Agile Nations Network:** The UAE joined six other nations to foster [[international_trends_in_governmental_experimentation_and_innovation|global cooperation]] on rulemaking in response to [[government innovation practices|innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48">[01:20:48]</a>.

### NASA's Approach
NASA actively builds [[government innovation practices|innovation]] ecosystems both horizontally (across methods like prize competitions or citizen science) and vertically (mission-focused, like climate change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:13">[01:58:13]</a>. The goal is to reduce barriers to [[government innovation practices|innovation]] by addressing eight key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:25">[01:38:25]</a>:
1.  **Legal and Policy Frameworks:** Understanding that laws can be changed to enable [[government innovation practices|innovation]] (e.g., US laws for prizes and citizen science) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:32">[01:39:32]</a>.
2.  **Shared Infrastructure and Common Platforms:** Platforms like Challenge.gov and Data.gov provide a low-cost, one-stop shop for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:59">[01:39:59]</a>.
3.  **Communities of Practice:** Supporting communities of practitioners who want to learn at various points in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>.
4.  **Budgets:** Budgeting for success, not just for pilots, to ensure ongoing resources for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>.
5.  **Agency Processes:** Addressing internal processes that create barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:13">[01:41:13]</a>.
6.  **Reporting Requirements:** Quantitative and qualitative reporting to ensure accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:17">[01:41:17]</a>.
7.  **External Assessments and Impact Studies:** Embracing an evaluation mindset, even if results are not always positive, to learn and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:26">[01:41:26]</a>.

A prominent example is the **International Space Apps Challenge**, which has been running for 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. It leverages NASA's open data and software, allowing 28,000 participants from 162 countries to solve challenges and prototype solutions during a 48-hour hackathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>. This fosters energy and empowerment by providing a meaningful way for the public to engage with NASA's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.

### London's Approach
The City of London emphasizes collaboration, recognizing it as essential for its strategic authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:51">[01:42:51]</a>. As the first Chief Digital Officer for London, Theo Blackwell established the London Office of Technology and [[government innovation practices|Innovation]] (LOTI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. LOTI, a small team, has had an outsized impact by organizing and curating engagement with London's 32 boroughs, using design thinking and data expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. This has led to numerous projects ranging from electric vehicle charging infrastructure to IoT technology in social care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.

London's experience with open data, while initially championing open publication, revealed a passive approach that alienated users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>. The lesson learned is that simply making data open is not enough; active engagement with the ecosystem is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. Future data platforms will embed users into governance and use open calls to engage diverse data users (universities, businesses, civil society) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>. Investment in teams like LOTI is crucial for curating the ecosystem, building momentum, and making engagement easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

## Future of Government Experimentation and Collaboration

[[Policy experimentation and global challenges|Cross-border government innovation]] is expected to increase due to the inherently cross-border nature of many of today's largest challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>. These challenges cannot be solved within national boundaries, necessitating stronger partnerships, trust, and open collaborative relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:39">[01:25:39]</a>.

Just as global collaboration on vaccine development was institutionalized through entities like Gavi and COVAX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>, similar institutionalization is needed for issues like net-zero emissions, education, health, and poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>. This involves:
*   **Mobilizing diverse ideas:** Through open challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.
*   **Structured [[experimentation_and_learning_in_government|experiments]]:** To test ideas and gather data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>.
*   **Systematic knowledge sharing:** Documenting and embedding discoveries, not just from successes but also failures, to make the whole system more intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.

While multilateral organizations may struggle, the rise of "mini-lateralism" – collaborations among groups of countries around specific tasks – is a promising trend for [[government innovation practices|innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:41">[01:35:41]</a>. Reducing friction and transaction costs in these collaborations is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:05">[01:36:05]</a>. The future will likely see more enthusiasm-driven, potentially "messy" groupings of cities and nations working on similar problems, rather than standardized multilateral bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>.

Ultimately, the most impactful future collaboration will involve:
*   **Inter-sectoral partnerships:** Between public and private sectors, especially for complex issues like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:24">[01:28:24]</a>.
*   **Focus on foundational elements:** Discussions about common standards, data approaches, and shared methodologies for design and [[government innovation practices|innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>.
*   **New institutions:** To support the sharing and scaling of these foundations, reducing the need for constant reinvention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:34">[01:29:34]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has been a significant catalyst for rapid changes in health systems, particularly accelerating the adoption and rethinking of digital health innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This has been observed across various countries, moving much faster than previously thought possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Acceleration of Existing Trends

For many countries, the pandemic has primarily accelerated existing trends in digital health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>. The shift towards digitalization of health service delivery is widely considered "here to stay" due to the investments made during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

Key areas of acceleration include:

*   **Telehealth and Online Consultations**
    *   In **Ireland**, e-health initiatives, including telehealth in GP practices and OPD clinics, were rolled out to address challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. The implementation of electronic transfer of prescriptions, which had previously been resisted, was fast-forwarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.
    *   **Sweden** experienced a "frog leap" in creating a digitalized health system, enabling digital delivery of services for follow-up visits (e.g., for chronic conditions), digital monitoring for home care patients, and renewing pharmaceutical prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Consultations and health information are also leveraging national digital platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
    *   **Israel** saw the pandemic as the "best accelerator of digital health" it had witnessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. Pockets of resistance to digital health, including bureaucratic processes and unionistic worries, were "wiped out in a matter of days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. This led to a rapid transition to online care, leveraging existing digital health infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. The focus quickly shifted to maintaining chronic disease management and proactive preventive medicine remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.
*   **Data Infrastructure and Utilization**
    *   **Korea** leveraged its existing advanced information infrastructure, including a national health insurance system covering 100% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. They developed a national drug utilization system to track drug safety and prescription administration in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This system enabled clinicians to check COVID-19 risk history, including travel history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. A mask distribution system was also developed using purchasing history to combat panic buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Beyond health sectors, credit card and CCTV information were used for epidemiological investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
    *   **Sweden** pooled data from various health data registers during the pandemic, which significantly benefited research and statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>. There is a commitment to continue innovative ways of collecting and using data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>.
*   **Public Engagement Technology**
    *   **Ireland** implemented a COVID-19 tracker tracing app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
    *   **Korea**'s previous experiences, like the MERS crisis in 2015, contributed to building a robust crisis management system and prepared infrastructure for rapid diagnosis and response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

## Rethinking and New Learnings

The crisis has also forced countries to "think outside the boxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>, leading to new directions:

*   **Redesigning Health Systems:** In **Korea**, the reliance on private sector providers prompted a public discussion on redesigning the health system towards a more public sector dominant model, emphasizing human security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. This implies a deeper re-evaluation beyond mere acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Systems and Preparedness:** **Sweden** realized its society was too dependent on timely delivery with insufficient reserves, leading to shortages of PPE and medical equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>. This highlighted the need to build systems that can adapt quickly to new situations and crises, rather than just restoring old storage methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation vs. Digitization:** In **Israel**, the understanding deepened that digital transformation is not simply digitizing broken systems, but rather a "redesign" of care processes augmented by technological capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. This includes moving towards proactive and asynchronous healthcare provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.
*   **Importance of Safety Margins:** **Israel** hopes that governments will realize the economic impact of maintaining a barely sustainable, fully stretched healthcare system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>. The pandemic underscored the need for safety margins within the healthcare system, recognizing that such crises are likely to recur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.

While many digital health trends have been significantly accelerated, the pandemic has also prompted a deeper reconsideration of system design, adaptive capabilities, and the integration of technology into fundamental healthcare processes.

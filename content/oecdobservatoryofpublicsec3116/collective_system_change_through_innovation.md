From: [[oecdobservatoryofpublicsec3116]] <br/> 

The topic of stewarding innovation portfolios for collective system change is gaining interest, particularly for governments facing accelerating change and diversifying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to public sector innovation, and governments are increasingly expected to handle diverse challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Why Innovation Portfolios?

The pace of change is increasing, and the types of problems are diversifying, requiring governments to be adaptable and innovative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Innovation portfolios are considered key to the practice of public sector innovation, as they allow for an intentional approach to managing diverse efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. While there isn't a rigorous or standard practice, emerging patterns are being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## OECD Innovation Facets Model

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) developed an innovation facets model for portfolio management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This framework, developed from work with national, regional, and sub-national governments, broadly describes the purposes of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It's one of many frameworks available, used primarily for clarification, sense-making, and orienting future action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

The model differentiates between four types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>:
*   **Mission-oriented innovation**: Addresses overall challenges and societal goals through a top-down, directed approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation**: Improves existing practices for greater efficiency and widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation**: Responds to new or expressed needs by creating spaces for bottom-up exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation**: Shapes changes by looking at extreme uncertainty and potential future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

This model has been applied in various contexts, including:
*   Sweden (Vinnova) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
*   Asian Pacific national statistics offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
*   Montenegro, focusing on crisis response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>
*   Norway, examining the relationship between projects and support structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   Gipuzkoa, Spain, focusing on experimentation spaces and supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>

This portfolio reflection process, which clarifies existing activities and their purposes, is the first step in understanding how to transition a portfolio and measure its outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Research Questions and Challenges
Current research on innovation portfolios explores several key questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>:
*   What led to the current portfolio, considering policy context, organizational environment, and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>?
*   Who is stewarding the portfolio, explicitly or implicitly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>?
*   Are there strategies and policies supporting each innovation facet, and what are they <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>?
*   Is the current balance of the portfolio indicative of a temporary or long-term trend, and is it supportive of the overall organizational remit or public purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>?
*   What roles do different [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation | ecosystem actors]] play in shaping the portfolio, and what roles are needed for its stewardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>?

The key question is whether an organization is satisfied with its current mix of innovative activity and what mix *should* exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This "should" question often relates to political choices and which public values are prioritized, making [[challenges_of_organizational_change_for_innovation | legitimacy]] particularly important in a collective environment where no single entity has absolute control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## Emerging Practices and Stewardship

Innovation tends to pull a system in different directions, potentially threatening its coherence and compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. The need for innovation continuously changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. While no one can completely control an innovation system, some form of [[managing_innovation_in_complex_environments | stewardship at the collective level]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

Key areas of emerging practice include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>:
*   **Appreciating space for transition**: Gaining legitimacy for new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Analysis and decision-making support**: Capacity questions related to who holds the overview and provides impulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
*   **Portfolio-level impact assessment**: Holistic and differentiated support structures for diverse innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Diverse capabilities and integrator roles**: Connecting fragmented activities to the core business or community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.
*   **Cooperation structures and knowledge sharing systems**: For ongoing sense-making and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

Most often, multiple actors affect a portfolio, extending beyond organizational borders into a [[public_and_private_collaboration in innovation | multi-stakeholder environment]] or [[managing_innovation_in_complex_environments | ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. The challenge is advancing work where absolute control is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

## Case Study: Viable Cities (Sweden)

Viable Cities is a program with the mission of achieving climate-neutral cities by 2030 with a good life for all within planetary boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. It operates with a mission-oriented portfolio focusing on impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>. Funded by three Swedish [[government_innovation_and_adaptation | government agencies]] (Vinnova, Swedish Energy Agency, Formas) with a budget of 100 million euros over 12 years, it has 100 member organizations representing the quadruple helix (companies, public organizations, academia, civil society) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.

The main purpose of their portfolio strategy is to align climate transition and sustainability efforts for greater impact, adopting a holistic and [[systems_thinking_in_innovation | systemic view]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. This addresses fragmentation and "projectification" in research, innovation, and implementation, providing the necessary directionality and reflexivity for [[system_thinking_and_transformative_change | systemic solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

A flagship effort is "Climate Neutral Cities 2030," where initially nine Swedish cities and their partners are pioneering climate transition acceleration efforts, expanding to 20 cities later this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

The **Climate City Contract** is a core tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. This negotiated document assigns commitments to both national-level government agencies and the cities, signed by mayors and director generals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. It is revised and signed yearly, stewarding ownership and commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.

**Transition Labs** accelerate learning for climate transition, helping cities and stakeholders clarify common direction, leverage synergies, renew decision-making, and build dynamic capabilities for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. They also work on [[managing_innovation_in_complex_environments | innovation management]] for [[system_thinking_and_transformative_change | transformative systems change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

Key learnings from Viable Cities include:
*   **"Portfolio of portfolios" concept**: To achieve their mission, efforts across different actors and governance levels must be aligned and connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>. This involves creating "open interfaces" between portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.
*   **Centrality of city-level portfolios**: Due to the mission, city-level portfolios are central, though this principle can adapt based on the specific mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>.
*   **Collaboration examples**:
    *   Aligning with other national strategic innovation programs like "Drive Sweden" to connect efforts and resources for climate neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.
    *   The international **Climate Smart Cities Challenge**, an attempt to learn across geographical borders and experiment with new portfolio strategies like defining challenges and designing system demonstrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.
*   **Sense-making process**: Since it's an emerging practice, critical discussion is needed to redefine what a "transformative portfolio" means in new collaborative contexts, moving beyond just portfolios of projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. They explore "portfolio of what?" by including challenges, needs, and barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>.

## Case Study: Future by Lund (Sweden)

Future by Lund is an innovation platform within the Municipality of Lund, functioning as an experiment in progress for portfolio stewardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>. It's a multi-stakeholder environment connecting companies, organizations, city departments, universities, and faculties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.

Their philosophy is built on trust, negotiation, and timing, accepting fragmentation and dynamism where no one controls others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. They use a "Zone Model" (yellow for uncertainty, green for concepts/projects, blue for upscaling/business) to understand where things are and how to work with risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

Over six years, Future by Lund has involved 120 organizations, launching many projects and activities, with sustainability and climate as core drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.

The benefits of their portfolio approach include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>:
*   Establishing a common vocabulary and frame of reference for collective management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   Visualizing strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in activities, especially in exploratory phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.
*   Providing a basis for strategic discussions to align resources towards common directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.
*   Tracking movement across the playing field through snapshots over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.
*   Connecting activities and projects to the assets in the innovation ecosystem to facilitate matching ideas with resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>.

They overlay their "Zone Model" onto the Innovation Facets Model to track how projects move through different phases, enabling handovers between actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. This helps identify who should take over projects for upscaling and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.

For **evidencing impact** and tracing [[system_thinking_and_transformative_change | system-level transformation]], Future by Lund was inspired by Vinnova's "Layer Model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>. This model reports on:
1.  Leverage effects of initial investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.
2.  Initiation of additional projects by partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.
3.  Qualitative storytelling of critical multi-stakeholder events that signify systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.

This approach uses project investments as a proxy for gathering force around themes and tracks qualitative events to visualize the scale-up effect of exploratory activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.

## The Role of Stewards in Ecosystems

In [[managing_innovation_in_complex_environments | multi-stakeholder environments]], the role of those stewarding innovation portfolios is crucial and multi-faceted.

**Viable Cities** views itself as a "mission driver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. This involves connecting governmental agencies, municipalities, and other relevant portfolios, always keeping the cities and citizens at the center, from a need-driven perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. Their role is to coordinate, inspire, create collaboration opportunities, conduct analysis, and push for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>. The Climate City Contract is their core tool, influencing not only what they do in Sweden but also internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. They use open calls, like the Climate Smart Cities Challenge, to find committed partners across countries (e.g., Brazil, Uganda, Colombia, UK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. Grants are used as a lever to trigger innovations in urban governance, and the analysis from dialogues informs future grant calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

**Future by Lund** describes their daily practice as constant engagement, "drinking coffee and having meetings," always asking, "What do you need?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. Their work involves matching needs, initiating pre-studies, and constantly moving between different stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. They act as facilitators, knowing when to push, when to support, and when to step back, as they do not "own" anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>. Their neutrality, as a city-based entity that doesn't earn money, allows them to operate in the gaps between business, city, and university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. They track ideas, capture them, and assess their potential for moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. The team is composed of individuals with diverse, complementary skills, focusing not just on technical aspects but also on building social capital and a shared value system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>. They use the "barbecue model" metaphor, believing that if people who want something can gather in the same place, impact will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:32">[01:21:32]</a>.

## Transitioning the Portfolio and Legitimacy

Both organizations work with a mission-oriented approach, such as "climate neutral cities," which sets the overarching direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:14">[01:24:14]</a>. While the mission is clear, achieving it requires focusing on specific challenge areas, like mobility, which accounts for a significant portion of carbon emissions in cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:08">[01:25:08]</a>.

A key aspect is meeting stakeholders where they are, adapting to diverse contexts, as different cities have different companies, knowledge institutions, civil society organizations, and political frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>.

To maintain **political legitimacy** for long-term goals and exploratory projects, especially when immediate results are not visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:44">[01:48:44]</a>:
*   Higher-level policies (EU, national) provide a stable "flag post" to anchor local efforts against fluctuating city-level political debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:33">[01:49:33]</a>.
*   Emphasizing multiple purposes and outcomes, such as creating better daily lives for citizens, broadens the appeal beyond just climate transition targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>.
*   Connecting global and national mandates to local action helps legitimize processes at the city level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:51">[01:52:51]</a>.
*   Creating a common language through models like the Innovation Facets model helps explain the value of different activities and how they contribute to the overall portfolio, even risky ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:40">[01:53:40]</a>.

## Evaluating Impact in Systemic Change

Evaluating [[system_thinking_and_transformative_change | transformative change]] and [[innovation_portfolios_and_systemic_solutions | mission-oriented approaches]] is complex and difficult using standard models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>. It's not just about cutting CO2 emissions, but also about building the "muscle" for transformative change and enhancing collective learning capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>.

*   **Viable Cities** incorporates a learning strand in their Climate City Contracts, focusing on "how do we learn how to evaluate in a proper way" that is appropriate for a mission-oriented approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:07">[01:44:07]</a>. This involves systematic collaboration, mobilizing actors, and considering policy, behavioral, and normative changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:28">[01:44:28]</a>.
*   **Future by Lund** emphasizes tracking transformative change processes in a structured way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:42">[01:45:42]</a>. This involves agreeing on strategic direction, appropriate indicators of success, and using developmental or formative evaluation to inform continuous strategic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>. The goal is to continuously go back to stakeholders, show progress, and collaboratively decide on necessary adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:08">[01:47:08]</a>. They believe in the value of qualitative tracking and an inclusive agreement on indicators of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:55">[01:46:55]</a>.

A "learning history approach" is being tested by Viable Cities to promote reflexivity sessions, where participants reflect on their practices and accelerate learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>. This aims to institutionalize reflection as a normal part of work within municipalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:41">[01:56:41]</a>.

International collaboration is also vital for learning and adapting best practices, as there is often less competition and more open discussion across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:38">[01:39:38]</a>.

## Next Steps and Resources

The OECD OPSI provides several tools to support [[innovation_portfolios_and_systemic_solutions | portfolio management]]:
*   **Innovation Portfolio Exploration Workshop**: A gamified resource for making sense of a project portfolio, testing transitions, and leveraging assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:45">[01:57:45]</a>.
*   **Self-Service Portfolio Exploration Tool**: For a quick snapshot of how support structures and activities influence portfolio directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:24">[01:58:24]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Exploration Tool Guide**: For running discussions around this topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:43">[01:58:43]</a>.

This is an ongoing area of research for OPSI, with a report including these and other cases to be published later this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:13">[02:00:13]</a>. A community of practice meet-up is planned to further explore unanswered questions and advance this emerging practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>.

The OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation and its accompanying Innovation Playbook serve as crucial tools for developing and enhancing [[future_skills_in_the_public_sector | public service skills]] and capabilities. This framework aims to bridge the gap between good intentions and practical application of innovation within governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Principles of Public Sector Innovation for Skills Development

The Declaration on Public Sector Innovation, to which 43 countries have adhered since its creation over five years ago, outlines five key principles that directly inform [[skills_and_capabilities_development_for_digital_services | skills and capabilities development for digital services]] and broader public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>:

*   **Embrace and Promote Innovation:** Governments should provide high-level sponsorship to encourage and equip all public servants to innovate, ensuring that appropriate skills and incentives are in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Cultivate New Partnerships:** It is essential to involve diverse voices and go beyond government walls, relying on the wisdom and motivation of ecosystem stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This requires inclusive approaches to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Support Exploration, Iteration, and Testing:** Public servants should be encouraged to test ideas before implementing them and to [[learning_by_doing_and_capacity_building_in_public_sector | learn from errors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This means taking controlled risks and using robust methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Diffuse Lessons and Share Practices:** Innovation is inherently shareable and built in partnership, meaning that experiences and lessons should be diffused and shared to foster mutual learning and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## The Innovation Playbook as a Development Tool

The Innovation Playbook translates the Declaration's principles into practical application, providing a simple journey for public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>:

1.  **Frame the Challenge:** Helps users articulate problems as specific innovation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
2.  **Take Stock:** Allows users to assess their current standing, identifying areas for improvement or existing strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
3.  **Apply Collective Intelligence:** Utilizes a repository of use cases, tools, and actions contributed by co-creating countries, which users can adapt to their specific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The Playbook is designed to be accessible, actionable, and user-centric, engaging actual users in its co-creation and co-design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. It aims to build connections and integrate with other resources from the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, such as case study libraries and toolkit navigators, providing a single point of entry for various resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Supporting Materials for Application

To further support its use, the Playbook comes with a "do-it-yourself" package, including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>:
*   **Tutorial Video:** A 90-second introduction on how to use and apply the Playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Interactive Board:** A Mural board for digital team application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **In-person Version:** Materials for running traditional workshops, which can be translated and adapted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Feedback Channel:** A mechanism for users to share experiences, learnings, difficulties, and limitations to inform continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Country Experiences in Skills Development

Several countries have leveraged the Declaration and Playbook to advance [[innovation_skills_for_public_sector | innovation skills for public sector]] and broader public service capabilities:

### Sweden
The Swedish Ministry's adherence to the Declaration provides legitimacy for complex [[innovation_skills_for_public_sector | innovation work in the public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. The Playbook serves as a guide to achieve the government's goal of being innovative and cooperative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Sweden was the first country to translate the Playbook into Swedish and develop in-person workshop materials, adapting it to local needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This local adaptation, including simplification of content, was driven by prototyping with a Swedish target group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. Prototyping is crucial for understanding user needs and driving implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

### Romania
For Romania, joining the Declaration was new and helped introduce the concept of public sector innovation where it was largely unfamiliar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. The Playbook became a critical tool to disseminate and translate the Declaration into concrete words and actions, making it easier for public sector leaders and servants to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. It supports raising awareness and engaging a wider range of colleagues beyond experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. The Innovation Lab in Romania has used the Playbook to build an emerging community of innovators, including a massive virtual session with 800 participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. They plan to integrate the digital Playbook into a new platform dedicated to interactions between public servants on innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

### Chile
Chile views the Declaration as a common understanding of public innovation, signifying its commitment to this agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. The government lab, Laboratorio de Gobierno, aligns its focus with the Declaration's principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. The Declaration provides a clear model of principles, fostering an integrated vision of innovation that goes beyond projects or individual skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

The Laboratorio de Gobierno uses the Declaration as a guideline for its services, including:
*   **Agile Consultancy:** Co-creates solutions with public institutions based on exploration, iteration, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. This service also cultivates new partnerships and involves diverse voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.
*   **Public Innovators Network:** A network of over 28,000 members from various sectors (civil society, academia, private, public) aimed at building capabilities and providing tools to encourage innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Public Innovation School:** A virtual open space launched two weeks prior to this discussion, offering over 50 structured videos on innovation topics, allowing individuals to define their own [[learning_by_doing_and_capacity_building_in_public_sector | learning by doing]] routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Public Innovation Index:** A tool created in 2019 to measure the innovation capabilities of public services, particularly in Chile's central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. It uses a framework of 10 capabilities, including structure, legal framework, skills, digital capabilities, and openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. The index measures maturity levels and offers programs and mentoring to strengthen capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>. Efforts are underway to extend this index to other Latin American countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

## Co-creation and Continuous Improvement
The co-creation process of the Playbook has shown that many countries face similar challenges in public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. This collaborative approach fosters resilience and enables the sharing of best practices and examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. [[Building skills for government collaboration beyond national borders | Cooperation among countries]] on [[developing_leadership_skills_for_public_sector_innovation | capability building]] for innovation is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.

The development of the digital Playbook is a direct result of accumulated experiences and feedback, aiming to create an engaging, playful, interactive, and updatable version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. This ensures it remains a "living creature" rather than a fossilized document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>, with features for automatic report generation and continuous feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>. This iterative approach allows the Playbook to adapt to user needs and improve based on identified "frictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

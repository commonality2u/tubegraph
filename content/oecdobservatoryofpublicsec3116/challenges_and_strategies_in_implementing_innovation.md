The discussion emphasizes how organizations can foster a deliberate and consistent approach to [[implementing_innovative_ideas | implementing innovative ideas]] to be prepared for the unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Background: IP Australia's Innovation Journey

IP Australia is an Australian government agency responsible for issuing intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, designs, and plant breeders' rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The agency also promotes awareness of IP rights and contributes to government advice on the innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. A key aspect of IP Australia's operating model is its status as a cost-recovered agency, which means its operations and investments are funded by fees, granting it significant financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This independence has been a crucial factor in its [[innovation_strategies | innovation journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

The agency's dedicated [[innovation_strategies | innovation journey]] began about eight years prior to 2020, significantly shaped by the leadership of former Director-General Patricia Kelly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This shift was partly triggered by a capability review that suggested an increased cultural embrace of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The executive leadership's commitment and momentum were vital in championing this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. IP Australia sought to "practice what they preached" as an agency playing a significant role in the country's innovation ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

### Key Milestones

*   **Office of the Chief Economist (2012):** Established to build economic expertise, data, and analysis, providing a better structure for decision-making and pushing forward the innovation discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. This fostered confidence in a proactive approach to defining innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Unleashing Staff Potential:** The growing confidence allowed the agency to establish "stop-stop right ears" and encourage ideas from staff, leading to a multi-directional approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This empowered highly skilled staff, particularly in STEM fields, to take risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Budget for Experimentation:** A crucial commitment from the executive was to dedicate a small percentage (less than 1%) of the annual budget explicitly to innovation, experimentation, technology, and ideas, accepting that this investment was necessary for their aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:17:23]</a>.

## [[Innovation strategies | Strategies for Implementing Innovation]]

### 1. Strategic Planning and Vision

*   **Clear Strategic Direction:** The capability review led to the establishment of a very clear strategic direction, outlined in a "Roadmap to 2030" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. This roadmap, incorporated annually into the corporate plan, sets high-level ambitions and guardrails for future initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   **Three Horizons Approach:** The roadmap adopted a three horizons approach, setting long-term goals (e.g., towards 2028-2030) that necessitate taking risks and "leaps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This constantly prompts questions about how to achieve long-term aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Vision Building:** The strategic roadmap was a deeply collaborative effort, breaking down the vision into operational excellence, service excellence, and value-added objectives across different parts of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This broad engagement ensured all parts of the agency understood the long-term ambition and the necessity of risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

### 2. Risk Management and Experimentation

*   **Explicit Acceptance of Risk:** An explicit acceptance of dedicating a small budget (1%) to experimentation, particularly around early prototyping and agile methodologies, has been key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. This approach helps identify issues quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.
*   **Agile Methodology:** Using agile methodologies to develop prototypes in collaboration with business areas, IT, customers, and third-party experts, and iterating on ideas, helps in rapid testing and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.
*   **Leadership Appetite for Risk:** Leadership's willingness to accept risk and back experts is vital for navigating risky initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.
*   **Scenario Planning:** Regular scenario planning and strategic risk management, including exercises like pandemic drills, help agencies prepare for unpredictable events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. This makes organizations less dismissive of future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.

### 3. Collaboration and Partnerships

*   **Private Sector Engagement:** IP Australia actively collaborates with private sector companies, leveraging their expertise to build innovative solutions like trademark search tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.
*   **Outcome-Oriented Procurement:** Rather than rigid, defined outputs, procurement focuses on outcomes and customer experience, allowing for a more flexible and mutual learning journey with partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.
*   **Building Trust:** Long-term trust and strong working relationships, particularly at the personal level between staff and private sector partners, are crucial for successful collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

### 4. Cultural Change and Communication

*   **Internal Communication:** Clear internal communication from leadership is essential to ensure staff understand the strategic direction, mission, and appetite for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. This educational challenge helps calibrate risk understanding across the agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
*   **Layered Communication:** For complex ideas, especially from technical staff to non-technical staff, it's effective to communicate in layers, starting from a high-level vision and providing concrete examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.
*   **Encouraging Adaptability:** Managers must encourage staff to embrace opportunities provided by new infrastructure and policies, fostering a culture where working differently is supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
*   **Understanding Different Innovation Types:** Recognizing the distinction between sustaining change, transformational change, mission-oriented innovation, and enhancement-oriented innovation (e.g., using models like the "innovation passage model") helps manage the pace and types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>. This allows leadership to calibrate pressure and avoid change exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>.

### 5. Staff Empowerment and Development

*   **Trust in Staff:** A strong trust relationship with staff enables rapid shifts in working arrangements, as seen during the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.
*   **Bottom-Up Innovation:** Technical staff can drive bottom-up innovation by understanding leadership's strategic objectives and risks, framing their ideas in that context, and being prepared to fail fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. They should also be open to evaluation and provide evidence-based proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.
*   **Investing in Skills:** While recruitment may not explicitly change, investing in staff to provide them with the necessary extra skills for an innovative environment is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>.

## Examples of Successful Innovations at IP Australia

*   **Trademark Search (2017):** A revolutionary tool developed in collaboration with a private sector company that combined image searching and machine learning to drastically simplify trademark searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Users could upload logos for instantaneous searches across 400,000 images, reducing rejections and saving time for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. It led to a 54% reduction in call center inquiries related to trademark searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   **Trademark Assist (2018):** An interactive tool using machine learning to educate and assist trademark applicants through the initial application stages, helping them submit high-quality applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. It has been used by over 41,000 users since its launch and has increased successful applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Futures Program:** An internal program with allocated "risky" funds for experimentation, particularly in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Internal Quality Assurance System:** A "hard yards" innovation involving complex changes to internal quality management, compliance, and examination report production. This involved significant organizational change and cultural shifts around collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation (Rides in One Rio Program):** A large, high-risk IT build completed in late 2019 with a partner, transforming trademark systems and physically changing how staff worked in the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. This involved migrating 500 million records seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.
*   **Activity-Based Working:** Implementation of flexible physical workplaces to suit different work types, supported by universal laptops, good Wi-Fi, and audio-visual equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>. This, combined with flexible workplace arrangements and a strong trust relationship with staff, enabled a rapid shift from 100 to 1,000 remote workers in one week during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

## [[Definition and challenges of innovation | Challenges in Implementing Innovation]]

*   **Mixed History of IT Projects:** Public sector IT projects often face challenges and do not always go smoothly, requiring significant learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.
*   **Selling Abstract Ideas:** One fundamental [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | challenge of innovation]] is trying to sell an idea that cannot be fully spelled out due to a lack of comparative references or examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion:** Bureaucratic and hierarchical settings can be risk-averse, making it difficult to push through innovative approaches without strong leadership commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.
*   **Limited Precedent:** For unique organizations like IP offices, there are limited examples of successful innovations to copy, requiring leaps of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.
*   **Change Exhaustion:** A continuous push for radical "transformational change" can lead to stress and "change exhaustion" within the organization if not calibrated appropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>.
*   **Understanding Risk:** Staff at all levels may struggle to consciously frame and talk about risk within established frameworks, which can hinder decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
*   **Systematic Failure Reporting:** Lack of systematic failure reports and formal evaluation processes can make it difficult to learn from projects that don't achieve their intended outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>.
*   **Killing Projects:** It can be very difficult to stop a project, even when it should be terminated, leading to continued investment in failing initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:33">[01:14:33]</a>.
*   **Organizational Pace:** Different people and parts of the organization move at different paces on the innovation journey, making it complex to synchronize efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Clarity of Purpose:** Innovation can be sidelined if the purpose and importance are not clearly understood and prioritized, especially against other measured objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Continuous Improvement

*   **Confidence in Capability:** The experience of successfully adapting to crises, like COVID-19, builds confidence in the organization's ability to innovate and respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.
*   **Consistent Strategic Refresh:** Regularly refreshing the strategic roadmap (e.g., every three horizons) helps ensure the organization remains vigilant, prepared for future scenarios, and engaged in continuous evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.
*   **Building Risk Management Maturity:** Continuously building people's confidence in understanding and dealing with risk across the organization is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>.
*   **Starting with Adaptive Innovation:** If an organization is just starting its innovation journey, beginning with "adaptive information" (enhancements/adaptations) can build comfort and confidence before tackling more "transformative" initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.
*   **Time and Patience:** Implementing whole-agency change and innovation takes time to understand where the agency has come from and for individuals to adjust to new paces and complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>.
*   **Common Touchstone:** A well-developed strategic roadmap, widely adopted and serving as a common touchstone, helps steer the organization's direction even amidst varying opinions on pace or risk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.

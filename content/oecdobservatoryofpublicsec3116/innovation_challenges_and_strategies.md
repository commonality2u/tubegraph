The OECD's Innovation Playbook is a tool developed to translate the OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation into practical application, aiming to bridge the gap between good intentions and actual practices in government innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This solution was co-created by diverse countries to facilitate the application of the Declaration in distinct contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation: Guiding Principles for [[innovation_strategies|Innovation Strategies]]

The Declaration on Public Sector Innovation provides high-level guidance for governments to steer and promote [[innovation_strategies|innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Created over five years ago, 43 countries have already adhered to it, underscoring its significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Its five core principles are:

*   **Embracing and Denormalizing Innovation**: Providing high-level sponsorship within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Encouraging and Equipping Public Servants**: Ensuring skills and incentives are in place for all public servants to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Cultivating New Partnerships and Involving Diverse Voices**: Going beyond government walls to rely on the wisdom and motivation of ecosystem stakeholders, ensuring inclusivity in [[innovation_as_a_response_to_societal_challenges|innovation]] creation, implementation, and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Supporting Exploration, Iteration, and Testing**: Testing before implementing, learning from errors, and managing risks in controlled environments using robust methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Diffusing Lessons and Sharing Practices**: Building no monopolies of [[innovation_strategies|innovation]], as it is inherently shareable and built in partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This principle drives the sharing of experiences to learn from others and improve activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## The Innovation Playbook: A Journey to [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_innovation|Implement Innovation]]

The Playbook provides a simple journey to apply these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>:

1.  **Frame the Challenge**: Translate problems into defined challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
2.  **Take Stock of Current Standing**: Assess areas of strength and weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
3.  **Apply and Adapt Solutions**: Utilize the collective intelligence of use cases, tools, and actions contributed by co-creators, adapting them to specific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Key Characteristics and Strategic Value

The Playbook aims to be:
*   **Accessible**: Users can jump directly into applying it without instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Actionable**: It's designed to facilitate concrete interventions rather than just being an archival resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **User-Centric**: Actual users were engaged in its co-creation and co-design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Adaptable**: It can be adapted to different contexts, with learnings from experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Connection-Building**: It fosters connections among innovators and integrates with other resources like the case study library and toolkit navigator, offering a single point of entry to a galaxy of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Overcoming [[overcoming_challenges_in_innovation_proposals|Challenges in Innovation Proposals]]

One of the main [[Definition and challenges of innovation|challenges of innovation]] in the public sector is gaining legitimacy and mandate from political leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, as well as raising awareness and demonstrating value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. The Playbook serves as a concrete support tool to communicate the Declaration's messages and provide practical advice on applying its principles, helping to "remarket" the importance of [[innovation_strategies_in_government|innovation in public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

### DIY Package and User Feedback

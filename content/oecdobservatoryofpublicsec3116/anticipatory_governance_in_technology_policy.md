Anticipatory governance in technology policy addresses the challenge of navigating an increasingly complex world where problems transcend traditional governmental silos [00:00:20]. The aim is to create a more integrated anticipatory process throughout government, especially concerning technology policy and its interaction with other governance institutions and policy areas [00:01:09].

## Key Challenges in Governing Technology
The rapid evolution and unclear impacts of emerging technologies present several challenges for governance [01:08:31]:
*   **Uncertainty** Technologies are rapidly evolving, with impacts that are often unclear [01:08:34].
*   **Misfits** There are frequent misfits between emerging technologies and existing legal and regulatory categories [01:08:41].
*   **Disruption** Many technologies have uniquely disruptive aspects, leading to deep social disruption, such as seen with Uber [01:08:49].
*   **Enabling Large Work Areas** Platform technologies can enable vast areas of work, each with potential consequences, as exemplified by Industry 4.0 or the OECD's "next production revolution" [01:09:00].
*   **Coleridge Dilemma** This dilemma highlights the challenge of regulating emerging technologies:
    *   **Regulating Early** If regulation occurs too early, the full consequences might not be apparent, risking misguided, inadequate, or unnecessary constraints on innovation [01:09:35].
    *   **Regulating Later** Changing course later becomes expensive and difficult because technology is often built into infrastructure, making "end-of-pipe" solutions potentially too late [01:09:53]. As Lawrence Lessig famously stated, "code is law," emphasizing how digital technology itself can act in a governing fashion [01:10:14].

## Core Concepts and Approaches

### [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance]]
The concept of [[anticipatory_innovation_governance]] is central to addressing these challenges, focusing on using the future in the present to foster innovative ways of working within government [00:01:35].

### Technology Assessment
A key aspect of [[anticipatory_innovation_governance]] is the presence of strategic intelligence functions and technology foresight [00:24:23]. While some governments might not have formal technology assessment processes [00:42:54], others, like the Netherlands, have institutes dedicated to providing long-term views on the impact of science, technology, and innovation on society [00:27:17].

### Co-creation and Citizen Engagement
Involving citizens in the process of both foresight and science, technology, and innovation (STI) is crucial [02:09:54]. This includes "citizen science" and "citizen futures" to help people shape and understand trends and articulate the futures they desire [02:10:00].
*   **Equipping Citizens** It is important to equip citizens with data and information they might not otherwise access, often through dedicated learning sessions during deliberative processes like citizen juries [01:20:27].
*   **Facilitation** Facilitators must structure citizen processes clearly, sometimes using oblique, non-technical questions to elicit implicit qualitative data about fears, hopes, and emerging trends [01:21:29].
*   **Diverse Perspectives** Rather than averaging out opinions, it's vital to record the broadness of opinions, as minority stances can often point to future developments or underlying fears/hopes [01:23:48]. Creating spaces for diverse groups, including those with less formal education, to discuss and find common ground on values is also crucial [01:24:37].
*   **Limitations** While valuable, co-creation is not a panacea [01:26:51]. It can reconfigure power dynamics, and its effectiveness depends on who is included and for what reasons [01:53:27]. Sustaining co-creation communities is challenging due to factors like project-based funding, which can hinder continuous engagement over time [01:29:34].

### Living Labs and Experimentation
Living labs, testbeds, real-world laboratories, and sandboxes are experimental spaces designed to test and advance transformative technologies under real-world conditions, ideally with public participation [00:46:23].
*   **Beyond Technology Testing** The focus has shifted from merely testing technologies in societies to "testing societies" around new technologies, prompting questions about the kind of society desired and the implications of regulatory loopholes [00:48:25].
*   **Co-development** There is a need to co-develop technology and regulation in tandem, aiming for "better regulation" rather than just "lower regulation" [00:49:46].
*   **Tentative Governance** This approach acknowledges that while a path can be drawn for transformations, new political, societal, or technical questions may arise at any time, requiring flexibility [00:34:26].

### Scalability and its Governance Implications
The concept of scale and scalability has become central to innovation discourses, particularly with "big tech" platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Uber, and Airbnb, which have amassed hundreds of millions of users rapidly [00:56:16].
*   **Runaway Consequences** From a governance perspective, the runaway consequences of rapid scaling are problematic [00:56:52].
*   **Public Sector Analogies** The public sector also seeks scaled, transformative solutions for grand societal challenges and missions, reflecting a similar concern with scale [00:57:03].
*   **Critical Thinking about Scale** It is crucial to critically examine what it means to frame societal problems as issues of scale, and how power is reconfigured when prioritizing scalability [00:57:28].

### The Role of Private Sector in [[Anticipatory Governance]]
While the public sector often leads in basic research [01:31:46], the private sector drives the implementation and scaling of technologies [01:31:56].
*   **Engaging the Private Sector** A key challenge is to involve the private sector in anticipatory discussions about desired futures alongside government officials and citizens [01:34:08].
*   **Mechanisms for Influence**
    *   **Defining Challenges** Government can define clear public policy challenges, inviting creative solutions from the private sector, similar to hackathons but for public purposes [01:37:10].
    *   **Value-Driven Corporations** The rise of "b corporations" and value-driven corporations that embed public values into their corporate structure offers a path for technology in the public interest [01:35:28].
    *   **Radical Transdisciplinarity** Integrating humanities and social sciences perspectives can help articulate societal values that engineers can then optimize for in technology design [01:36:12].
    *   **Focus on Startups** A significant target for [[anticipatory_governance]] is to instill a mindset in startups to consider the social dimensions of scalability from the outset, as part of their business model and technology design [01:38:41].
    *   **Common Language** Developing a common language around "public value" can engage startups and other private sector entities who are interested in demonstrating their contribution to public good [01:40:42].

## International Perspectives

### Singapore's Approach
Singapore has a fairly well-established foresight system, conducting scenario planning since the late 1980s and diversifying its toolkit in the late 2000s (e.g., setting up the Center for Strategic Futures around 2008-2010) [01:43:30].
*   **Integrated Foresight** Technology, science, and innovation elements are strongly integrated into Singapore's foresight system, as good foresight requires analyzing technology as a source of critical uncertainties [01:15:16]. Foresight is inherently systemic, examining how STI interacts with politics, society, and the economy [01:54:50].
*   **Decentralized Foresight** Foresight happens across the entire government: at the center, in individual ministries, in think tanks, and within institutes of higher learning, indicating a maturing ecosystem [01:02:40].
*   **STI Ecosystem** While formal foresight methodologies are less prevalent within the general STI ecosystem (e.g., research, commercialization, policy promotion), they are emerging, particularly within the National Research Foundation (NRF) [01:17:11]. The NRF works to integrate research, commercialization, and policy, actively scanning and sense-making global trends [01:19:40].
*   **Citizen Involvement** There is a growing emphasis on involving citizens in both foresight and STI processes (e.g., citizen science, citizen futures) [01:20:48]. Initiatives like the "Emerging Stronger" citizen engagement process in response to COVID-19 exemplify bringing diverse perspectives to shape societal transformation [01:21:44].

### [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance in Finland]]
Finland's broader public sector has over 20 years of experience with future committees in parliament working on technology assessment issues [00:43:56]. However, these remain unique and somewhat separate from the rest of the government's work [00:44:05].

### The Netherlands' Rathenau Institute
The Rathenau Institute, founded 35 years ago based on the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment, supports a long-term view on the impact of science, technology, and innovation on society [00:26:36].
*   **Mandate** Its task is to identify political questions arising from new developments, anticipate societal disruptions (e.g., mass unemployment), and determine where societal deliberation is needed [00:27:35].
*   **Independence** The institute operates independently, allowing it to provide objective analysis [00:27:10].
*   **Parliamentary Work** It works for parliament, providing options rather than political directives, highlighting values at stake for new developments and their implications for existing societal agreements (e.g., digital tools at work) [00:29:07].
*   **Future of Digital Society** A breakthrough initiative is a standing parliamentary committee dedicated to the future of digital society, allowing for foresight beyond immediate concerns (e.g., looking at 6G instead of just 5G, or virtual/augmented reality instead of just WhatsApp for government contact) [00:30:52].
*   **Societal Transformations** The institute also addresses "wicked problems" like energy transitions, which are technical yet highly political [00:32:00]. These require multi-stakeholder initiatives and a "tentative governance" approach, anticipating new technical or political questions [00:33:39].
*   **Bioethical Issues** The institute facilitates public dialogues on sensitive topics like human DNA modification, shifting the discussion from technical details to broader societal values and justice, involving citizens to uncover critical questions for policymakers [00:36:10].

## OECD's Perspective
The OECD is actively working on connecting the foresight and anticipation communities with the technology assessment and STI communities, recognizing the co-evolution of technology and governance [01:06:06].
*   **Upstream Governance Principles** The OECD, in collaboration with Sebastian, has articulated design principles for "upstream governance" – engaging in the innovation process itself through different policy levers [01:10:47]:
    *   **Anticipation:** To address deep uncertainties from emerging technologies [01:11:12].
    *   **Inclusion:** Ensuring involvement of diverse actors in technology production and deliberation [01:11:28].
    *   **Directionality:** Guiding innovation towards desired goals and societal missions [01:11:47].
*   **Intervention Mechanisms** These principles can inform interventions at various stages of technological development (basic research, applied, midstream, downstream) [01:13:01].
*   **Standards** Voluntary design standards are recognized as a powerful mechanism for upstream and [[anticipatory_governance]] [01:14:21]. They embed values and are instruments of "moral economy," suggesting they should be subject to democratic inclusion [01:14:42]. Concepts like "safe by design" and "ethics by design" (e.g., for AI) are examples of building values into technology development [01:15:08].
*   **"Technology In and For Society" Meeting** The OECD is sponsoring a meeting in December titled "Technology in and for Society: Innovating Well for Inclusive Transitions" [01:15:40]. This event aims to combine the need for socio-technical transitions (e.g., in energy, agri-food) with acknowledging the disruptive potential of emerging technologies [01:16:00]. It will cover topics like people-centered technology, foresight for STI agenda setting, inclusive technology development, global cooperation, responsible innovation in the private sector, and experiments in [[anticipatory_governance]] [01:16:55].

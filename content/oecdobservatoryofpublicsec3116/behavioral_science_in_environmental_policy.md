The OECD has launched its report "Mind Shift Green: Lift Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy," reflecting the organization's commitment to supporting governments in tackling climate challenges more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18"> [00:00:18]</a>. The report emphasizes that the green transition, one of the biggest challenges of our time, is not solely about technology or policies but also fundamentally about human behaviorâ€”how people live, work, and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30"> [00:00:30]</a>. Progress requires a deep understanding of human behavior, as technical solutions alone are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48"> [00:00:48]</a>. By focusing on human behavior, the report aims to help governments bridge the gap between bold ambitions and real-world impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01"> [00:01:01]</a>.

## The Role of Behavioral Science in the Green Transition
Human behavior is central to achieving a green, low-carbon future, necessitating changes in the behaviors of individuals, businesses, and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42"> [00:02:42]</a>. [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] offers valuable insights into encouraging these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55"> [00:02:55]</a>. Shifting behaviors in key areas like transport, food consumption, and energy use could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70% by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00"> [00:03:00]</a>. [[Role of behavioral science in government | Behavioral science]] supports governments in shaping better policies by understanding how people make decisions, particularly relevant for demand-side strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13"> [00:03:13]</a>.

The OECD's survey on environmental policy and individual behavior (EPIC) indicates that the availability, affordability, and convenience of sustainable options are key drivers of sustainable behaviors at the household level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30"> [00:03:30]</a>. For instance, policies reducing transport emissions (e.g., taxes on high-emission vehicles, subsidies for EVs) need to be accompanied by infrastructure investments like affordable public transport or accessible EV charging stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47"> [00:03:47]</a>. Integrating [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] into policymaking is essential for governments to design effective strategies that drive lasting change by understanding and addressing factors shaping people's decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11"> [00:04:11]</a>.

The OECD's multi-disciplinary Net Zero Plus project aims to achieve Net Zero by mid-century, focusing on a rapid, just, and resilient transition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing resilience to climate impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29"> [00:05:29]</a>. Key policy papers within this project include:
*   **Demand-side policies for climate change mitigation:** Drawing on work from the IEA and OECD, this paper offers guidance on using [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to design effective interventions in energy use in buildings, transport, waste, and diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01"> [00:06:01]</a>. Tools like green defaults, social influences, and choice architecture have proven effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31"> [00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Role of the government-citizen interface in driving climate action:** This explores how governments can engage citizens more effectively, leveraging OECD's work on trusting government, citizen participation, public communication, and [[Behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45"> [00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Exploring positive tipping points:** This work stream investigates how social, economic, and political tipping points can lead to systemic shifts and accelerate emission reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17"> [00:07:17]</a>. Behavioral mechanisms like choice architecture, social norms, and peer effects can play a pivotal role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40"> [00:07:40]</a>.

### Trust in Government
Governments are at the heart of the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20"> [00:09:20]</a>. The OECD has been working with various governance communities to mainstream "greening government" by transforming government operations and increasing their role in the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26"> [00:09:26]</a>, including green budgeting and regulating for the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50"> [00:09:50]</a>.

OECD surveys indicate a low level of trust in government and public institutions, with less than four out of ten citizens in 30 surveyed OECD member countries expressing trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41"> [00:10:41]</a>. Despite high expectations for governments to prioritize reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting climate transition, only 42% of surveyed citizens are confident their country will achieve this goal within the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04"> [00:11:04]</a>. This highlights a significant "trust gap" between expectations and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37"> [00:11:37]</a>. [[Behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral science]] helps bridge this gap by aligning policies with public expectations, fostering trust, and making engagement easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00"> [00:28:00]</a>.

## Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy
The policy paper identifies six trends illustrating how governments are harnessing [[Behavioral science and climate change | behavioral science]] to accelerate the green transition, based on an analysis of over 100 case studies from more than 30 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12"> [00:15:12]</a>.

### Trend 1: Informing Policies at Every Stage of the Policy Cycle
Traditionally, [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] was often used late in the policy process to fine-tune existing policies or improve communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10"> [00:18:10]</a>. Analysis shows a rapid shift, with policymakers now using [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral science]] at every stage, including the very start, to better understand behavioral challenges and design smarter, more effective policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31"> [00:18:31]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] Repairability Index in France
>The French interministerial directorate for public transformation developed a repairability index for electronic products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02"> [00:19:02]</a>. They applied [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] at every policy cycle stage:
>1.  **Problem Analysis:** Identified that 62% of consumers discard broken electronic devices without considering repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24"> [00:19:24]</a>.
>2.  **Design & Test:** Used [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to design and test labels empowering consumers to make informed choices about laptop repairability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39"> [00:19:39]</a>.
>3.  **Implementation & Assessment:** The most successful label was implemented, leading to consumers opting for laptops with higher repairability scores and manufacturers introducing more repairable models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52"> [00:19:52]</a>.
>This intervention was effective on both consumer demand and product supply sides, highlighting the effectiveness of applying [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] comprehensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18"> [00:20:18]</a>.

### Trend 2: Driving Climate Adaptation Efforts
While [[Behavioral science and climate change | behavioral science]] traditionally focused on climate mitigation (reducing emissions), it now plays a larger role in climate adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42"> [00:20:42]</a>. Adaptation involves adjusting behaviors to deal with immediate and long-term climate change effects, such as preventing wildfires or guiding actions during floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56"> [00:20:56]</a>. Effective adaptation policies must be grounded in how people actually behave, leading policymakers to increasingly turn to [[Behavioral science and climate change | behavioral science]] for smarter, more responsive strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14"> [00:21:14]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] Farmer Drought Assistance in Australia
>During a severe drought in Eastern Australia (2017-2019), uptake of available farmer support was low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42"> [00:21:42]</a>. The Australian government's Behavioral Economics Team (BETA) identified barriers and motivators influencing farmers' willingness to seek help:
>*   **Awareness vs. Action:** Farmers knew about government assistance but didn't know how to concretely ask for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38"> [00:22:38]</a>.
>*   **Complexity & Delay:** The application process was overly complicated and lengthy, causing farmers to wait until their situation became critical before seeking help, partly due to stigma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47"> [00:22:47]</a>.
>*   **Lack of Personalization:** Information often lacked personal relevance to specific farmer situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13"> [00:23:13]</a>.
>BETA recommended reframing support with [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to encourage earlier assistance-seeking and establishing trusted local points for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26"> [00:23:26]</a>.

### Trend 3: Predicting and Accounting for Public Acceptability of Green Reforms
Governments are increasingly using [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to predict and account for public acceptability of green reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56"> [00:23:56]</a>. Understanding public perception and response is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07"> [00:24:07]</a>. Leveraging data, especially longitudinal data, helps governments gauge citizens' climate awareness, support for reforms, preferences, and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12"> [00:24:12]</a>. This allows for clearer, more accessible policies aligned with public values, ultimately building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25"> [00:24:25]</a>. Transparently refined policies based on such insights can boost public engagement, encourage sustainable behaviors, and strengthen green reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34"> [00:24:34]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] SME Sustainability Investments in the Netherlands
>The [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] team at the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy researched behavioral drivers and barriers affecting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their sustainability investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01"> [00:25:01]</a>.
>*   **Findings:** While 64% of SMEs were inclined to make their businesses more sustainable while maintaining profitability, only 5-18% had taken feasible steps, and only 17% had concrete plans within five months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40"> [00:25:40]</a>.
>*   **Motivators:** High energy prices, cost savings, and compliance with legal obligations were key motivators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13"> [00:26:13]</a>.
>*   **Barriers:** High perceived costs (time and money) and preference to allocate resources to other priorities were significant barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30"> [00:26:30]</a>.
>These results were instrumental in shaping concrete policy approaches tailored to the behavioral realities of SMEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48"> [00:26:48]</a>.

### Trend 4: Boosting Citizen Participation in Environmental Policies
Governments and civic society actors are finding proactive and inclusive ways to engage citizens in shaping and [[implementing_behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | implementing behavioral insights in public policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20"> [00:27:20]</a>. By applying [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]], they mobilize diverse groups and create more opportunities for public involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29"> [00:27:29]</a>. This is crucial given that many citizens feel they lack meaningful chances to participate in policymaking, as shown by the OECD trust survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43"> [00:27:43]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] National Dialogue on Climate Action in Ireland
>This initiative engages citizens directly in climate action through three main actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26"> [00:28:26]</a>:
>1.  Raise awareness, understanding, and engagement of climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45"> [00:28:45]</a>.
>2.  Motivate, enable, and empower citizens to adopt sustainable behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51"> [00:28:51]</a>.
>3.  Use findings to inform policy responses and [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59"> [00:28:59]</a>.
>Since 2021, over 12,000 citizens have participated in annual climate conversations, and more than 1,000 stakeholders engaged in forums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06"> [00:29:06]</a>. A key outcome is a behavioral insights dashboard that allows policymakers to integrate evidence from social and behavioral studies into policy design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36"> [00:29:36]</a>. This program provides valuable insights into public motivations, barriers, and abilities regarding climate action, enabling the development of targeted solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00"> [00:30:00]</a>.

### Trend 5: Increasing Demand for Sustainable Goods, Services, and Technologies
Governments are increasingly using [[Behavioral public policy | behavioral science]] to drive demand for sustainable goods, services, and technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29"> [00:30:29]</a>. Demand-side policies are essential, with the potential to reduce emissions by as much as 70% by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41"> [00:30:41]</a>. This includes:
*   Designing and testing labels to encourage sustainable consumer choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58"> [00:30:58]</a>.
*   Removing barriers to increase the use of green services like public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07"> [00:31:07]</a>.
*   Encouraging the adoption of green technologies (e.g., heat pumps) by making them financially appealing and adoption easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14"> [00:31:14]</a>.
These efforts demonstrate how demand-side policies can unlock significant progress in the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28"> [00:31:28]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] Climate Labels for Food in Denmark
>The Danish Competition and Consumer Authority tested two types of climate labels to guide consumers toward sustainable food choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44"> [00:31:44]</a>:
>*   **Best-in-class label:** Highlighted the top-performing product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00"> [00:32:00]</a>.
>*   **Scale label:** Ranked products based on climate impact from low to high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05"> [00:32:05]</a>.
>Consumers preferred the scale label, but it did not lead to a significant change in overall purchasing behavior in the experiment, with the aggregate effect on CO2 emissions being neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15"> [00:32:15]</a>. While some consumers changed purchases to reduce emissions, others with little interest in climate labels increased theirs, balancing the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41"> [00:32:41]</a>. The team suggested that labels need to provide clearer, more specific information that resonates stronger with consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16"> [00:33:16]</a>. This highlights that widespread behavior change requires not only better labeling but also consumer engagement and education on environmental impacts of food choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33"> [00:33:33]</a>.

### Trend 6: Building Resilience to Climate Misinformation
Governments are leveraging [[Behavioral science and climate change | behavioral science]] to build resilience against and tackle the spread of climate misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49"> [00:33:49]</a>. Many are turning to [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to understand susceptibility to misinformation, factors driving its spread, and to develop strategies to counter its impact and strengthen democratic resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03"> [00:34:03]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] Canada's PARCA Initiative
>The Program of Applied Research on Climate Action (PARCA) in Canada uses [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to counter climate misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31"> [00:34:31]</a>. The team conducts national surveys and in-depth studies to assess the Canadian public's susceptibility to climate-related misinformation, aiming to understand how people think, feel, and act when confronted with it, and to identify the most harmful types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44"> [00:34:44]</a>.
>In 2024, a randomized control trial tested behavioral interventions to boost resilience to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26"> [00:35:26]</a>. These focused on:
>*   Encouraging individuals to assess information accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41"> [00:35:41]</a>.
>*   Strengthening digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50"> [00:35:50]</a>.
>*   Preemptive refutation (actively correcting common false claims) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52"> [00:35:52]</a>.
>Interventions enhancing digital media literacy and providing active preemptive refutations were most effective in reducing susceptibility and decreasing false news spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02"> [00:36:02]</a>. However, passive information about finding misinformation made people more skeptical and less accurate in identifying true headlines, suggesting unintended consequences if critical thinking tools aren't provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21"> [00:36:21]</a>.

## Moving from Insights to Action
The report encourages governments to [[implementing_behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | implement behavioral insights in public policy]] to trigger positive social tipping pointsâ€”key moments where small behavioral shifts lead to large-scale, lasting change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30"> [00:37:30]</a>. To move forward, governments should:

1.  **Create conditions for positive tipping points:** Identify critical moments and behaviors with potential to spark systemic change, amplifying traditional policies and ensuring enduring behavioral shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53"> [00:37:53]</a>.
2.  **Drive demand for sustainable choices:** When more people adopt sustainable behaviors (e.g., energy-efficient products, public transport), it creates a ripple effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21"> [00:38:21]</a>. [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] tools like default options and dynamic social norms can drive widespread adoption and habit changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40"> [00:38:40]</a>.
3.  **Engage citizens as active participants:** Use [[Behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] to empower people as agents of change, reducing participation barriers, building trust, and aligning policies with public expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55"> [00:38:55]</a>.
4.  **Strengthen decision-making within governments:** Integrate [[Behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] into government decision-making processes regarding environmental policies to reduce biases and improve effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19"> [00:39:19]</a>.

### Caveats
*   **Individual responsibility:** The burden of responsibility should not solely rest on individuals; the goal is to empower consumers, users, and citizens as active participants in the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55"> [00:39:55]</a>.
*   **Not a silver bullet:** [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] is an important piece of a broader strategy, not a "silver bullet." A holistic approach including technology and systemic changes is necessary for meaningful progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15"> [00:40:15]</a>.
*   **Demand-side policies:** The term "demand-side policies" in this report extends beyond individual choices to include governments and industries, recognizing their power in driving procurement efforts and systematic demand shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42"> [00:40:42]</a>. Real impact demands collaboration across all sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10"> [00:41:10]</a>.

## Academic Reflections

### Professor Lucia Arian, Cambridge University
Professor Lucia Arian highlighted that the OECD has been a pioneer in using [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral economics]] and [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] globally since at least 2007-2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55"> [00:42:55]</a>. The OECD's work has built an impressive network of specialists interested in using [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] in national governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35"> [00:43:35]</a>.

Lucia Arian's reflections on the trends:
*   **Integration across the policy cycle:** This trend is a "hopeful" development, allowing for bottom-up input where people in direct situations best understand the real problems and barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08"> [00:44:08]</a>. This complements top-down mandates, making policies more practical, widely accepted, and capable of fostering systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00"> [00:45:00]</a>. It has become part of good governance, aligning with approaches from organizations like the World Bank and UN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38"> [00:45:38]</a>.
*   **Localized and adaptive climate solutions:** The increasing relevance of adaptation, unfortunately due to slow mitigation progress, makes [[Behavioral science and climate change | behavioral approaches]] crucial for tailored, community-specific strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12"> [00:46:12]</a>. Micro-interventions have significant potential for problems like wildfires, which are often behavioral in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58"> [00:46:58]</a>.
*   **Demand-side policy:** It took a long time for demand-side policy to be acknowledged in mitigation efforts, with the IPCC report finally including a dedicated chapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23"> [00:47:23]</a>. Encouraging sustainable consumption through choice architecture and social norms is highly relevant, as 30-40% of potential impact lies in demand-side policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46"> [00:47:46]</a>. It's important to differentiate between "doing sustainability" and "buying sustainability," emphasizing that habits and actual use are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10"> [00:48:10]</a>.

Concerns raised by Lucia Arian:
*   **Public engagement, acceptability, misinformation:** There's a "huge epistemological crisis" where social tribes interpret facts differently, making true deliberative processes difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58"> [00:48:58]</a>. [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral approaches]], participation, and deliberation can provide platforms for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21"> [00:49:21]</a>.
*   **Disinformation:** Misinformation was a top worry at Davos, recognizing its huge implications for democracy and peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51"> [00:49:51]</a>. [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral approaches]] like inoculation strategies are important in this fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16"> [00:50:16]</a>.
*   **Trust in government crisis:** World leaders deliberately interweave fact, fiction, and fantasy, leading to low public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27"> [00:50:27]</a>. Surveys show significant public grievance and support for hostile action to force change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42"> [00:50:42]</a>. There's a need to reinstall trust in experts and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17"> [00:51:17]</a>.
*   **Backlash against everything green:** There's a significant "greenlash," particularly from the US, with some leaders dismantling decades of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30"> [00:51:30]</a>.
>[!INFO] Solution
>[[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral approaches]] are valuable tools, especially as big systemic changes become more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02"> [00:52:02]</a>. Smaller, adaptable, local, and participative interventions (like "speedboats" rather than "tankers") can be helpful for horizontal trust-building, motivating local sustainability, and building acceptability through participation and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18"> [00:52:18]</a>. "Deep listening" (empathy and understanding other opinions) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51"> [00:52:51]</a>. Academia must be honest about confidence levels in research and actively detect "dark nudges" or "dark patterns" to counter manipulative forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26"> [00:53:26]</a>.

### Professor Sanchayan Banerji, Kings College London
Professor Sanchayan Banerji praised the report as timely, novel, and comprehensive, noting OECD's long-standing leadership in [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] and environmental policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00"> [00:55:00]</a>.

Key themes from the report:
*   **Backed by climate science:** The report rigorously demonstrates that behavior is a key driver for climate action, supported by extensive case studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35"> [00:57:35]</a>. Humans care about services, and the goal is to shift from fossil-based sources to greener ones by changing behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25"> [00:59:25]</a>. Smaller daily actions like changing diets or transport can contribute significantly to mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:45"> [00:59:45]</a>.
*   **Citizen-led, participatory, people-centered approach:** This reinforces previous OECD work, addressing trust in institutions, acceptability, and public support for policies like carbon pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14"> [01:00:14]</a>. [[Behavioral public policy | Behavioral science]] can help overcome barriers to harder measures, with softer policies phased in first to build understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24"> [01:01:24]</a>. Building agency and autonomy in decision-making emphasizes the need for bottom-up tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35"> [01:01:35]</a>.
*   **Clear, actionable environmental policy guidelines:** The report provides practical guidance for governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33"> [01:00:33]</a>. The [[behavioral_public_policy | behavioral public policy]] toolkit is expanding beyond nudging to include "boosting" (competency-building, educative strategies) and "nudge plus" (prompting critical thinking alongside nudges) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04"> [01:02:04]</a>.

Opportunities and future considerations:
*   **Holistic use of [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]]:** While increasing, using [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] at all policy phases is not yet the norm, with room for more integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13"> [01:03:13]</a>. It's also important to recognize and address the biases of policymakers themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33"> [01:03:33]</a>.
*   **Regulating the supply side:** [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] can play a role in better regulating the supply side and suppliers, potentially through tools like "budges" that use [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] to restrict and regulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14"> [01:04:14]</a>.
*   **Testing policy combinations:** It's important to test combinations of fiscal and [[Behavioral public policy | behavioral policies]] and explore policy sequencing, building on the effectiveness of softer policies before harder ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42"> [01:04:42]</a>.

## Country Perspectives

### Australia: Josh Reynolds, Department of Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water
The OECD paper "Mind Shift Green: Lift Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy" arrives at a crucial moment for Australia's transition to a low-carbon economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07"> [01:07:07]</a>. The paper's central message is that the green transition is fundamentally a behavioral transition, requiring more than just new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:20"> [01:07:20]</a>. Success in supporting transitions (e.g., gas to electric appliances, energy-efficient technologies, adaptation strategies) hinges on understanding human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41"> [01:07:41]</a>.

Embedding [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] from the start of policy design leads to much better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:53"> [01:07:53]</a>. In Australia, public concern about climate change doesn't always translate into support for energy or environmental policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05"> [01:08:05]</a>. Given unique challenges in transitioning regional and resource-dependent economies, [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] are critical for designing policies that work for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18"> [01:08:18]</a>.

The OECD's evidence-backed frameworks are valuable for advocating [[Behavioral public policy | behavioral approaches]] in major policy reforms, especially in tight fiscal environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25"> [01:08:25]</a>. The framework around positive social tipping points is particularly relevant for Australia, potentially accelerating transitions in areas like rooftop solar adoption, electric vehicle uptake, and community energy projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:59"> [01:08:59]</a>.

Evaluation in Australian climate and energy policy is crucial, particularly with the 2022 Climate Change Act setting a 43% emissions reduction target by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17"> [01:09:17]</a>. This means measuring not just program participation but whether interventions lead to sustained changes in energy use, transport choices, and household consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31"> [01:09:31]</a>. For Australia's diverse communities, measuring both immediate impacts and longer-term behavioral shifts is essential for creating lasting changes toward a low-carbon economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00"> [01:10:00]</a>.

### Germany: Dr. Malte Patterson, German Federal Chancellery
The German federal government is delighted about the "Mind Shift Green: Lift" policy paper, as the green transition is a focus of the current government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07"> [01:11:07]</a>. The collection of case studies and trends shows that not every problem needs to be solved anew, and there's much to learn from existing good [[Behavioral public policy | behavioral policy]] designs within the [[international_collaboration_in_behavioral_policy | international community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15"> [01:11:15]</a>.

The German federal government, specifically its unit for citizen-centered policy design, is developing structures to leverage the use of [[Behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] from within:
1.  **Behavioral Science Network (BIG):** Called "behavioral insights connect for green transition," this network facilitates regular exchange between scientists and policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16"> [01:12:16]</a>. Policymakers can directly pass questions to a specialist group of [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral scientists]] who create peer-reviewed policy briefings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28"> [01:12:28]</a>. They are also piloting "social science surgery" workshops where scientists and policymakers jointly develop solutions, ensuring they are evidence-based, legal, and practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44"> [01:12:44]</a>.
2.  **Policy Check for Citizen-Centeredness:** Convinced that understanding people's reasons for their actions is a prerequisite for acceptable policies, they've developed tools encouraging policymakers to incorporate citizen insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21"> [01:13:21]</a>. These tools provide advice and resources for gaining insights through small-scale research projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45"> [01:13:45]</a>.

## Q&A Highlights

### Addressing the "Greenlash" and Engaging Governments
Martha Stoke from UNEP asked how to best position academic reports and assessments with governments given the "greenlash" against the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31"> [01:15:31]</a>.
Lucia Arian suggested that while [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] cannot change the worldwide agenda, it can show good examples where [[behavioral approaches]] have worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10"> [01:16:10]</a>. It's crucial to offer examples tailored to specific policy fields, regions, or countries, ensuring policymakers see a tangible benefit and addressing their concerns about low-risk, low-key interventions in contested areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49"> [01:16:49]</a>.

### Digital Technologies and AI in Environmental Policy
Arno Fontan asked about leveraging digital technologies and AI with [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to enhance environmental policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36"> [01:18:36]</a>.
Sanchayan Banerji noted the increasing discussion of AI's role in reshaping governance and in the [[Behavioral public policy | behavioral community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52"> [01:18:52]</a>. One key opportunity is personalizing interventions for different consumer groups, moving beyond a "one-size-fits-all" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10"> [01:19:10]</a>. Advances in computational social science and machine learning allow for training data sets to identify population clusters, enabling iteratively targeted and segmented interventions for greater effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33"> [01:19:33]</a>.

### Behavioral Interventions for Industries and Businesses
Rachel McAn inquired if [[behavioral interventions]] could work for industries and businesses, or if traditional regulatory solutions are always needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09"> [01:21:09]</a>.
It was affirmed that [[behavioral interventions]] can work for industries and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:30"> [01:21:30]</a>. Examples like default options can apply to both private households and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40"> [01:21:40]</a>. Lucia Arian added that a lot of [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights]] are used internally for "greening employee behavior," within industry associations, and in negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21"> [01:22:21]</a>. Wherever people make decisions impacting climate and the environment, [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights]] can be and are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50"> [01:22:50]</a>. The distinction lies in legitimacy: commercial entities using [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights]] is different from governments, who are responsible to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27"> [01:23:27]</a>.

### Frictions Between Climate Adaptation and Mitigation
Mikel Hendriks expressed concern that more attention is shifting to climate adaptation rather than mitigation, fearing that easier-to-support adaptation policies (local, quicker, visible effects) could divert resources from essential mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:12"> [01:24:12]</a>. He questioned if [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral scientists]] should warn policymakers about this potential imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:48"> [01:25:48]</a>.
It was acknowledged that climate adaptation is often seen as more acceptable politically, as even skeptics agree on the need to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:14"> [01:26:14]</a>. However, it's crucial for the applied [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] community to examine potential backfiring effects: how encouraging behaviors for adaptation might negatively impact mitigation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10"> [01:27:10]</a>. Lucia Arian emphasized that there should be a clear hierarchy: first avoiding (mitigation), then adapting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:53"> [01:27:53]</a>.

The OECD remains committed to advancing the use of [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to accelerate the green transition and deliver policies that are effective, evidence-based, impactful, inclusive, and behaviorally informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:56"> [01:28:56]</a>. Understanding human behavior is key to creating real-world solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17"> [01:29:17]</a>.

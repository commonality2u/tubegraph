Human behavior is recognized as a core target for governments addressing environmental threats, with sustainable lifestyles and consumption patterns playing a crucial role in tackling climate change, a recognition dating back to the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Since 2021, human behavior is understood to be part of the solution to almost any public governance measure related to climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This has made sustainability a top policy area for [[behavioral_public_policy | behavioral scientists]] over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Historical Context and Early Applications
Historically, [[behavioral_insights_for_public_policy | behavioral science]] has primarily been used to improve policies already implemented, rather than informing early policy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Successful examples of [[implementation_of_behavioral_science_in_government | behavioral science in government]] policy include:
*   **Feedback interventions** to reduce energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Better labeling of products** to encourage sustainable spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

One widely cited example is Opower, which originated from a 1990s study that tested interventions involving telling people their energy consumption compared to neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Opower partnered with energy utilities to send bills comparing individual energy use with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Meta-analyses show that this descriptive norms approach typically results in 2-6% energy reductions, especially if the user consumes more than their neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. The research evolved to include sophisticated comparisons, for example, between families of four with two kids living in similar climates and houses, making the comparison more legitimate and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. This approach is effective for changing large audiences' behavior slightly and can be quickly rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

Another example is the Home Power Savings Program in New South Wales, Australia, which involved home visits to 230,000 low-income households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Initial energy savings came from installing efficient kit (e.g., low-energy light globes), but the persuasive efforts were largely ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Behavioral scientists were brought in to design a strategy that trained assessors to use tools like [[behavioral_public_policy | commitment devices]], limiting choice, and social norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. By reducing a six-page list of choices to a pool of four or five options from which participants chose two or three to write down and stick on their fridge (a public commitment device), energy efficiency increased by about 4-5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This was then scaled across the entire program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

### Challenges and Limitations
Not all behavioral interventions are successful.
*   **Over-reliance on natural incentives**: While energy savings offer financial incentives, people are not always rational, and incentives often need to be significantly magnified to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. For example, heavily subsidized energy-efficient appliances (80-90% subsidy with no-interest loans) failed to convert low-income households due to aversion to any debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **Digital energy meters**: The universal rollout of digital energy meters in some places, based on the assumption that people would access data and become "energy zealots," failed, as very few accessed their data, and engagement quickly dropped off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.
*   **"Quick win" nudges**: Early studies using quick-win nudge interventions, such as letters with behaviorally informed messages to encourage heat pump installation, increased inquiries but did not lead to more installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. This suggests that removing one barrier (e.g., awareness) is often insufficient, and multiple barriers need to be tackled simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

## Future Pathways and Promising Domains
To address climate change, it is crucial to use [[role_of_behavioral_science_in_government_policy | behavioral science]] earlier in the policy process, particularly during the design phase of environmental policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This involves moving from "systemic behavioral solutions" to fostering "systemic change" by empowering public governance systems to lead with new choice architectures, where information, regulation, and financial incentives facilitate green habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Promising areas for the future of [[role_of_behavioral_insights_in_sustainable_energy_policies | behavioral science in environmental policy]] include:
*   **Behavior Change as a System Diagnostic**: Using behavioral science to understand *why* people don't change, identifying systemic drivers or structures preventing desired behaviors, and informing governments about other tools beyond incentives, persuasion, or regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Garnering Policy Support**: Using behavioral science to "soften the audience" or encourage policy support *before* implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Research suggests that people performing pro-environmental behaviors are more likely to support related policies, even when controlling for attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. This concept of "spillover" (leveraging one behavior to promote another) could be used to foster policy support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Identity also plays a crucial role in fostering the transition from one pro-environmental behavior to another and ultimately to policy support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.
*   **Providing New Tools for Green Policy Proposals**: This includes designing demand generation programs for new technologies like heat pumps and electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Pre-testing interventions, especially those aimed at improving comprehension and processing of information, can yield useful results, sometimes revealing counter-intuitive findings (e.g., simple tables outperforming complex clocks for time-of-use tariffs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   **Policy Agenda Setting**: Applying a behavioral insights lens to policy problems to understand barriers and drivers of behaviors throughout a process (e.g., from considering to installing and correctly using a heat pump) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Key Topical Areas**:
    *   **Climate Change and Energy Use**: Currently high in public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.
    *   **[[role_of_behavioral_science_in_climate_adaptation | Biodiversity]]**: Major reports highlighting significant biodiversity loss and upcoming international targets (e.g., Kunming replacing Aichi targets) create a policy window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.
    *   **Waste Management**: Previously topical due to policies like China's "China Sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.
    *   **Water Consumption**: Significant during drought periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.
*   **Digital Nudges with Immediate Feedback**: Can serve as standalone tools, particularly in environmental areas, by providing quick, fast, and valuable feedback on actions and improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. These can also be personalized and improve traditional educational tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **Beyond Nudging (Behavioral Thinking)**: A general approach of empirical testing and acknowledging that humans are not perfectly rational ("econs") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. This includes involving people (citizens, stakeholders) in the design process ("nudge plus") to foster participation and endorsement of changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.
*   **Sludge Assessment**: Identifying and removing unnecessary barriers and bureaucratic "sludge" that hinder desired behaviors, whether for households or decision-makers in companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.
*   **Systemic Interventions**: Instead of single nudges, employing multi-pronged interventions that combine behavioral insights (e.g., defaults, incentives, social norms) with concrete measures to remove financial and logistical barriers (e.g., ensuring contractor availability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Examples like the US "Solarize programs" demonstrate the effectiveness of community group buying schemes for solar panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

### Behavioral Science and Other Actors
While consumer behavior is important, industrial emissions are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. Models of individual behavior can translate well to explaining organizational behavior, as businesses respond to factors like perceived good, social pressure, and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. Organizations are particularly responsive to normative influences (e.g., rivals adopting policies) and customer pressure (e.g., opting for greener products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

However, [[behavioral_public_policy | behavioral insights]] should not be seen as an "easy way out" to avoid "hard" regulation like carbon taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. Behavioral insights can help design financial incentives and disincentives (e.g., carbon taxes) in a smarter way, such as by framing them as a "climate bonus" paid upfront to households, linked clearly to climate action, and preventing energy poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations
Customer segmentation in [[behavioral_public_policy | behavioral science]] raises challenges for equitable services. While targeting groups more likely to switch or cause the most emissions can be effective, it presents ethical questions about fairness (e.g., giving something to some people but not others) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. A key ethical guideline is to ensure interventions only make some people *better off* rather than making others *worse off* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>. Transparency in communication is also vital, as people dislike being tricked or manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>.

## Call to Action for Policymakers
*   **Embed behavioral insights into the policy process**: Make it a standard step, like conducting a cost-benefit analysis, rather than an ad-hoc, "nice to have" addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. This includes creating toolkits for policymakers to understand the behavioral assumptions behind different policy approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.
*   **Implement green defaults**: Integrating green defaults in all policies (procurement, schools, etc.) leverages choice architecture to change mindsets and facilitate learning through action, which is a quicker process than changing values first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.
*   **Combine tools**: Use a full toolkit: good laws, smart regulation, and financial resources, not relying solely on soft behavioral approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>.
*   **Be transparent**: Be clear about policy intentions, especially regarding financial implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.
*   **Co-design with citizens**: Engage citizens and other actors from the very beginning, especially at local levels, as they are "experts of everyday life" and can identify real problems and barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.
*   **Interdisciplinary approach**: Integrate insights from other disciplines like human-centered design and architecture, which understand how people move and interact with spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.
*   **Focus on high-impact behaviors**: Prioritize behavioral changes that offer the greatest impact and are feasible to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>. An example is the city of Townsville, Australia, which focused on getting residents to paint their roofs white (or use pale roofing for new builds) due to its significant energy-saving impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>. The entire city rallied around this single challenge, engaging small businesses, supply chains, and communications to maximize adoption, leading to a noticeable change in the city's appearance from above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.

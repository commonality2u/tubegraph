This article is based on insights shared during the "Government Aftershock high level Forum," a global dialogue aimed at understanding what the crisis has revealed about the role and expectations of government, both currently and in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The event was titled "building back better together and reaffirming the role of Citizen centered governance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Key Learnings on [[Government responses to COVID19]] and Citizen-Centered Governance

The [[Government response to the Covid19 crisis]] has profoundly impacted how administrations view and engage with their citizens. A poll conducted during the forum revealed that 89.3% of participants believe there is a greater need to engage with citizens now than before COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. While 18.8% felt their government made great efforts to involve citizens, nearly 60% observed engagement in a limited way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.

### Limitations and Challenges
Mr. Molina Rodriguez, Deputy Minister of National Planning and Economic Policy from Costa Rica, highlighted that the crisis revealed limitations in existing service delivery mechanisms to meet every citizen's expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Public services under stress also showed that some tasks could be automated, but this risks social and economic consequences by distancing public officials from citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. He emphasized the need for a plan to transition with fewer undesirable side effects, asking who democracy is centered on, particularly considering those without access to services, refugees, foreigners, low-income individuals, and informal workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Governments alone cannot meet all expectations and must boost shared responsibility frameworks like Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), decent work legislation, and blended finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Mona Benara, Civil Society Innovation Lead at Civicus, pointed out that while there's increased engagement, there are also significant restrictions on freedoms introduced to face the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. This includes censorship and restricted access to information, undermining accountability and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Threats and arrests for criticizing state responses (e.g., doctors protesting lack of PPE in Pakistan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, restrictions on media, and the use of restrictive laws against "fake news" to control digital space have been documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Police abuses during lockdowns and violations of privacy rights through new apps are also concerning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### Adaptations and Innovations
Gary Gillespie, Chief Economist for the Government of Scotland, noted that Scotland already had a strong focus on citizen participation through its national performance framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The crisis magnified this need, requiring deeper, quicker, and more paced engagement for citizen understanding and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Scotland implemented additional engagement measures, including weekly polls on understanding and compliance with government messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The First Minister leads daily press briefings, explaining policy rationale, and senior officials explain impacts of restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This approach of higher compliance, trust, and information availability helps with understanding and cohesiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Scotland's policing approach during COVID-19 is based on "four Es": engage, explain, encourage, and only if needed, enforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. This embodies a citizen-based approach, reflected in consistently high public trust in the Scottish government (around 70%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. The government's core principle, developed through citizen consultation, is to be a society that treats people with kindness, dignity, and compassion, respecting the rule of law and acting transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. This pre-existing framework was crucial during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.

### The Role of Citizen Engagement
Engaging citizens has several beneficial effects, including providing feedback on government performance and service delivery, and sustaining support for democratic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Instituitions under stress should seriously consider how they communicate and if they are being understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. Policymaking has become technically complex, so making it understandable for non-expert populations is vital for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

Jane Suiter, Director of The Institute for Media and Journalism in Dublin City University, observed that while the urgent aspects of the pandemic forced out strategic thinking, many governments are conducting polls and market research to gauge public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. However, there hasn't been enough time for detailed deliberative participation where the citizen voice can truly be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

### Addressing Misinformation and Building Trust
A significant challenge during the pandemic is misperceptions and misinformation, which drive non-compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Research suggests that involving citizens directly with experts, allowing them to ask questions and report back to peers, is very powerful in correcting misperceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. This brings citizens into the process of correcting misinformation and engaging with scientific consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. It's an opportunity for governments to tackle the "infodemic" and listen more deeply to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

### Strengthening Citizen Engagement for [[Resilience and innovation in pandemic response]]
To strengthen citizen engagement practices for future crises, it's crucial to have robust mechanisms in place beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. The OECD has published specifics on various types of engagement, from participatory budgeting to mini-publics and citizen assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. Digital platforms are essential now, but face challenges in ensuring equality of voice and preventing takeover by vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. Solutions include using moderators and actively reaching out to ordinary citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.

Another key [[Public sector innovation during Covid19]] is conducting in-depth survey work, providing citizens with evidence before asking for their input, and explicitly linking government actions to citizen feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. This builds trust and avoids cynicism caused by ignoring public input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.

### Hybrid Approaches to Engagement
For virtual engagement to be effective and inclusive, it's vital to acknowledge the existing digital gap due to infrastructure, access, and usability issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. Real inclusion means recognizing this gap and leveraging community-based organizations and local activists as "champions" to connect directly with people and bring their voices into virtual spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>. Innovative offline solutions, some tested in extreme environments like internet shutdowns, are also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>. An effective approach requires a hybrid balance between virtual and offline methods, mindful of the intersectionality of inclusion (e.g., women, youth, elderly, rural populations, those without device access) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.

### Civil Society's [[Innovative responses to Covid19 by governments]]
Civil Society organizations demonstrated high agility in responding to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. They were quick to respond, providing humanitarian emergency support and reaching the most vulnerable, often marginalized populations overlooked by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. Examples include food distribution for single mothers in Morocco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. Civil society also acted as a safeguard against misinformation, using innovative campaigns and awareness methods like graffiti in various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. They engaged in accountability and transparency monitoring, ensuring proper distribution of aid and requesting visibility for foreign funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. Despite restrictions on civic space, citizens and civil society continued to assist governments, driven by the desire to see impact and change on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

### Fostering Humility and Collaboration
Promoting humility and listening in government is challenging in competitive democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>. Governments must have mechanisms for direct citizen feedback on services and policymaking participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>. Giving responsibility back to citizens has proven wise, as seen in protocols being applied and overseen by citizens in public places and transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. People want to be part of implementation and monitoring, especially when institutions are overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. Governments should create general frameworks where citizens can clearly understand how to contribute as workers, enterprises, and employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated changes in how governments engage with citizens, and a return to more formal, siloed methods is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. The ability to act at speed and receive quick feedback has been demonstrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. It is acceptable not to have all answers from the start, allowing processes to evolve with evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

### Towards a More Inclusive Future
The learning curve for governments is slow due to their structure and mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. Optimism for the future relies on governments becoming more responsive to civil society and citizens, opening opportunities for radical collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. The crisis, along with challenges like climate change, necessitates a shift from "listening approaches" designed as market beneficiary demand and offer models, to true, effective, or radical partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. This means moving beyond tokenism to genuinely involve vulnerable populations and co-designing solutions and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Responsible digitalization that respects data and privacy is also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:59">[02:09:59]</a>.

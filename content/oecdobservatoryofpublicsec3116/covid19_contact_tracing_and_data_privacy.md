The [[Digitization and use of technology during Covid19 | COVID-19]] pandemic brought significant challenges for governments, including widespread uncertainty and difficulties in controlling the spread of the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Initially, manual contact tracing was a slow process, taking approximately five to six days to gather credible data on transmission chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This inefficiency highlighted the urgent need for a more effective approach to track the highly infectious virus, which spreads in a geometric progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Singapore's `TraceTogether` Application

Singapore's Government Technology Agency developed the `TraceTogether` app in just four weeks, demonstrating that governments can act rapidly in a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The app's primary goal was to enhance contact tracing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

Key aspects of Singapore's approach:
*   **Widespread Adoption** Out of a population of 5.5 million, approximately 2.7 million people use the `TraceTogether` app on their phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Inclusive Access** Recognizing that some individuals, such as older or younger people, might not have effective phone use, Singapore also created a physical token running the same protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Around 800,000 people utilize this token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Data Pervasiveness** Roughly 60% of Singapore's population now carries a contact tracing device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. It is estimated that approximately 70% pervasiveness is necessary for contact tracing to be truly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Impact** The contact tracing cycle has been significantly reduced from five to six days to less than two days, currently averaging 1.2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This rapid tracing allows for quick isolation of infected individuals, effectively cutting transmission chains that could otherwise affect hundreds of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This success has contributed to Singapore achieving zero local COVID-19 transmissions for weeks, with only incoming cases being isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### Data Privacy Measures

A critical element of `TraceTogether`'s success is its approach to data privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Data collected by the app is decentralized, residing on the user's device rather than being stored centrally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Information is only downloaded and associated with other people when a user tests positive for COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This method aims to build [[Public sector data use and transformation | trust]] among citizens regarding the handling of their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Challenges to Data Privacy and Trust

Despite successful models, concerns about data privacy and public trust remain a significant challenge for [[Government responses to COVID19 | governments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

### France's Experience with `StopCOVID`

In France, the `StopCOVID` contact tracing application faced challenges due to a centralized infrastructure choice, which raised concerns about vulnerability to attacks and leaks of sensitive health data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. This centralization contributed to a lack of public trust in the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. Low adoption (few downloads) led to the notification system not working effectively, with only one percent of contacts being traced nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

The French government's communication style, characterized by a "vocabulary not fun at all," contributed to mistrust and a lack of willingness to download the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. As of the discussion, only 35% of French people trusted their government's handling of the crisis, partly due to a lack of transparent data and contradictory information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. This has fueled the spread of conspiracy theories and fake news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

### Broader Privacy Concerns

The crisis has also highlighted broader issues regarding data security and sovereignty:
*   **Homeworking Challenges** Increased homeworking for civil servants exposed vulnerabilities, such as saturated VPNs leading to confidential court files being sent via Gmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.
*   **Limited Adoption of Secure Tools** Despite efforts to develop secure, state-hosted messenger apps (e.g., France's `Tchap`), uptake among civil servants has been minimal (170 users out of 5 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.
*   **New Technologies and Regulation** The pandemic has seen the development and testing of new technologies like facial recognition in subways to enforce mask-wearing, and drones for monitoring lockdown compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. These uses have been contested by civil society due to a lack of clear regulation on filming, judicial oversight, and image access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>. Debates are ongoing in legislative bodies, like the French National Assembly, to regulate drone usage and data harvesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

[[Ethical use and protection of personal data | Ethical use of data]] and algorithms is paramount for trust and social good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. While privacy is a fundamental human right, it is the foundation for trust, which in turn enables the ethical use of technology and data for social good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Future Commitments

The [[Government responses to COVID19 | COVID-19 responses and government adaptability | crisis]] has accelerated [[Public sector data use and transformation | digital transformation]] and highlighted the potential of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. However, it is acknowledged that overcoming long-standing issues like bureaucracy, silos, and limited infrastructure will require sustained effort beyond the immediate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

Key commitments and takeaways for the future include:
*   **Continued Investment in Infrastructure** Building and maintaining robust data infrastructure, including single sources of truth, data exchange platforms (like Singapore's `APEX` API gateway), and a strategic vision for leveraging data, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>. Political support, especially from top leadership, is vital for long-term investment in digital infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>.
*   **Building Trust and Transparency** Governments must build [[Public sector data use and transformation | trust]] with citizens by ensuring transparent data handling, respecting privacy, and being open to ideas from civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. Legislating to guarantee data protection while new technologies develop is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>.
*   **Focus on Questions and Purpose** Governments need to become more sophisticated in formulating the right questions that data can answer, engaging internal and external stakeholders to source these questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. This clarity of purpose can drive effective [[Publicprivate partnerships for data sharing | data collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Developing Human Infrastructure** Creating designated roles, like "chief data stewards," within the private sector can accelerate [[Publicprivate partnerships for data sharing | data collaboratives]] by streamlining relationship building and addressing legal, ethical, and corporate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. Training civil servants to formulate problems using data and ask the right questions is also critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>.
*   **International Cooperation** There is an urgent call for stronger international public-private-civil society relationships to enable the trusted, free, systematic, sustainable, and responsible flow of data globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>. This is vital for addressing global challenges like vaccine distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.
*   **Humanity and Equity** Data use must prioritize humanity and equity, ensuring that services address injustices and inequalities in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. Technology is a tool to bring people together, not to replace the human element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:35">[01:23:35]</a>. Responsible innovation involves building participation into the design of public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>.

Overall, the pandemic has demonstrated the value of data and the possibility of rapid transformation, but sustained investment, cultural shifts, and a commitment to [[Ethical use and protection of personal data | trust]] and [[impact_of_covid19_on_governmentcitizen_relationships | collaboration]] are needed for long-term change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

The modern era, particularly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, has revealed that the traditional 20th-century models of government, designed for predictable environments with established routines and available knowledge bases, are fundamentally flawed. The notion of stability is fictional, and the future is highly uncertain, requiring governments to actively embrace this unpredictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Embracing Uncertainty: The "Never Normal"
The pandemic has shown that the idea of a "normal" is a myth; instead of moving from one stable equilibrium to another, societies are in a state of "never normal" – continuous fluidity, flux, and turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This new reality necessitates constant adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

Traditional war metaphors for crises like pandemics are mistaken, as there is no clear enemy or finite end point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. A better approach is to view challenges as part of a complex, natural living ecosystem requiring human and living solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This understanding underscores a biological interdependence and, crucially, a moral interdependence, recognizing that everyone is in relationship with one another and the most vulnerable are often disproportionately affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Outdated Worldviews and the Need for Learning
Historically, societal structures and governance models operated on the assumption of control and the expectation that political decision-makers had "right answers" and could plan and budget with certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. However, the COVID-19 crisis specifically taught that "nobody knew when it started what it is about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, necessitating a shift to a worldview where learning is essential, especially "emergent learning" where what is best constantly changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## The Importance of Trust and Relationships
In this uncertain environment, a critical component for effective governance is [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust]]. For [[building_trust_in_government_response | building trust in government response]] and across society, it is crucial to establish strong relationships between different actors, including various government layers, the public and private sectors, and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. [[trust_and_power_in_citizengovernment_relationships | Trust]] is built on credibility (ability to act), reliability (keeping promises), and intimacy (understanding each other's viewpoints) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

Finland, for example, has a long tradition of future work within its government and parliament, which helped during the pandemic by fostering an understanding that decisions need to adapt as new evidence emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. This means [[trust_and_transparency_in_public_policy | trust and transparency in public policy]] do not mean rigidly sticking to initial statements, but openly acknowledging changes based on new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

## Shifting from Performance to Capacity Management
To navigate uncertainty, governments need to move from a focus on "performance management" to "capacity management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This shift is crucial because hierarchy, often inherent in performance-driven models, hinders learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. By increasing learning capacity, public organizations can constantly develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

This requires several mindset shifts:
*   **From Optimization to Resilience**: Instead of pairing resources down, maintain ramp-up or spillover capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **From Quantitative to Qualitative Indicators**: Incorporate ethnographic stories and qualitative data alongside quantitative metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **From Output to Outcomes**: Focus on the broader impacts rather than just immediate deliverables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
*   **From Linear to Exponential Approaches**: Recognize that small inputs can have profound, non-linear effects in a systemic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **From Scarcity/Fixed Mindsets to Abundance/Growth Mindsets**: Embrace learning, change, and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
*   **From Stable Equilibrium to Iterative Work**: Accept that solutions may not be perfect initially, but require continuous adjustment and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   **From Silo to Integration**: Move beyond narrow performance sections to allow local sub-optimization for global benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

## Governments as Facilitators and Stewards
A significant portion of the audience (78%) believes government should be in the lead role, actively embracing and shaping uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. This aligns with the concept of an "entrepreneurial state" that empowers itself to make a difference through leading investment and playing a strong facilitative role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

In a complex world, government's leadership role transforms. It moves beyond traditional functions of regulation and order to become an "ecosystem steward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. This means:
*   **Cross-Agency Coordination**: Thinking and working across government departments (whole-of-government approach) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
*   **Whole-of-Nation Coordination**: Facilitating collaboration among multiple sectors, private actors, community groups, and individual citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.
*   **Convening and Aggregating Interests**: Acting as a platform to bring diverse parties together for dialogue and synthesizing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

## Citizen Engagement and Co-creation
[[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | Democratic innovations and citizen engagement]] are vital for [[building_trust_in_public_institutions | building trust in public institutions]]. People are more likely to buy into and [[citizencentered_governance_and_engagement | trust citizen-centered governance and engagement]] when they are involved in its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. This requires participatory government, where governments present problems and invite collective deliberation to find solutions, rather than simply giving people what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

Co-creation processes, particularly at the local level in cities, have proven effective in generating tangible results and [[citizen_trust_and_public_communication | fostering citizen trust and public communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. These efforts need to be connected through national and international layers of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.

## Communicating Uncertainty and Building Trust
For governments to manage the balancing act between taking risks in uncertain times and maintaining [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | citizen trust and its impact on governance]], it is crucial to communicate transparently. This includes acknowledging that decisions may change as new evidence emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. Citizens, surprisingly often, can engage with complex issues in deliberative dialogues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

Furthermore, changing citizen behavior, essential for addressing major issues like climate change or inequality, goes beyond traditional methods of authority or rational persuasion. It requires a "learning" model that creates experiences for citizens to see how things could be done differently, fostering internal motivation for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. This must pay special attention to the most vulnerable, ensuring their voices are heard and included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.

## Addressing Unequal Impacts
A key commitment for leaders in uncertain times is to constantly consider the differential effects of policies and events. Crises like pandemics often impact the "least, last, and lost" – the most vulnerable – disproportionately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. Policymaking must explicitly account for these varied effects across different communities to ensure policies lead to human-centric outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.

## Conclusion
The future of governance in a "never normal" world hinges on the ability of governments to embrace uncertainty, move from control to facilitation, and fundamentally change how they operate. This involves strong leadership that can balance competing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>, a commitment to continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>, and a deep focus on building quality relationships and fostering [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust]] through extensive [[citizencentered_governance_and_engagement | citizen engagement]] and co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>.

The future of public employment is a significant topic discussed within forums like the "Government Aftershocks" series, which convenes a global dialogue on the crisis and the evolving role and expectations of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Discussions from these sessions contribute to the development of a call for action for governments by the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

A poll conducted during one session asked participants about the medium-term impacts of the coronavirus crisis on public employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Approximately half of respondents believed it would lead to a more flexible and resilient public sector employment model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>. About 40% anticipated a more [[skills_for_the_future_in_the_public_sector | digitally savvy public sector workforce]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>. Few expected new rounds of austerity measures, and almost no one thought there would be little impact on the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from the Crisis

The crisis has profoundly shifted the understanding of the public service and public employment:

*   **Agility and Responsiveness**
    *   Public administration can be agile and responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   Stereotypes of being rigid and incapable of quick adaptation were broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   In Slovenia, nearly 70% of civil servants shifted to remote work practically overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. A poll found over half of civil servants reported higher engagement, efficiency, and satisfaction while teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   Public employees are flexible, adaptive, and innovative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Critical Role of Public Service**
    *   The crisis brought into sharp focus the critical role of the public service in meeting community needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
    *   The reputation of the civil service increased significantly in Slovenia due to its quick response in providing anti-coronal law packages and ensuring critical infrastructure functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   People understood that public employees are essential to communities and societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Collaboration**
    *   Working together improves effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The Australian Public Service rallied as "one APS" during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   There was a huge increase in cross-collaboration between agencies, government departments, and voluntary groups in Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   Crisis often fosters collaboration within large organizations, overcoming typical challenges of competing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Digitalization and Remote Work**
    *   Public services quickly adopted [[challenges_and_opportunities_of_digitalization_in_public_services | digital skills]] for new communication methods, video meetings, and distance training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   Remote work can be efficient for the civil service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. The crisis demonstrated the importance of staff having solid foundational [[skills_for_the_future_in_the_public_sector | digital and data skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

## Developing Resilience and Future Skills

To further develop [[public_sector_challenges_and_transformations | resilience]] in public workforces and prepare for the future, several key areas are identified:

*   **Learning Organizations and Skills**
    *   The civil service should become a learning organization, investing in people, their skills, and their workplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
    *   New skills, such as critical thinking, creativity, judgment, and responsive innovation, will be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
    *   The most important [[skills_for_the_future_in_the_public_sector | skill for the future of public employment]] is the ability to continuously learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
    *   Promoting intergenerational cooperation, coaching, and mentorship is vital to ensure no one is left behind due to a lack of [[challenges_and_opportunities_of_digitalization_in_public_services | digital skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Management Practices**
    *   Managers need to be able to manage through change and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
    *   [[Leadership and teamwork in public administration | Soft skills]] like learning agility, emotional intelligence, influencing, and communicating are increasingly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
    *   There is a need to support and train middle management in distributed [[leadership and teamwork in public administration | leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   More emphasis should be placed on crisis management skills for civil service leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. Leaders must build trust in employees, motivate them, and communicate effectively, especially with remote teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.
*   **Investment and Policy**
    *   Developing [[public_sector_challenges_and_transformations | resilience]] requires the political will to invest in public services and administration, reversing decades of cuts and understaffing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
    *   Emergencies should not be used as political tools for competition between different levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
    *   Digitalization and high-tech solutions need to be further strengthened and developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

## Opportunities and Risks for Rethinking Public Employment

### Opportunities

*   **Flexible Work Models:** The adoption of remote work at scale presents an opportunity to design job policies that leverage both remote and in-office work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. A balance of working from home and in the office is likely the new norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
*   **Expanded Talent Pool:** Remote work opens up new markets for recruitment, as location becomes less restrictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Public Service Hubs:** Creating public service hubs closer to where people live can reduce commuting time and offer connection points for public servants from different agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>. This is being explored in Australia and Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Mobility:** The crisis demonstrated the effectiveness of mobilizing workforces across agencies, creating a "surge reserve" for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.
*   **One Public Service Approach:** The crisis brought different departments and agencies together, fostering a "one APS" mentality in Australia, which senior executives are keen to continue for efficiency and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
*   **Professionalization:** Building professional streams (e.g., HR, project management, cyber security) within the public service is a focus for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

### Risks and Pitfalls to Avoid

*   **Work-Life Balance and Burnout:** Remote work presents challenges for work-life balance, especially for those juggling family responsibilities like childcare, and can lead to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.
*   **Inequity of Remote Work:** Teleworking can have disproportionate impacts, particularly on women who often bear the burden of family care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. Lack of adequate equipment, suitable physical space, and proper regulation of working conditions are concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   **Social Isolation:** The lack of social interaction and informal networks (like coffee table conversations) when working remotely can be detrimental to team cohesion and idea generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.
*   **Visibility and Promotion Bias:** A concern exists that remote workers might be "out of sight, out of mind," leading to potential disadvantages in promotion and career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
*   **"Re-traditionalization of roles":** There is a risk of reverting to traditional roles or structures if not actively managed, which could hinder progress made during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>.
*   **Aging Workforce and Skill Gaps:** Public administrations, like Italy's, face an aging workforce, which can mean fewer adaptable workers, particularly concerning [[challenges_and_opportunities_of_digitalization_in_public_services | digital skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>. However, many workers proved capable of adapting with minimal training when urgency arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>.
*   **Political Interference:** Emergencies should not become political tools for competition between parties or different levels of government, as this negatively impacts the effectiveness of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.
*   **Loss of Credibility:** A past problem of public administration has been the loss of government credibility, which needs to be addressed through a changed narrative and social recognition of public service workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
*   **Underinvestment:** Decades of cuts, understaffing, and high turnover have weakened public services, as evidenced during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. Avoiding "austerity workforce reductions and pay cuts" is crucial for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.
*   **Lack of Regulation and Collective Bargaining:** Unregulated working conditions, especially for teleworking, can exacerbate problems like domestic violence (due to lack of shelters/services when women are obliged to stay home) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. The ability of workers to organize and engage in collective bargaining is vital for addressing these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>.

## Personal Commitments for the Future

Panelists expressed personal commitments for the future of public administration:

*   **Focus on People:** It is "all about the people" in civil service, emphasizing the importance of selecting the right people for the right positions and continuously supporting their adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>.
*   **Promote Positive Stories:** Telling positive stories of public service achievements to build recognition and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
*   **Foster Diversity and Support Leaders:** Ensuring [[leadership_and_teamwork_in_public_administration | diversity of thought]], recognizing that [[leadership and teamwork in public administration | leadership]] can emerge from unexpected places, and supporting the mental and physical well-being of leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.
*   **Prepare for Instability:** Recognizing that instability can happen regardless of will, and committing to providing public servants with the skills and capacity to respond to multifaceted threats like climate crises, social instabilities, and natural disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. This requires a strong public administration structure and collaborative efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>.

Improving existing systems, often referred to as "enhancement-oriented innovation," is a prevalent practice in government innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This approach focuses on upgrading what already exists and enhancing current practices and systems within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Characteristics of Enhancement-Oriented Innovation

The primary goal is to make existing systems work better, faster, or more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Examples include:
*   Making taxation systems operate more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Utilizing behavioral insights to encourage faster tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Improving responses to inquiries in a more informed manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Risk and Implementation

A key characteristic of this form of [[government_innovation_practices | government innovation practices]] is its relatively low risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These innovations do not typically call for a complete transformation of systems; instead, they are implemented within the current structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The risks associated with their implementation can often be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

This approach allows for directed innovation to improve a specific type of system or to [[developing_new_ideas | exploit existing ideas]] to enhance current operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

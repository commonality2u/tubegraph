Successfully advancing an innovation requires effectively rallying people to its cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This can be a nerve-wracking time as you introduce something new and ask others to embrace an idea they may not be comfortable with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The goal is to secure the necessary resources for your proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Key Strategies for Rallying Support

### 1. Understand the Strategic Context
It is crucial to understand the strategic context in which your idea operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Even the best idea may not gain traction if the context isn't right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
Consider:
*   Related agendas you can align with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   Political or executive leadership messages to link your idea to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   How to frame or reframe your idea to match the current context, or at least appear to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### 2. Communicate Effectively with Your Audience
A key challenge with innovation is its novelty; there are often no ready mental models or examples for people to reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Therefore, it's vital to appreciate how to communicate with your audience and tailor your message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

Consider:
*   **Decision-maker preferences**: Do they prefer data, stories about pain points, or examples of other agencies' successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>?
*   **Effective voice**: Determine who would be the most effective voice for your proposal; it might not always be you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Someone else might be better at selling the idea or advocating for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### 3. Make Your Idea Real and Understandable
Do not assume the merits of your idea are apparent or easily understandable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Innovative ideas, by being novel, are easily misinterpreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Others may lack the personal experience or research you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Ways to make your proposal real and meaningful:
*   **Prototyping**: Make it visible and tangible through prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Peer voices**: Find other peer voices who can help sell the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Concrete use cases**: Point to instances where current solutions are failing and show examples of where this initiative has worked elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Scenario planning**: Think through different future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### 4. Know Your Numbers
Have a strong sense of what you're asking for, why, and the expected results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Be prepared for questions, as the burden of proof for innovation is often higher than for the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Consider:
*   **Cost of current approach**: Highlight the costs and risks of continuing with the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Start small**: Propose starting with a small test case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Promise with confidence**: Sometimes, especially with uncertainty, it's about confidently making the case for why you believe it will work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Look for examples**: Find examples in other agencies, countries, or the private sector where similar ideas have succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### 5. Be Ready for the Unexpected
Anticipate potential outcomes: What if they say yes and want it to go much bigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>? What if you learn something new that undercuts your hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>?

### 6. Maximize Your Chances and Deliver Value
In the public sector, people want to see results, not just "fast failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Think about how to extract learning and value even if the idea doesn't work as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

Consider:
*   **Learning as a goal**: Frame learning as a primary goal, especially when dealing with high uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Develop relationships**: Use the proposal to develop relationships with other players, stakeholders, or parts of your agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Multiple payoffs**: Identify multiple benefits your initiative can deliver, regardless of its primary success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### 7. Be Open to Change and Input
Don't try to anticipate everything; leave space for those receiving the proposal to provide input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Senior leaders often want to add their perspective and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Tailoring Tips to Proposal Format
The core principles for [[developing_innovation_proposals | innovation proposals]] hold true across different formats (written, presentation, lightning pitch), but the amount of attention and depth given to each point will vary based on the scale of the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. For a large budget proposal, strategic context and rallying support require much greater consideration than for a small team idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## Overcoming Rejection

When an innovation proposal is rejected, especially if you strongly believe in it, consider the following:
*   **Timing**: Sometimes it's the right idea at the wrong time; waiting may be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Reframe**: Try to reframe your idea to better suit the current context, listening to political signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Build a Coalition**: If you're too far ahead of your audience, build a coalition of supportive people who understand the idea's importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **Outside Voices**: Find external stakeholders or organizations who appreciate and want the idea to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   **Workarounds**: Explore lateral thinking or "going around" the initial rejection if appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Know when to wait**: Recognize when to put the idea aside and wait for a different context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Common Issues with Proposals

### 1. Decision-makers' Understanding
Decision-makers may not fully grasp what they've agreed to, leading to surprise or confusion later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. This happens because new ideas can be heard differently than intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. Watch for warning signs of this disconnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

### 2. Lack of Flexibility
Innovation projects will inevitably encounter unexpected issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Avoid building critical dependencies into your proposal that make you vulnerable to surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Being too specific without leaving room for adaptation can cause trouble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

### 3. Missing an Escape Clause
It's important to build in a way to exit a project if it doesn't go as hoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.
*   **Stopping non-working projects**: In the public sector, there's a tendency to continue investing in projects even if they're not working, which is a bad idea for innovative projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
*   **Project divergence**: If the project goes in a worthwhile but uninteresting direction, an out allows you to disengage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   **Avoiding dependency**: If a project becomes successful but is solely tied to you, it's not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. Build in "escape avenues" so you don't trap yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

### 4. Balancing Information for Decision-makers
Find the right balance in the information provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Avoid patronizing leaders, but don't assume they know everything about a new idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. Testing your proposal with both familiar and unfamiliar audiences can help strike this balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

### 5. Beware of Scope Creep
Scope creep can happen in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>:
*   **Expansion**: Adding too many features or ideas can make the project unrecognizable and dangerous for an innovation meant to test key things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Dilution**: Cutting out the parts that make the project interesting or meaningful can lead to investment in something no longer innovative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. Identify critical dependencies that could make or break the project and try to make decision-makers aware of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

## Managing Expectations and "Failure"

[[Government_innovation_motivations | Government]] often uses "innovation" as a buzzword, but its true meaning—uncertainty and discomfort—is frequently misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

### 1. Setting Realistic Timeframes
For innovations with high uncertainty, avoid setting yourself up for failure by promising fixed, short timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
*   **Prototype and Test**: Utilize low-fidelity testing and prototyping (e.g., wireframes, play-acting service interactions) early on to gain information about steps, dependencies, and potential timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. This helps flesh out the reality of the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>.

### 2. Reframing Failure
Government often avoids the word "failure," but it's crucial to reframe what failure means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.
*   **Limited Exposure**: When you start small and test, if things don't work, you've limited your exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.
*   **Learning as an Outcome**: Recognize that learning is a valuable outcome, especially in high-uncertainty projects where the outcome is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Nuance Success and Failure**: The difference between success and failure can be minimal, influenced by chance and external events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. Look for many shades of success and failure, acknowledging that efforts can have multiple payoffs beyond the primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.

### 3. Building Confidence
If you are new to innovation or your organization, start small with experiments within your own job context where you have discretion and don't need permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. This builds confidence, which is important for pitching ideas, as people are more likely to believe in those who are confident in what they're selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

[[overcoming_innovation_challenges | Overcoming innovation challenges]] often involves building a common language around what innovation truly entails: something uncertain and potentially uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. Bringing in external voices (stakeholders, partner organizations, other agencies) who have experience with innovative projects can help shape more realistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

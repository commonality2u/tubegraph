## Introduction to Mission-Oriented Innovation
[[Missionoriented innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is a concept focused on addressing urgent, complex societal problems, such as climate change or inequality, by directing growth and fostering innovation towards specific, ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. It requires a "market shaping" framework, moving beyond traditional "market fixing" approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This approach aims to create markets, rather than just fixing existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

The concept emphasizes that growth should not merely have a rate, but also a direction, especially given global challenges like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Implementing [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] involves significant changes in public organizations, policymaking, and collaboration between public and private sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Key [[challenges_in_implementing_missiondriven_approaches | Challenges in Implementing Mission-Oriented Policies]]
Implementing [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] is complex and presents numerous [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation | challenges]]. A three-hour workshop cannot solve all issues connected to missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The core challenge is the need for a fundamental shift in how public and private entities work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

### Strategic Orientation Challenges
*   **Defining Missions**: While the ideal [[definition_of_mission_oriented_innovation | definition of mission-oriented innovation]] suggests clear, ambitious, and concrete goals with defined timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>, many initiatives are often broad "mission areas" without clear targets or deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>. This can lead to "mission washing," where existing industry targets are merely rebranded as missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>.
*   **Focus on Problems vs. Solutions**: Missions should pick problems, not solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>. However, many current mission-oriented policies remain primarily focused on technological and scientific solutions, rather than opening up to broader societal solutions that might require changes in consumption or production behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. This is partly due to these policies often being under the authority of science, technology, and innovation agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:23">[01:03:23]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Mission Creation**: Mission creation is not a one-off stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. It's a long, sequential process, often bottom-up, where the real mission and its targets only become clear at the project level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.
*   **Overarching Frameworks**: Broad, overarching mission-oriented frameworks risk inflation and dilution of missions, as enlisting many stakeholders can make it difficult to maintain focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.

### Governance and Coordination Challenges
*   **Siloed Structures**: Government structures, human resource incentives, and procurement processes are often "anti-collaboration," incentivizing departments to maintain their silos rather than break them to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
*   **Multi-Level Governance**: While elaborate multi-level governance structures are important, strong tensions and power conflicts can exist within these committees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.
*   **Coordinating Stakeholders**: [[challenges_in_coordinating_stakeholders_in_mission_oriented_policies | Coordinating stakeholders in mission-oriented policies]], especially across public and private sectors, is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The focus must be on fostering symbiotic and mutualistic partnerships, rather than parasitic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Positioning Missions**: Missions are too easily siloed within specific policy areas (e.g., environment or innovation) instead of being at the center of broader economic growth discussions, involving finance ministries as much as innovation ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.

### Implementation and Evaluation Challenges
*   **Risk Aversion in Public Sector**: Public agents, especially decision-makers and managers, often feel the weight of how they will be evaluated, discouraging risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. The public sector is traditionally seen as stabilizing, not risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.
*   **Outdated Evaluation Tools**: Existing evaluation techniques, like cost-benefit analysis and net present value, are insufficient for systemic, mission-oriented policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>. They don't capture dynamic spillovers or the learning from failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.
*   **Limited Reflectivity and Scale-Up**: There is limited reflection on pilot experiments, hindering the scale-up of mission-oriented approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. Many mission-oriented policies remain pilots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy and Administrative Instruments**: Changing policy often means fighting against established culture, processes, and bureaucratic instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>.
*   **Insufficient Public Sector Capabilities**: There has been a global outsourcing of public sector capabilities, which are crucial for delivering on missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

### Risk and Reward Sharing
*   **Sharing Rewards**: If risks are shared, so should be the rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. This requires rethinking intellectual property rights (IPR) and ensuring that public investment translates into public benefit, not just private profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.

## Approaches to Overcome Challenges
*   **New Narrative and Mindset**: Shift the narrative from public sector "de-risking" or "fixing markets" to "market shaping" and "co-creation," where the public sector is a value-creator and risk-sharer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. This requires changing the mindset of leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>.
*   **Systemic Approach**: Think about systems like places (e.g., a street, a school, a forest) rather than silos or sectors to force a systemic view and unlock broad value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.
*   **Bottom-Up Co-creation and Participation**: Involve diverse stakeholders, including citizens, from the start in defining and implementing missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. This includes engaging "experts in everyday life" who are trying to get things done on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>.
*   **Adaptive and Iterative Processes**: Mission design should be exploratory, not requiring all answers at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:40">[01:56:40]</a>. Learn and adapt along the way, building evidence through prototypes and experimentation to gain political capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[02:02:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:25">[02:22:25]</a>.
*   **Leverage Existing Investments**: Instead of seeking entirely new funding, aim to reorient existing budgets (e.g., for school food or street maintenance) towards mission-oriented outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:39">[01:20:39]</a>.
*   **Develop New Metrics**: Move beyond traditional evaluation methods to dynamic metrics that capture the full impact, including positive [[side_effects_and_unintended_innovations_from_mission_driven_projects | spillovers and unintended innovations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.
*   **Focus on Relationships**: Building trusted personal relationships, mutual understanding, and shared vision among diverse actors (public, private, third sector) is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. This includes listening to underrepresented voices to mitigate unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:29">[02:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>.
*   **Context-Aware Methodology**: Missions need a solid and contextually aware methodology to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>. This implies that tools and methods for implementation cannot be assumed to exist or be effective, and new ones may need to be designed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:37">[02:18:37]</a>.

### Examples of Addressing Challenges
*   **Sweden's Vinnova**: Instead of a top-down mandate, Vinnova started with open processes around mobility and food, engaging local actors and school kids to co-design solutions for streets and school food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:28">[01:16:28]</a>. This bottom-up approach and prototyping built political capital and allowed for rapid scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>.
*   **Spain's ENISA**: ENISA focused on industry and business perspectives, pushing for entrepreneurs and innovative SMEs, and adopted a "bottom-up discovery process" for mission definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a>. They aim to use the European Recovery Plan to reform administrative structures and rules to adapt to this new policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>.
*   **Netherlands' Health Holland**: This organization coordinates missions in health and care, involving a "quadruple helix" (researchers, entrepreneurs, government, and citizens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. They swap the traditional hierarchy, starting with initiatives that meet needs at the local level and then inviting ministries and other partners to witness these successes, fostering a mind shift towards collaborative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:49">[01:44:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>.
*   **UK's Engineering X**: This initiative of the Royal Academy of Engineering addresses global challenges by fostering engineering expertise and global networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>. Their mission design framework is helpful for navigating uncertainty and encouraging experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:29">[01:55:29]</a>. They prioritize building an inclusive community and listening to underrepresented voices to prevent unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:29">[02:03:29]</a>. They emphasize that not everyone needs to grasp the full terminology of missions initially; communication should focus on what's needed for specific stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:33">[02:07:33]</a>.

The overarching lesson is that [[integrating_missionoriented_approaches_in_government_and_policymaking | integrating mission-oriented approaches in government and policymaking]] is a "people strategy" that requires long-term engagement and commitment, rather than merely structural or organizational changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:41">[02:08:41]</a>.

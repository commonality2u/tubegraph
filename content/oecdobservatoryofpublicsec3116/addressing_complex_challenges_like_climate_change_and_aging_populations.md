Governments are compelled to innovate and adapt their approaches for several reasons, including the need to solve existing problems and to proactively address future complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Reasons for Government Innovation

Governments need to innovate to be more impactful and deliver new or better value for their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Beyond current issues, the evolving global landscape presents significant [[Challenges faced by governments that require innovation | challenges that require innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Adapting to a Changing World
Many governmental systems, such as healthcare, welfare, and taxation, were designed in eras like the 1950s and no longer align with contemporary society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Today's digital environment means citizens expect the same ease of experience when interacting with government services online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Therefore, governments must adapt to new systems, including digital technology, and [[Responding to changing societal needs | respond to the new needs]] that emerge from changing societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Preparing for Future Challenges
A critical aspect of governmental responsibility is to anticipate and [[Preparing governments for future challenges | prepare for fundamental changes and challenges]] that lie ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The world faces complex challenges and inherent uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Key examples of these include:
*   [[Challenges in addressing climate change | Climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Aging populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   The emergence of new types of societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

To address these, governments must [[adapting_science_and_technology_for_societal_challenges | anticipate the future]] and foster innovation, requiring a different kind of thinking today to be ready for tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

In summary, government innovation is essential for:
1.  Achieving more impactful solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
2.  Adapting to the changing environment around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
3.  Anticipating and preparing for future fundamental changes that will impact both government functions and societal living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

Administrative burdens refer to the negative experiences and frictions people encounter when interacting with government services and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. These burdens are categorized into three types of costs: learning, compliance, and psychological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Technology and digitalization play a crucial role in both alleviating and, if misused, exacerbating these burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

## Understanding Administrative Burdens

Administrative burdens manifest as various costs:
*   **Learning Costs:** The effort required to find and understand information about public services, their relevance, and eligibility requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. An example is navigating the complex choices within the US Medicare system for older adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Compliance Costs:** The resources (paperwork, time waiting, fees, documentation) spent fulfilling rules and requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The annual renewal process for Medicaid in the US, which can lead to procedural coverage loss, is a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Psychological Costs:** The stress, frustration, loss of autonomy, and even fear experienced during interactions with public processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. These costs are distinct from traditional notions of stigma and can significantly impact public trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Instances like a woman learning her child lost health insurance at a doctor's office due to form changes illustrate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Small administrative burdens can have significant impacts, as shown by experiments where simply pre-filling forms for student loan forgiveness vastly increased application rates from 24% to 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. These burdens also exacerbate inequality, as those most in need of help are often least equipped to navigate complex systems due to factors like language barriers, illness, cognitive disabilities, or lack of time and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## [[Role of Technology in Government Modernization | Technology]] and [[Digitalization of Government Services | Digitalization]] as Enablers for Burden Reduction

The most effective way to reduce burdens is through automated processes, shifting the responsibility from individuals to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. While nudges can help with learning costs, they are less effective when significant compliance and psychological costs are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

The [[Biden Administration Initiatives to Reduce Administrative Burdens | Biden Administration]] has taken steps to address administrative burdens, signing an executive order on customer experience in December 2021 that links burden reduction to improved customer experience and trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

Key strategies include:
*   **Introducing New Tools:** Integrating human-centered design into policy and process review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.
*   **Repurposing Existing Processes:** Requiring agencies to measure and report on customer experience and burden reduction in mandatory reports and budget preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. The Paperwork Reduction Act, traditionally focused on time spent filling forms, has been reinterpreted to also consider learning, compliance, and psychological costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

## Examples of [[Digital Transformation in Government | Digital Transformation in Government]] for Burden Reduction

### Automatic Renewal (Ex Parte) in Medicaid
The [[Biden Administration Initiatives to Reduce Administrative Burdens | Biden Administration]] has urged state governments to expand automatic renewal (known as "ex parte") for Medicaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. This means if a state has data confirming continued eligibility, they should automatically renew coverage without requiring new paperwork from individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. This initiative has significantly increased automatic renewals from approximately one in four to almost one in two nationally between 2023 and 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. This reduces lost time, burdens, and risk of coverage loss for millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

### State-Level Initiatives: Minnesota Medicaid and Code for America
In Minnesota, a project with Code for America (a non-profit Civic Tech firm) aimed to expand automatic renewal for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. Code for America used its technological skills to organize administrative data from various government sources, making it easy for caseworkers to determine eligibility for automatic re-enrollment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. This intervention nearly doubled automatic renewal rates for this vulnerable population, from around 40% to 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. Crucially, it also helped reduce inequalities, as non-white families, who previously had lower enrollment, saw their rates increase to average levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

### National-Level Intervention: US Digital Service
The US Digital Service (USDS), a civic tech organization working within government, sent experts to states to help improve Medicaid renewal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. These experts provided:
*   **Technical Capacity:** Identifying data sources for eligibility verification and reviewing state code for errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
*   **Policy Capacity:** Informing states about policy flexibility and ways to maximize opportunities for automatic renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.
This "tiger team" approach helped lower-performing states increase their automatic renewal rates to the national average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.

## Caveats and Challenges in [[Digital Transformation of Public Services | Digital Transformation of Public Services]]

While [[The Role of AI and Technology in Public Administration | technology]] is a powerful enabler, "blind faith" in it can lead to negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>.
*   **Misuse of Automation:** Automation, especially algorithms, can be misused. Examples from Australia and the Netherlands show how an disproportionate focus on fraud detection, using algorithms with high false positives and insufficient human oversight, led to negative outcomes and even government downfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. In these cases, burdens were shifted back to clients who had to prove their innocence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide:** Digitalization can increase inequality due to unequal access to digital tools and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. Older adults, for instance, often struggle with digital interfaces and have lower internet usage rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.
*   **Privacy Concerns:** The balance between increasing access through data sharing and ensuring privacy is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. While governments might overvalue privacy, citizens often prioritize ease of access, wondering why government doesn't use data they already have to simplify processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. A guiding principle for governments is a "do no harm" policy, sharing data in ways that benefit citizens rather than punish them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

## Key Lessons for Governments in [[Role of Digital Transformation in Public Administration | Digital Transformation in Public Administration]]

Based on current research and governmental efforts, key lessons for effectively reducing administrative burdens include:
*   **Cultivating a Public-Centric Culture:** Prioritizing the public's experience of administrative processes through tools like human-centered design and journey mapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.
*   **Building Capacity:** Agencies successful in burden reduction often have dedicated customer experience staff responsible for reviewing and revising processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
*   **Fostering Collaboration:** Redesigning processes often requires multiple agencies to work together, particularly concerning data sharing to verify eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Processes:** Governments are generally adept at adding new systems and rules but less so at reviewing their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. Continuous review is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.
*   **Strategic Use of Technology:** [[Role of digital advancements in public sector innovation | Technology]] is a powerful enabler, especially when it leverages administrative data to shift burdens from the public to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. However, blind faith in technology can lead to negative outcomes if biases are introduced or human oversight is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>. The goal should be to create an easy path for the majority while reallocating resources to assist those facing greater difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

The **Role of Media and Public Awareness in Tackling Gender-Based Violence** is crucial, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated the global challenge of gender-based violence (GBV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Often referred to as the "shadow pandemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, GBV is particularly difficult to address during lockdowns, as it is hard to know what happens within homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Victims may endure abuse due to fear of perpetrators, concern for family difficulties, or the mistaken belief that support services are closed or that their case is no longer a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### Informing the Public
Governments and related organizations must proactively inform the public that GBV remains a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This means going public and declaring that domestic, child, and sexual abuse will "never be accepted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. It is essential to communicate that places where victims can seek help are still open and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.

Switzerland's experience highlighted the importance of media engagement, with news outlets publishing articles and sending questions that helped reinforce the message that domestic violence remained a government priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Similarly, researchers conducted surveys and communicated results widely, contributing to shedding light on the "shadow pandemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Chile ensured that information about its GBV help channels was included in daily national TV reports on COVID-19 sanitary updates, elevating the issue to a [[importance_of_data_and_communication_in_public_health_strategies | public health issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. They also developed media campaigns to promote their channels and reinforce the message that preventing GBV is everyone's responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

### Ensuring Access and Reaching Vulnerable Groups
Public awareness campaigns must ensure accessibility for diverse populations. Switzerland launched a poster campaign in 13 languages and utilized a national website and social media campaigns to reach a broad audience, including about 1 million people through social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>. These campaigns emphasize a zero-tolerance policy against domestic violence and assure victims that help is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

Targeted messaging is crucial for groups at higher risk of GBV, such as women with disabilities or migrant women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. Chile identified specific high-risk groups and sent targeted messages, guidelines, and information through key actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. They also created new silent helplines like WhatsApp and online platforms, and partnered with pharmacies to disseminate information for women who may not have phone access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. Future plans include SMS messaging to hotlines to reach populations without smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.

### Whole-of-Society Approach
Tackling GBV requires a [[wholeofgovernment_approaches_to_addressing_genderbased_violence | whole-of-society approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This includes the fundamental [[the_role_of_civil_society_in_crisis_management | role of civil society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, private sector, and even banks in disseminating information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. Chile partnered with its state bank, Banco Estado, to make GBV information available in over 30,000 local banking shops across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. They also engaged business associations to make employers key actors in GBV prevention and detection, providing them with guidelines, protocols, and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

This broad engagement reinforces the message that preventing GBV is the responsibility of everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. Educational initiatives promoting "positive masculinity" and increasing awareness about different types of violence are also key components of a comprehensive societal response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.

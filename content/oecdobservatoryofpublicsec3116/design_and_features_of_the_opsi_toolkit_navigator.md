The [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] was developed by the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) as a public service project, supported by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The full OPSI team and numerous advisors contributed to its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Development and Purpose

In 2017, OPSI was tasked with building a toolkit for public sector innovation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. However, the initial thought was that the world did not need another toolkit, given that hundreds already existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The goal shifted from creating a new toolkit to helping people find the right existing toolkits based on their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

A workshop at the OPSI conference in 2017 engaged public sector leaders and civil servants to understand their "innovation journey" – how they found information, who they consulted, and what tools and methods they used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This user research informed the design of the [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | Toolkit Navigator]], aiming to provide "signal through the noise" of countless available toolkits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

This quote highlights a key finding: while many toolkits exist, users often prefer to build something new themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | Toolkit Navigator]] was designed to incentivize and facilitate this adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Guiding Principles: OPSI's Multifaceted Innovation Model

The design of the [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | Toolkit Navigator]] is underpinned by OPSI's multifaceted innovation model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This model categorizes innovation by its purpose:
*   **Directed/Shaping (Top-down)**: Mission-oriented innovation, like putting a person on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Undirected/Responding (Bottom-up)**: Innovation for innovation's sake, fostering entrepreneurial spirit to find new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented (High Certainty)**: Improving existing processes and services, such as using behavioral insights to increase tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Exploring (Uncertain Spaces)**: Radical shifts, looking at how internal and external factors change the nature of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Different innovation facets are supported by distinct methods and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The choice of methods biases innovation outcomes, making it crucial to select methods according to purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Findings from Toolkit Research

Extensive research into hundreds of existing toolkits revealed several issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>:
*   **Over-reliance on past tools**: Innovators often use methods that worked before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Misalignment**: Toolkits are chosen based on appeal or colleague use, not problem alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Skill incompatibility**: Some toolkits require advanced skills not always present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Granularity issues**: Toolkits can be too granular or too broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Learned helplessness**: Polished toolkits can discourage users from adapting them to their specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Ideal Toolkit Characteristics
Based on these findings, an ideal toolkit should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>:
*   **Adaptable and transferable**: Not necessarily directly transferable, but able to be modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Approachable and user-centered**: Obvious what to do with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Action-oriented**: Designed to lead to action, unlike guidance or knowledge bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Modular**: Allowing users to combine parts of different toolkits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Content Organization and Navigation

The [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | Toolkit Navigator]] organizes toolkits around "innovation tasks" or "jobs to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. While "problem-solving jobs" (e.g., discovery, prototyping) are typical, the navigator also includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>:
*   **Group behavioral jobs**: Building consensus, shared understanding, challenging assumptions, cultivating mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Approach planning jobs**: Preliminary scoping and getting started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Contextualization jobs**: Understanding dynamics of the working context, visualizing systems, imagining futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

The navigator differentiates between various levels of granularity, such as methodologies (abstract), methods, tactics, playbooks, guidance, tools, and techniques (specific) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This allows users to find content at the right level of abstraction for their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

## User-Centric Design and Implementation

The [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | Toolkit Navigator]]'s initial designs and prototypes were tested with public sector innovators and national government innovation leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Feedback from 349 pieces of input significantly shaped the final design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

### Emphasis on Adaptability and Openness
To foster innovative capacity, the navigator emphasizes building or adapting toolkits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. It prioritizes freely accessible toolkits (even those requiring email exchange) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
Toolkits are ranked and sorted based on their ease of adaptation, modification, and remixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This remixing builds capacity within teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

Toolkits are assigned badges based on their openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>:
*   **Open Source (Basic)**: Allows for reuse (downloading, printing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Open Source (Champion)**: Licensed with Creative Commons for remixing and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Heroes**: Provide editable files or code to facilitate remixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### Social Proof and Community Connection
Recognizing that trying new methods can be daunting, the navigator provides "social proof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Toolkits are linked to OPSI's case study platform, featuring hundreds of government innovation cases with demonstrated impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

The platform also connects to OPSI's user base of over 1,700 public sector innovators worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. This network allows users to discuss toolkits, provide reviews, and connect with peers for advice and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### Submitting New Toolkits
The [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | Toolkit Navigator]] encourages users to submit new toolkits through its forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. Submissions are reviewed before publication and must meet criteria such as being freely accessible, relevant to the public sector context, and stimulating action rather than just providing reports or research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

The [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] is an ongoing development, continuously being built out with user feedback and potential partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

## Introduction
Traditionally, [[public sector innovation | public sector innovation]] research has focused on government capacity to innovate within established territories and jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, in a world of continuous change where problems have evolved from complicated to complex, and from local to global, governments increasingly need to come together to find new solutions for shared issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The question then becomes how governments can innovate collectively for the common good and what factors contribute to successful [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Drivers for [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_sector_innovation | Crossborder Collaboration in Public Sector Innovation]]
The COVID-19 crisis highlighted several shortcomings and reinforced pre-existing vulnerabilities at both national and global levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Lack of Preparedness** Nationally, only half of OECD countries have dedicated institutions to identify novel, unforeseen, or complex crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Interconnectedness Vulnerabilities** Globally, the pandemic exposed how increased interconnectedness makes the world more vulnerable to common threats and highlighted weaknesses in international cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Transboundary Challenges** Major challenges like COVID-19, climate change, digitalization, and migration are not limited by jurisdictional borders, demanding collective action across countries and policy fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Demonstrating the ability to collectively tackle global challenges is essential to reinforce democracy and public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

While [[public sector innovation | innovation]] is a key tool, government efforts are largely confined to national or local borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Research and Partnerships
The OECD Observatory of [[public sector innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed Bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation partnered to determine which innovative practices can best support [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Their joint work over the last year included:
*   Extensive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   A global call for innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   Facilitating open workshops on [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>

This collaboration led to the launch of the first of a series of three reports on "Governing Cross-Border Challenges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The report highlights that increasingly complex and transboundary issues require existing governance mechanisms to adjust and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Key Themes in Cross-Border Governance Structures
The first report on "Governing Cross-Border Challenges" identifies three main themes for innovative governance mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>:

1.  **Building Cross-Border Governance Bodies**
    *   Focuses on creating new formal, "top-down" or "center-out" structures to bring together actors divided by existing borders in a structured way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
    *   **Case Study:** The Quark Council (Cavarkin Council), the first legal Nordic cross-border entity, uses cross-sector collaborative methods to drive future-oriented opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This entity has fostered over 100 projects over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. Its formalized structure has made it easier to find financing and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. The EU membership since 1995 has also facilitated collaboration and funding for Sweden and Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

2.  **Innovative Networks Tackling [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | Cross-Border Collaboration]]**
    *   Explores horizontal linkages and more informal approaches nurtured or participated in by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Governments can cede some control and act as one player among many through global networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Case Study:** The Open European Dialogue, a network of parliamentarians across Europe, allows members from different countries and opposing parties to collaborate through experimental dialogue methods, fostering shared learning in a neutral space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

3.  **Exploring Emerging Governance System Dynamics**
    *   Examines how [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | cross-border collaborations]] pioneer holistic new governance systems to foster new ways of working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This includes global governance mechanisms for co-financing, co-governance, co-project management, service design, and policy design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
    *   **Case Study:** The Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal in North England and South Scotland established a new governance system, securing nearly Â£500 million in co-funding for a unified approach to inclusive growth, bringing together small local jurisdictions for collective impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Challenges and Success Factors

### Challenges
*   **Culture and Language:** Understanding the culture and language of the other party is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. National stereotypes, even within a single country, can pose barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.
*   **"Not My KPI" Syndrome:** Public sector workers often feel that cross-border or cross-sectoral work is not part of their key performance indicators, making it difficult to gain support from superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. There can be a sense of "no permission to look across border" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
*   **Polarization:** Instruments of globalization (internet, free trade, technological advancements) that were expected to unite us, are now sometimes driving us apart through social media polarization and a focus on local news over international <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. The pendulum has swung from liberalization and cross-border cooperation back towards a focus on the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.
*   **Funding Metrics:** The way funding metrics work can be a barrier, as treasuries might "net off" benefits generated on both sides of a border, hindering co-investment for more efficient outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.
*   **National Level Resistance:** Regional cross-border initiatives can face resistance or lack of interest from national governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>.

### Success Factors & Recommendations
*   **Building Trust and Relationships:** A fundamental success factor is building trust and fostering strong, ongoing relationships among counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. It's often not about mistrust, but simply people not knowing each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. This "human contact" and "personal touch" are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>.
*   **Political and Senior Leadership Support:** Gaining political support and convincing senior agency leaders of the value of [[collaborative approaches in public sector innovation | collaboration]] is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
*   **Common Mission and Strategy:** Agreeing on a common mission, strategy, and structures is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Starting with a concrete or limited common problem can make cooperation easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
*   **Right Enablers:** Putting in place the right enablers and dynamics, such as co-funding models and co-governance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   **Sharing Costs and Benefits:** Expect a give-and-take in sharing costs and benefits, with the goal being a net benefit for all players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   **Engaging Local Communities:** The people living and working at the border often already know the solutions or have tried various approaches. Engaging them directly provides a rich vein of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
*   **Dialogue with Diverse Actors:** Beyond governments and international organizations, companies and NGOs possess critical information on impacts and needs, requiring a "cross-colonization of this information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>.
*   **Readiness to Change:** Individuals and institutions must be ready to change how things are done, accepting the transaction costs of learning new ways of working with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

## Skills for Public Servants
Investing in public servants' ability to develop and run [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | cross-border collaboration]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.
*   **Exposure:** Bringing public servants to the border areas to sit with communities helps them recognize and understand the problems directly, providing a safe space to practice problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>.
*   **Learning International Work:** Cross-border cooperation is a learned skill, not an inherent one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. Allowing people to gain skills in working internationally and across borders is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.
*   **Identity and Discourse:** Cross-border cooperation is also a question of identity. A lack of foreign correspondents and the influence of algorithms feeding siloed information hinder a broad public discourse on cross-border issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.
*   **Carrots and Sticks:** Building capacity requires both incentives (carrots) and mandatory requirements (sticks) for cooperation to be ingrained in law or international standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.

## Facing Uncertainty
Uncertainty is an inherent part of the global landscape, and we must learn to live with it rather than expect a utopia of smooth sailing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>. Instead of turning inward during uncertain times, the solution lies in [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how diverse cross-border playersâstates, regions, international organizations, private sector, scientists, transport, procurement, trade finance, NGOsâwere involved in addressing the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>. [[Public sector innovation and collaboration | Collaboration and public sector partnerships]] allow for learning from others, sharing risk, and pooling resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>. Effective states, democratic processes, and strong institutions lead to better results, even amid uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>.

## Personal Commitments for the Future
*   **Ask the Border Question:** Consistently encourage people within government agencies to ask the "border question" as part of their work, recognizing the gains for the entire jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.
*   **Deeper Cooperation:** Work to find new areas of [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | cross-border cooperation]] and exchange best practices to create optimal conditions for regional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>.
*   **Always Listen:** Prioritize listening as the first step to learning and opening doors for [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaboration and innovation in public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>.
*   **Educate on Transnational Governance:** Continue teaching about the virtues of transnational cooperation and governance to future generations of public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

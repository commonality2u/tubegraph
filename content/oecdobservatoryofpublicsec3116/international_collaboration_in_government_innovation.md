The OECD actively partners with countries and organizations to drive this work forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

### Brazil and Portugal
Brazil and Portugal are co-chairing a working group on [[innovation_in_government | innovation in public services]] that includes 22 countries plus the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. This group aims to build a framework for [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] in public administration, offering accessible methodologies, methods, and practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### European Union
The European Union actively promotes [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] among its 27 member states to enhance competitiveness, simplify procedures, reduce administrative burdens, and create more user-centric public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Key initiatives include:
*   **Once-Only Principle:** Implementing this principle ensures that businesses and individuals are asked for information only once, with administrations handling data exchange internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Portugal's IP (interoperability platform for public administration services) also supports this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
*   **Interoperability:** Achieving full interoperability between public administrations, both within and across countries, requires harmonized standards and machine-readable data that is semantically and legally compatible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Public Administration:** Prioritizing data-driven approaches allows governments to work with data rather than documents, enabling seamless data flow across administrative layers and countries, optimizing operations, and fostering [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   **Life Event Studies:** The EU conducts studies focusing on key administrative processes (e.g., identity card applications, business registration) to identify bottlenecks and promote [[innovation_in_government | innovative]] reforms that enhance efficiency and effectiveness across all member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.
*   **Latvia Innovation Lab:** The European Commission supported the creation of an [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] lab in Latvia's state general administration through its technical support instrument, bringing together multiple policy labs and consolidating working methods. Financial support was also provided from the recovery and resilience program to sustain the lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. This lab has demonstrated its importance through 14 [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] sprints, co-creating solutions for tax reforms, health emergencies, and support for crime victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.

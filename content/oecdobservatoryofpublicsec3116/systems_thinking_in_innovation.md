## Introduction to Systems Thinking in Innovation

The concept of [[systems_thinking_and_anticipatory_innovation_governance | systems thinking]] in innovation is gaining traction due to findings that policy and innovation projects in governments often employ a "layered approach" rather than a systematic one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. This means different initiatives are stacked without necessarily looking at their collective outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. The goal is to move towards a more effective and [[collective_system_change_through_innovation | systemic way]] to manage innovation portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

### Why Systems Thinking is Needed
Innovation activities, whether in the public sector or society, exist in parallel or synergy, but it's often difficult to see how they interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Public sector innovation aims to improve services, capture emerging possibilities, solve problems, and respond to environmental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. These diverse calls inherently form an innovation portfolio, whether intentional or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Without a systemic view, it becomes challenging to manage the various types of innovation—mission-oriented, enhancement-oriented, adaptive, and anticipatory—effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## Core Components of Systemic Innovation Portfolio Management
Initial analysis reveals several components for effective portfolio management, including:
*   Sense-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>
*   Stewardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>
*   Supportive structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>
*   Defining different purposes for portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>
*   Finding synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>
*   Resourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>
*   Monitoring and evaluating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>
*   Learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>
*   Communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>

However, many existing approaches primarily focus on initial sense-making and stewardship, with less attention paid to supporting structures or ongoing evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. A comprehensive portfolio management approach should encompass all these elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

## Implementing Systems Thinking in Practice

### Organizational Level Application
The OECD is developing an innovation portfolio assessment tool specifically for public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This tool aims to help organizations understand their current innovation portfolio, identify how organizational structures influence innovation, and foster more [[collective_system_change_through_innovation | systemic discussion]] around public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. Modules of this tool include:
1.  **Experience-based module:** Generating heat maps to show how organizational structures (e.g., tools, methods, culture, leadership, procurement) shape different types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.
2.  **Project-based assessment:** Analyzing how different innovation projects fit together, which purposes they serve, and their joint effects towards organizational goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. This aims to overcome the issue of projects being layered without consideration of their common outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.
3.  **Full organizational analysis:** A deep dive into how individuals perceive and interact with the innovation portfolio, and how their roles influence these perceptions, providing a complete picture of the organization's innovation goals and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>.

### Addressing Societal Challenges through Systemic Missions
Organizations like Vinnova (Swedish government innovation agency) are using [[systems thinking and transformative change | systems thinking]] to align top-down and bottom-up activities, cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral, and multi-level relationships to address missions with clear societal outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>. For example, instead of focusing on AI as a mission, they focus on societal outcomes like "healthy sustainable food" where AI could be an enabler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:22]</a>.

This approach involves:
*   **Co-designing with diverse actors:** Engaging stakeholders from various sectors (public transport, startups, corporations, government agencies) to build "systems canvases" that reveal complex interdependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>.
*   **Deconstructing systems:** Breaking down complex areas like food systems into key work areas (e.g., zero waste, circular systems, trusted produce) to identify starting points for a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:20:00">[25:20:00]</a>.
*   **Considering demand and supply sides:** Ensuring that innovation efforts encompass both technological advancements (supply-side) and citizen engagement, cultural adaptation, and place-based understanding (demand-side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:42:00">[25:42:00]</a>.
*   **Developing systemic layers:** Identifying specific, local interventions (e.g., demonstrator places) and understanding underlying common systemic layers that can scale across a country or system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>. This is akin to how smartphones allow diversity (apps) on consistent underlying stacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>.
*   **Rethinking traditional ownership:** For example, seeing a "street" not just as a traffic department's domain but as a complex system managed by a portfolio of actors (citizens, car companies, designers, school kids) to achieve multiple outcomes (e.g., decreasing domestic violence by introducing greenery) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:00">[28:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>.

### Managing Innovation in Complex Environments
For organizations like Climate-KIC, operating in the highly complex and uncertain challenge of climate change, [[managing_innovation_in_complex_environments | a portfolio approach]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:00">[38:05:00]</a>. Incremental change is insufficient for the necessary "step change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:00">[37:53:00]</a>. Their approach emphasizes:
*   **Transformative and demand-driven focus:** Moving from grant-funding single-point innovations to being deliberately transformative and responsive to market challenges and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:28:00">[38:28:00]</a>.
*   **Agility and learning loops:** The portfolio approach allows for rapid adaptation, creating learning loops to understand what works and where to direct resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>.
*   **Deliberate composition:** Making choices about work based on the sum of the whole, including interactions, complementarity, and outliers within a broader portfolio, rather than project-by-project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:00">[40:01:00]</a>.
*   **Sense-making:** Continuously understanding what is being learned from external activities to inform next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:57:00">[40:57:00]</a>.
*   **Navigating uncertainty:** Providing a spread of options to respond to challenges with high levels of uncertainty, acknowledging that all information will never be available for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:38:00">[41:38:00]</a>.
*   **Diversity of innovation:** Beyond technology, including innovations in business models, citizen engagement, policy, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:00">[42:42:00]</a>.
*   **Collective intelligence:** Utilizing a wide range of colleagues with diverse expertise and perspectives in decision-making to overcome inherent biases and harness broader insights, particularly for complex systems with multiple markets, systems, and supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:07:00">[44:07:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond "good projects":** An individual project, even if excellently structured, may not be chosen if it doesn't sufficiently answer portfolio-level questions about fit, complementarity, or gap-filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:55:00">[46:55:00]</a>.

## The Role of Systems Thinking in Societal Transformation
The global situation demands [[collective_system_change_through_innovation | systems change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:33:00">[52:33:00]</a>. Traditional management approaches are insufficient for "wicked problems" that involve multiple stakeholders, constant change, and multiple scales and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:45:00">[52:45:00]</a>.

Innovation portfolio management shifts the focus from organization-centric, team-based approaches to fostering transformation in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:37:00">[53:37:00]</a>. Key differences from traditional strategic portfolio management include:
*   **Problem-solution relationship:** Moving from clearly defined problems and solutions to needing an ecosystem to experiment and explore different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:08:00">[54:08:00]</a>.
*   **Projects as experiments:** Projects are seen as experimental means of learning about and tackling problems, rather than flat execution means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:25:00">[54:25:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term time span:** Framing portfolios from a transformation perspective requires thinking about the time span needed to achieve the transformation, informing project budgets and planning cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:50:00">[54:50:00]</a>.

Building capabilities for innovation portfolio management involves integrating:
*   **Sense-making and intelligence practices:** Learning and adapting across multiple projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:30:00">[55:30:00]</a>.
*   **Portfolio composition:** Selecting projects that have synergies for greater impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:41:00">[55:41:00]</a>.
*   **Impact design and visualization:** Designing the impact of the portfolio and using visualization techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:58:00">[55:58:00]</a>.

Organizations embedding this approach often focus on creating "social practices" around enabling change and transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:20">[1:10:20]</a>. This requires a shift in thinking about organizations as static entities to dynamic "organizing," which involves creating spaces for constant learning and adaptation based on experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:00">[1:17:00]</a>. Projects themselves can sketch out what the future organization should be, rather than starting with a rigid pre-defined structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:18:07">[1:18:07]</a>.

### Leadership for Systems Change
For [[collective_system_change_through_innovation | systems change]] and portfolio visualization, a new type of leadership is required. It's not about being dependent on a single "hero leader" but building processes that enable transformation regardless of individual leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:28">[1:19:28]</a>. This emerging "[[system_thinking_and_transformative_change | systems leadership]]" enables collaborative efforts where different people within the system take the lead on various issues, helping the whole system achieve outcomes beyond what a single organization or project could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:20:12">[1:20:12]</a>.

This also means leaders must:
*   **Let go of control:** Release the expectation of knowing all the answers or being the sole source of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:01">[1:21:01]</a>.
*   **Embrace diversity:** Give space for diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:32">[1:21:32]</a>.
*   **Tolerate uncertainty:** Be comfortable with not having all the information and operating in uncomfortable, uncertain situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:44">[1:21:44]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[Innovation as a response to societal challenges | Innovation portfolios and systemic solutions]] are a developing field. There is a need for continuous learning and sharing of insights as organizations worldwide navigate how to manage diverse innovation efforts effectively, move beyond single-point interventions, and foster concerted efforts towards their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:22:42">[1:22:42]</a>. This approach is particularly critical for bouncing forward from crises and building resilient public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:26:07">[1:26:07]</a>.

The themes of [[leadership_and_collaboration_in_public_service | leadership]], teamwork, and [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_leadership | innovation]] are central to shaping a future-fit [[future_challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_administration | public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. An international conference, co-hosted by the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU, the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, and the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA), explored opportunities for [[public_governance_possibilities | public governance]] as the world recovers from crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Discussions highlighted how adaptation, strategic foresight, and co-creation can lead to a better future for governments, societies, and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Importance of Teamwork: Lessons from Sport

Petra Majdič, a former cross-country skiing champion and Olympic medalist, shared her experiences, emphasizing the critical role of teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Despite cross-country skiing being an individual sport, she always spoke about "we and us" rather than "me and I" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Building a Dependable Team
Majdič stated she never felt like a leader, but rather "one of them" and "part of her team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Her focus was on building a dependable team where members could trust, believe in, and rely on each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This approach was rewarded in Vancouver when, despite breaking five ribs during warm-up, her team kept her warm, tested skis, and motivated her to believe she could still win a medal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
> "I could not have succeed if it wouldn't be for them. So that was my main or the most important message which I learned that the team is really the most important."

This emphasis on the team was also a vital message for the entire nation of Slovenia, which rallied behind her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## [[innovative_public_administration_practices | Innovation]] and Adaptation in [[Public Administration]]
The conference highlighted [[innovative_public_administration_practices | innovation]] and adaptation as key components for the [[future_challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_administration | public sector]].

### Daring to Be Different
Majdič, coming from a small country with limited financial resources for athletes, was "forced to find [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_leadership | innovative ways]]" to achieve similar training conditions as larger nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. An example of her [[innovative_public_administration_practices | innovative approach]] was changing the traditional racing suit colors (blue, red, black, white) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This made her highly visible, thrilled sponsors, and attracted new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. No one copied her suit, leading her to realize that "dare to be different is not a handicap, but it's an opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### The Need for Flexibility and Resilience
Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša underscored the importance of preparedness and flexibility in facing [[future_challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_administration | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. He noted that many countries, including Slovenia, were not prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic despite prior warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. The initial response from the European level was disorganized, but subsequent phases of coordination for recovery and vaccine development became a "success story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

Janša questioned how democracies can be more resilient to such [[challenges_in_public_administration_and_systemic_reform | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. He highlighted digital transformation as a key helper, suggesting that having all data online within the EU or OECD could significantly improve response times and targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>
> "I think that everything what has happened during this pandemic should be some call to to to awareness. It should be a call to be much more prepared for such situations, to be a call to to take those warning signals very seriously."

## Empowering People and Fostering a Learning Mindset
Marco Ongaro, Director General of EIPA, stressed that "people" are the key actors in driving change, reorganization, and [[innovative_public_administration_practices | innovation]] within both citizen groups and [[public_administration_practices | public administrations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

### Shifting Mindsets
Ongaro referenced a medical professional's experience during COVID-19, where traditional knowledge was insufficient, requiring a complete "re-think differently" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. He believes this "mindset ability" is crucial for tackling future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

### Cultivating Inclusion
[[Citizen participation in public administration | Inclusion]] is an important element, as the pandemic revealed the importance of "invisible" professions like nurses, supermarket clerks, and truck drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. Their voices should be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Ongaro advocates for bringing more diverse people into public administration by re-evaluating recruitment and promotion methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>. He suggests lowering barriers between the private and public sectors to foster mutual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

### Lifelong Learning and Digital Transformation
Ongaro emphasized the accelerating need for education and training as the world changes rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. He advocates for `[[behavioral_insights_in_public_administration | lifelong learning]]` where individuals are retrained multiple times throughout their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. While digital transformation is a significant enabler, Ongaro cautions that technology alone is not enough; people must be willing to use it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.

## [[Challenges and opportunities in public administration | Challenges]] and Outlook for Governments
The panelists discussed the `[[building_trust_through_effective_public_administration | public's confidence]]` in governments' ability to face complex `[[future_challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_administration | challenges]]`.

### Trust in Science and Global Cooperation
Prime Minister Janša expressed concern about the clear division in Europe regarding trust in science, particularly between Western Europe and Central/Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. This lack of trust is a significant problem when making decisions to tackle issues like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>.

Addressing global `[[challenges_in_public_administration_and_systemic_reform | challenges]]` like climate change requires action at the global level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. The European Union is trying to lead with ambitious goals, such as becoming CO2 neutral by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>. However, Janša stressed that a fundamental solution for climate change is `[[innovative_public_administration_practices | innovation]]` in producing clean energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

### Optimism and Preparedness
OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann acknowledged that governments were "seriously challenged" by the pandemic but responded "boldly and decisively," supporting businesses and households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. He highlighted the economic recovery underway, noting consistently upgraded GDP projections since mid-2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The recovery remains uneven, with new virus outbreaks being the biggest risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>.

Despite a mixed public opinion on government confidence, both Janša and Ongaro expressed optimism. Janša believes lessons have been learned, predicting faster, more efficient, and coordinated responses to similar future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. Ongaro noted that crises lead to learning, and mistakes made early in the pandemic are no longer being repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.

## Moving Forward: Key Principles
The consensus among experts is that future `[[leadership_and_collaboration_in_public_service | public service]]` must focus on:
*   **Preparedness:** Anticipating and planning for future `[[future_challenges and opportunities in public administration | challenges]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>.
*   **[[innovative_public_administration_practices | Innovation]]-Friendly Societies:** Creating environments that foster innovation, particularly in critical areas like clean energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>.
*   **Information Literacy:** Teaching citizens how to use, prioritize, and judge information effectively, addressing the challenge of low trust in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:22:17]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Cooperation:** Improving `[[leadership_and_collaboration_in_public_service | cooperation]]` and knowledge sharing among countries, breaking down bureaucratic barriers to `[[leadership_and_collaboration_in_public_service | collaboration]]` and learning from each other's good practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:36">[01:16:36]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>
> "One of the key elements in facing the future challenges is better cooperation between in our case European Union countries. So what we are really committed to do is changing the way we advise, the way we train, the way we help our member states in facing the challenges for the future."

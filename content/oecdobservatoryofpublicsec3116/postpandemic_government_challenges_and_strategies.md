The [[role_of_government_after_covid19 | Role of Government after COVID19]] and its approach to future outcomes are central to discussions following the COVID-19 pandemic, which has highlighted the inherent uncertainty of global environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This panel explores the implications of the crisis for governments and the future of governance beyond it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Illusion of Stability and Emerging Challenges
Traditionally, 20th-century governments were designed for predictable environments with established routines and available knowledge bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, the COVID-19 pandemic revealed this stability to be fictional, reminding us that the future is highly uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Governments cannot afford inaction, as the cost of late action or inaction can be severely high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Systemic Vulnerabilities and Hard Deadlines
The pandemic has underscored that contemporary challenges are global, complex, and deeply systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Serious vulnerabilities exist across global value chains, resource management (food, biodiversity), and even planetary resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. There are "hard deadlines" set by planetary boundaries, which are indifferent to risk appetite or willingness to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The biggest risk is "doing too little too late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### The Myth of "Normal" and Continuous Fluidity
The pandemic has shown that the idea of "normal" is a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Instead of moving from one stable equilibrium to another, we are likely entering a "never normal" situation of continuous fluidity, flux, and turbulence, requiring constant adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The metaphor of "war" against the virus is imperfect, as there is no clear enemy or finite end point; rather, the virus is part of a complex, adaptive ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Interdependencies and the Most Vulnerable
The crisis has highlighted both biological interdependence and, more importantly, moral interdependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Individualistic tendencies have proven problematic, and there's a need for a stronger sense of moral connections, especially as the crisis disproportionately affects the weakest and most vulnerable in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Policies must consider the varied and unequal impacts across different communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>.

### Competing Worldviews
The pandemic has exposed two competing worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>:
1.  **Control-based:** Governments believed they had control, possessed the "right answers," and could plan and budget to reach specific targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This thinking, though sounding funny today, is still embedded in our culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
2.  **Uncertainty-facing:** Acknowledging that right answers are unknown and constant learning is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. The speed of emergent learning is crucial, as "best practice" constantly changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

## Strategies for Future Governance
Governments must embrace uncertainty and adopt new ways of operating to thrive in a world where crises like COVID-19 may become endemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.

### Prepare, Don't Just React
A key motto is to "prepare, not react" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Instead of predicting the future, governments should use ideas about various future scenarios to make better decisions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This means questioning assumptions and mental models, even if the imagined future is "unpalatable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

### Shifting from Performance to Capacity Management
There's a critical need to shift from performance management to capacity management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This involves:
*   **Resilience Mindset:** Moving from optimization to building ramp-up or spillover capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
*   **Qualitative over Quantitative:** Valuing ethnographic stories and qualitative data alongside quantitative indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **Outcomes over Outputs:** Focusing on broader outcomes rather than narrow outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
*   **Exponential thinking:** Recognizing that small inputs can have profound non-linear effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **Growth Mindsets:** Moving from scarcity to abundance, and fixed to growth mindsets, believing systems can improve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
*   **Iterative Work:** Embracing continuous adjustment, experimentation, and sustained improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   **Integration over Silos:** Prioritizing integrated approaches, allowing local sub-optimization if it benefits the global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

### Embracing "Anticipatory Governance" and Learning
Governments need to integrate future-oriented thinking, or "anticipatory governance," into their main processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. This requires:
*   **Experimentation:** Act, probe, and learn from what happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. Leaders must celebrate learning, even from negative results, as learning is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.
*   **Building Relationships:** Focus on relationships between different actors â€“ "whole of government" and "whole of nation" approaches, fostering trust through credibility, reliability, and intimacy (understanding others' viewpoints) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Stewardship:** Governments must move beyond being just regulators or providers of order to become ecosystem stewards, facilitating multiple interests, convening different parties, and becoming platforms themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Shared Missions and Visions:** Having shared visions and ideas for the future, without being prescriptive on how to get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.
*   **Investing in Capabilities:** [[innovative_responses_to_covid19_by_governments | Innovative responses to Covid19 by governments]] are seen in efforts to prepare rather than react, using scenario planning tools, adopting a whole-of-government approach requiring leadership to shift culture, behavior, and work practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This includes investing in research, innovation, and digital infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Regenerative Investments:** When taking financial risks, governments should ensure investments promote a regenerative approach, shaping the future rather than just reacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. This includes rewarding those moving towards desired directions and considering value sharing for high-risk, high-reward efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

## Leadership in Uncertainty
Leaders in government must possess the ability to "hold opposing thoughts in their head and continue to function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. This means balancing present needs with future considerations, micro-level impacts with macro-system stewardship, and knowing when to slow down or speed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>.

## Engaging Citizens and Building Trust
Citizens can trust government experiments and uncertain futures if they are involved in the co-creation of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. People buy into what they help create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. This calls for participatory government, bringing different interests together to deliberate and synthesize ideas, finding solutions where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

Cities play a crucial role in this co-creation, as many transformations, such as food or mobility systems, converge in urban environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. Connecting local, national, and international efforts is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>. Citizens, particularly the most vulnerable, should have a voice in addressing complex issues like climate change or inequality, recognizing that behavioral change comes not just from authority or rational persuasion, but from experience-based learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.

## Conclusion
The [[impact_of_pandemic_on_government_practice | Impact of pandemic on government practice]] requires governments to embrace a new role defined by learning, quality relationships, and a sense of urgency for transformative actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This shift towards [[postcrisis_strategies_and_future_preparedness | Postcrisis strategies and future preparedness]] and [[preparing_governments_for_future_challenges | Preparing governments for future challenges]] is essential for navigating the "never normal" future.

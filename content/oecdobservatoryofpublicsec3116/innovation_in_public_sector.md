[[public_sector_innovation_introduction | Innovation in the public sector]] is a critical area for governments worldwide, aiming to bridge the gap between good intentions and practical implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The OECD Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] and the associated [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] Playbook are key tools designed to support this advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The OECD Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]]
The OECD Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]], created over five years ago, is a high-level instrument providing guidance to governments on how to steer and promote [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. As of its discussion, 43 countries had already adhered to the Declaration, indicating its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. For Chile, signing the Declaration in 2019 demonstrated its commitment to the [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] agenda and provided a common understanding of [[public_sector_innovation | public innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. For Romania, joining the Declaration was new and crucial for introducing the concept of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

### Five Principles of the Declaration
The Declaration is built upon five core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>:
1.  **Embrace and champion [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] within the public sector:** This involves providing high-level sponsorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. In Sweden, the Ministry's signing of the Declaration provides legitimacy and mandate for complex [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] work in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
2.  **Encourage and equip all public servants to innovate:** This ensures that skills and incentives are in place for all public servants to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
3.  **Cultivate new partnerships and involve diverse voices:** It is important to go beyond government walls and rely on the wisdom and motivation of ecosystem stakeholders, ensuring everyone has a say in how [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is created, implemented, and iterated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
4.  **Support exploration, iteration, and testing:** This involves testing before implementing, learning from errors, and managing risks in controlled environments using robust methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
5.  **Diffuse lessons and share practices:** The Declaration emphasizes that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] cannot be a monopoly; it must be shareable and built in partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Sharing experiences helps others learn and improve their activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

> [!info] Integrated Vision
> The Declaration offers an integrated vision of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], encompassing projects, skills, and sponsorship in a holistic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## The [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] Playbook
The [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] Playbook is a tool developed to translate the OECD Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It was co-created by diverse countries to help apply the Declaration in distinct contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Application Examples
The Playbook has been applied in various ways across different countries:
*   **Sweden:** Was the first country to translate the Playbook into a different language (Swedish) and developed in-person workshop materials, simplifying extensive content for their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. This work was based on prototyping with a Swedish target group, including the city of Uppsala, which showed the need for localized material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
*   **Romania:** Translated the Playbook and used it as a critical tool to build an emerging community of [[public_sector_innovation | innovators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. They conducted a massive virtual session with 800 people, demonstrating the tool's reach beyond [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. The Playbook is being used to structure objectives for their [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] strategy and action plan, and they plan to integrate the digital Playbook into a new platform for interactions between public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Chile:** The Laboratorio de Gobierno (government lab) uses the Declaration as a guideline for its services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. Their agile consultancy service co-creates solutions based on exploration, iteration, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. They also foster new partnerships and involve different voices in every project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. Chile has a [[public_sector_innovation | public innovators]] network with over 28,000 members from various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. They have a strong focus on [[innovation_skills_for_public_sector | skills development]], having launched a virtual [[public_sector_innovation | Public Innovation]] school with over 50 structured videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

## Public Innovation Index (Chile)
Chile's Public Innovation Index is a tool created in 2019 with the Inter-American Development Bank to measure the [[public_sector_innovation | capabilities]] of public services, primarily in Chile's central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. It assesses 50 services using a framework of 10 capabilities, including structure, legal framework, skills, digital capabilities, openness to users and other institutions, and established processes for [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. This evidence-based measurement helps identify maturity levels and provides tools to fill gaps in [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Chile is working to extend this index to other Latin American countries like Peru, Colombia, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from Co-creation
Working with other countries on the Playbook revealed shared challenges, making participants feel more comfortable and less isolated in their [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. The co-creation process itself was an experiment that fostered determination and resilience in explaining and disseminating [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] concepts and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. It highlighted that many countries face similar problems, especially regarding capacity building for [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], reinforcing the value of international cooperation to avoid "reinventing the wheel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

## Digital Version of the [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] Playbook
A new digital version of the [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] Playbook has been developed to be more interactive and dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This version addresses feedback to make the Playbook:
*   **Engaging, playful, and interactive** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>.
*   **Cross-linked:** Highlighting connections between available resources for a single point of access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>.
*   **Updatable and manageable:** To streamline the process of producing new versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
*   **Accessible and usable for all users, regardless of location:** Allowing anytime, any-moment access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   **Capable of automatic reporting:** To systematize and export results of user interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.

This new digital version was shaped by colleagues from Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Luxembourg, Spain, and Sweden who helped identify features, structure, and user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. The digital journey guides users through framing challenges, taking stock of their current situation (from red to green areas for improvement), and suggesting actions with estimated impact and complexity (e.g., "quick wins" or "strategic efforts") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. Users can download a summary report as a PDF, providing a roadmap for solving initial challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.

Two recent OECD reports, conducted in partnership with INAP (Brazil's National School for Public Administration), provide an overview of [[Innovation in the public sector | public sector innovation]] in Brazil, with one report specifically focusing on [[Innovation Skills for Public Sector | innovation skills and leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Context of the Reports

In 2015, INAP and the OECD signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) centered on [[Innovation in Public Sector | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This led to three reviews:
*   A digital government review in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   A review focused on [[Innovation Skills for Public Sector | innovation skills and leadership]] in the Brazilian public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   A review focused on the [[Innovation in public sector management | innovation system]] of the public service of Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

INAP's goal has been to update capacity building for 21st-century skills, promote training for civil servants, and understand the needs for capacity building and skills for senior executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The reports, initiated under one administration and concluded under another, benefited from an external vision, providing continuity to the agendas through political transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Why Focus on Leadership for [[Innovation in Public Sector | Public Sector Innovation]]?

[[Innovation in Public Sector | Innovation]] needs to be a core, routine activity for effective government, not just sporadic or reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Brazil faces complex challenges like inequality, financial constraints, corruption, and changing demographics, where [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] can be helpful, though not a "magic bullet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

A report on Brazil's civil service from around 2010 identified a rigid and difficult system that was not agile, structured through many different careers that often worked against collective interest, and lacked a clear vision for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. The concept of [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] serves as a rallying call to rethink the fundamental organization of civil services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. Senior civil servants, holding the highest positions (DAS five and six or FCPE equivalents in Brazil), are pivotal in implementing or enabling change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.

Addressing the `Role of leadership in public sector innovation` is crucial due to:
*   **Productivity and Efficiency:** Brazil's civil service is expensive compared to OECD averages (13% of GDP vs. 10%; almost 30% of public expenditure vs. 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. Effective leadership ensures this significant investment in people is managed well, allowing public servants to use and develop their talent to meet pressing needs, including [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. A productivity loss occurs if public servants are not optimally utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>.
*   **Public Trust:** There are profound `Challenges in Public Sector Innovation` regarding public trust in government in Brazil, and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>. Research links the effectiveness of senior civil servants to greater integrity in the public service, which in turn builds greater trust from citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.
*   **Supporting Innovation:** [[Role of leadership in public sector innovation | Leadership support]] is consistently identified as one of the most important factors for successful [[Innovation in Public Sector | public sector innovation]], while its absence is a major barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

## Key [[Innovation Skills for Public Sector | Innovation Skills]]

The report aimed to identify the skills and competencies needed among senior civil servants to grow and support [[Innovation in Public Sector | public sector innovation]] and become stewards of an [[Innovation in public sector management | innovation system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

### Six Core [[Innovation Skills for Public Sector | Skills Areas]]
The report outlines six core [[Innovation Skills for Public Sector | skills areas]] for [[Innovation in Public Sector | public sector innovation]], viewed as organizational needs that civil servants should be aware of and potentially specialize in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>:
*   **Curiosity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>
*   **Iteration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a> (low confidence around prototyping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>
*   **User-centricity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a> (low confidence around behavioral insights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>
*   Other skills areas with medium comfort levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.

A survey of nearly 3,000 Brazilian civil servants revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>:
*   A middle-level assessment of their own skills (yellow area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.
*   Significantly lower perceptions of their management's ability to support them (gray area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   Perceptions of their organization's readiness for these skills falling somewhere in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.

### Leadership Model for Public Sector Innovators
Workshops with Brazilian public sector innovators identified three main skill groups, founded on public service values and ethics, that describe a "dream public sector leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>:
*   **Business Skills:** Ability to align resources with needs and use various management tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.
*   **Innovation Skills:** Leaders don't need to be experts in all innovation tools (e.g., data science, iterative processes), but they must understand how these processes are supported, how to lead them, what questions to ask their civil servants, and how to create the necessary space for those using these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
*   **Mindsets:** This category, a major point of discussion, includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>:
    *   Empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>
    *   Empowerment (of civil servants, innovators, citizens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>
    *   Continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>
    *   Courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>
    *   Digital thinking (organizing services and concepts digitally) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>

## Senior Civil Service System: Supply and Demand

The report proposes a model for a senior civil service system that considers both supply and demand sides of leadership capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>:

### Building the Supply of Leaders
This involves ensuring the workforce has the right skills and can activate them for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>:
*   **Defining Skills:** Clearly define the required skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.
*   **Development Opportunities:** Provide opportunities to develop these skills for current and future leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.
*   **Workforce Mapping:** Map existing skills within the workforce to identify available expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.
*   **Learning Culture:** Create a learning culture for [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] to ensure skills are constantly learned and revised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.

### Creating the Demand for Leaders
This focuses on how leaders are sought and held accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>:
*   **Appointment Processes:** Use appointment processes that include transparent vetting of candidates against clear, innovation-related criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. If leaders are appointed based on criteria other than what is stated, it undermines the seriousness of the stated goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Support and Accountability:** Once leaders are in place, provide support through training and establish performance and accountability mechanisms that reinforce innovative leadership behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.

### [[Challenges and strategies in implementing public sector innovation | Challenges and Strategies]] in Brazil
While Brazil has made efforts to build the supply of leadership (e.g., various [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] training initiatives, often led by INAP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>, there's `Challenges in Public Sector Innovation` regarding the demand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. This is partly due to Brazil's political system, where appointments are often made at the will of the President and ministers, requiring political buy-in and a willingness from politicians to relinquish some power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>.

## Recommendations for Developing Leadership Skills

The recommendations are structured into immediate, second-stage, and longer-term categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.

### Building the Supply
*   **Unify and Network:**
    *   **Immediate:** INAP and others should develop a hub to connect people working in this space, map activities, and include sub-national levels and civil society actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
    *   **Second Stage:** Use this network to develop a more unified [[Role of leadership in public sector innovation | innovative leadership competency model]] through a collaborative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.
*   **Align Leadership Development Ecosystem:**
    *   **Immediate:** Create greater transparency in training offers to help civil servants find [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]]-oriented training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.
    *   **Second Stage:** Conduct a skills analysis and align various training programs with the innovation competency model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.

### Creating the Demand
*   **Develop Merit-Based Hiring:**
    *   **Immediate:** Better understand where merit-based practices are already used in the federal administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>. This government has already established some minimum criteria for DAS and FCPE positions, a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.
    *   **Second Stage:** INAP could undertake pilots to support merit-based hiring and recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.
    *   **Longer-term:** Scale up and embed these practices in legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>. This must be done carefully to avoid collapse and reinforcing negative narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.
*   **Integrate Innovation into Job Profiles and Assessments:**
    *   **Immediate:** Reflect [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] in job profiles of senior civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>. This is difficult to measure mechanically but is crucial because civil servants face personal risk when undertaking [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] without clear job descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.
    *   **Longer-term:** Hold leaders accountable for achieving better outcomes through innovation, providing performance incentives and a "cover" that their actions align with their job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.

## Next Steps and Future Challenges

The reports have already promoted some change in Brazil, particularly in the alignment of recruitment and selection with [[Innovation in public sector management | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:59">[01:08:59]</a>. Key future `Challenges in implementing innovation in the public sector` include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>:
*   Translating and disseminating the reports to a broader Brazilian audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.
*   Keeping the conversation going, creating networks, and engaging more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>.
*   Disseminating the results of pilot programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>.

### Role of Public Universities
Public universities play a crucial role in the [[Innovation in public sector management | innovation system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>. They can provide insight into identifying problems, generating new ideas (technology, policies, practices), and offering rigor to implementation studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.

More narrowly, universities create the pipeline for public sector civil servants and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. Stronger linkages between governments and universities are essential to target graduates, clarify opportunities in government, and ensure universities teach the right skills while presenting the public sector as a valuable career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. This connection is especially important for "policy innovation" (doing things differently in government) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>.

### Open Innovation
Open [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] can be a valuable tool, recognizing that solutions may come from outside government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>. It is particularly effective when the broad aim is clear and external solutions can be integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>. However, its value changes depending on the context and the type of [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] (e.g., less effective for exploratory or adaptive innovation where questions are less clear) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. Brazil is experimenting with open [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] through challenge platforms that allow public sector organizations to suggest challenges and offer awards for solutions, including prototypes and funding for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>.

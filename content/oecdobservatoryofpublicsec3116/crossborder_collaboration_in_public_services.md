[[Crossborder collaboration in public sector innovation | Crossborder collaboration]] in public services is an important discussion, with participants joining from various professions and backgrounds, including partners from Brazil, Canada, Portugal, and the European Commission [00:00:05]. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) strongly believes this agenda is central, especially in the current global context [00:02:05].

## Importance and Rationale
The nature of the European Union, for instance, necessitates active partnership among all member states [00:23:41]. There is significant interest from public administrations to work together and learn from each other [00:23:49]. Global challenges such as inequality, climate change, and digital transformation require global solutions, making platforms for sharing knowledge and best practices essential [00:41:10].

## Objectives of Public Service Innovation
Governments pursue various objectives through [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | public sector innovation]], many of which benefit from a [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_sector_innovation | crossborder collaboration]] approach:
*   Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public services [00:02:53].
*   Increasing public satisfaction [00:02:59].
*   Helping uptake of services, particularly for populations facing access challenges [00:03:05].
*   Ensuring fairness and equal treatment between governments and citizens [00:03:10].
*   Building trust between citizens and governments through quality services and inclusion [00:03:20].

## Key Areas for [[government_collaboration_across_borders | Government Collaboration Across Borders]]

### Data-Driven Public Administration
A strategic shift towards a data-driven approach is crucial [00:25:01]. This involves working with data rather than through documents, meaning data should flow seamlessly between administrative layers and across countries [00:25:09]. This requires high-quality, exchangeable data that is technically, legally, and semantically consistent [00:25:34]. Such an approach enables governments to optimize operations, anticipate and meet citizen needs, develop new services, and foster [[collaboration_and_innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] across borders [00:25:46].

### Interoperability and Standard Harmonization
Full interoperability between public administrations, including across countries, is necessary [00:23:15]. This requires harmonizing standards and ensuring data is machine-readable with both semantic and legal operability [00:23:20].

### The "Once-Only" Principle
Overcoming barriers in public service delivery requires implementing the "once-only" principle, where businesses and individuals are asked for information only once, and administrations handle data exchange internally [00:23:00]. This prevents citizens from repeatedly providing the same information across different systems [00:18:49].

### Simplifying Procedures and Reducing Administrative Burdens
[[Crossborder government innovation | Innovation]] aims to simplify procedures and reduce administrative burdens for companies and citizens [00:22:01]. For example, the European Commission aims for a 25% reduction in reporting obligations for companies, which could save up to 37 billion euros annually [00:22:19].

### Human-Centric Design
A more strategic and consistent approach to supporting innovation in public services focuses on putting the human element and people at the center [00:03:46]. This requires a cultural shift in bureaucracy to ensure citizens are central to services, especially during significant life events [00:04:00].
*   Brazil's National Digital Government Strategy focuses on digital transformation in all states and municipalities to ensure easy access to digital government services, developed collaboratively with public servants, experts, and users [00:08:00].
*   Portugal's national digital strategy aims for public services to proactively meet needs, enhancing efficiency and bureaucracy by always putting users at the center [00:14:43].

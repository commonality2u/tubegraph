The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for radical reforms in prevailing policy directions and [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | government approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. There is an emerging consensus that governments and their policies must systematically change, as the crisis has demonstrated the necessity for such shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Systemic Vulnerabilities and Calls for Change

The current crisis is viewed as a systemic shock revealing the growing inadequacy of existing worldviews that underpin governance systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>. It has not so much changed long-term trends but brutally accelerated them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>. Two main narratives have emerged: a desire to return to "normal" as soon as possible, and the view to "not waste a good crisis" by seizing the opportunity for a serious, sustainable transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.

The European Commission, for instance, has taken a clear stance to integrate its EU Green Deal with digital and green transitions, aiming to fast-forward towards a green, digital, and resilient future through its "Next Generation EU recovery package" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. This represents a significant window of opportunity to do things differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

### Challenges in Sustaining Innovation
The economic model and socio-economic policies need to be sustainable in the long term, moving beyond current bailouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. New needs and vulnerabilities have either become visible or been created by the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. There is a "push and pull" on whether to maintain current trajectories or seize the moment for fundamental change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:44">[01:47:44]</a>.

## Innovative Approaches in Action

Governments have shown a huge number of innovative responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>:
*   **Data and Digitalization** A fundamental increase in the use of real-time data and digitalization, leveraging existing technologies like drones and digital solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.
*   **New Ways of Working** Widespread adoption of teleworking and automation solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sector Collaboration** Governments are working across silos, with the private sector, and crowding in solutions and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>.
*   **Conditional Support** There's a trend towards conditional support, such as linking bailouts for industries (e.g., airlines) to sustainability goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>.
*   **Policy Redesign** Initial attempts at redesigning policies, including rethinking urban transportation and mobility, show that "we can actually do things in a different way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

### Global Examples:
*   **Vietnam** stands out with almost 100 million people, zero deaths, and only 350 cases, achieved through nimble, smart, and dynamic approaches like shifting procurement, and integrating culture and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. Countries that have previously dealt with SARS or other regular crises (like typhoons) appear to have exercised a "muscle" for effective [[public_sector_innovation_in_response_to_covid19 | crisis response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:15">[01:42:15]</a>.
*   **Finland** though performing well overall, exposed failures in its 2008 pandemic preparedness strategy, which hadn't been updated and contained expired strategic reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:41">[01:42:41]</a>. The failure of integrated working between four agencies at Helsinki Airport regarding quarantine measures also highlighted a lack of foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:48">[01:43:48]</a>.
*   **The Netherlands** has seen inspections and regulations more or less halted, yet society has not collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. This points to the potential of **co-production** between government and society, where society comes up with creative initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>.
    *   **France's building system** is an example where legal liability and mandatory insurance for builders mean insurance companies, not government, perform inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. This is seen as a more sensible and outcome-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.
    *   In the **Netherlands**, transporting dangerous goods shifted to a system where transporters have a legal liability of â‚¬10 million and must be insured. This led to a remarkable improvement in safety within one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. This approach requires governments to "step down" and trust societal actors and insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>.

## Tools and Principles for Systemic Transformation

To achieve systemic change, new tools and methods are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.
*   **Causal Layer Analysis** is a method well-suited to help governments navigate profound changes and adapt to emerging worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>.
*   The **EU Policy Lab's "Complex System Analyzer"** is a two-day workshop tool designed to help identify leverage points in complex systems and connect them to a future vision aligned with a more enduring worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[01:21:46]</a>. This tool is available as Creative Commons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:32">[01:22:32]</a>.
*   The **UK Policy Lab's "Government as a System" toolkit** helps demystify government's role in crises by categorizing actions from formal powers (legislate, fund) to softer powers (collaborate, enable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:12">[01:28:12]</a>. This toolkit has expanded to 56 actions, mapping local, regional, national, and international government actions to address bigger systemic challenges across jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.
*   **Strategic Management** views progression as a series of experiments, where small actions can collectively lead to paradigm shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:41">[01:31:41]</a>.
*   **Speculative Design** can be used to think about futures in new ways, expanding what is considered "possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.

### Cultivating Learning and Adaptation
To learn in real-time and improve responses for future waves, governments need to:
*   **Integrate Learning Teams** within the core of government and on the frontlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>.
*   **Leverage External Capacity** Systematize the integration of external offers of help and new capacities during calm periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Adaptive Mindsets** Understand that problems and solutions will emerge together, requiring constant adjustment based on new data sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:19">[01:34:19]</a>.
*   **Promote Collective Intelligence** Ensure diverse perspectives are at the table, with psychological safety for sharing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.
*   **Rethink Preparedness** Move away from linear, industrial thinking about preparedness (e.g., storing supplies) towards an adaptive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The ultimate measure of success for a second wave will be "who has learned the most" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>.
*   **Embrace a "Regenerative" Approach** Shift from a "doing things right" bureaucracy to a regenerative and restorative model focused on "doing the right things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>.
*   **Develop [[adapting_to_crisis_with_innovative_approaches | Exit Strategies]]** that are broad, socially engaged, and built on creative endeavors, rather than narrow interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:25">[01:50:25]</a>.
*   **Invest in Austerity Wisely** Rather than cutting to save, governments should cut to invest, using savings to build new capabilities and prepare for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:42">[01:50:42]</a>.
*   **Redefine the [[role_of_government_in_crisis_response | Role of Government]]** and trust society to find innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:35">[01:25:35]</a>.

The opportunity for change is "extraordinarily short," possibly a "100-day window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>, emphasizing the urgency to reform governments and rethink how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a>.

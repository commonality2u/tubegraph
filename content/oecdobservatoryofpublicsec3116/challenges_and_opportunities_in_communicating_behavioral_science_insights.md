The **OECD report, *Mind Shift Green Lift: Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy***, highlights the critical role of understanding human behavior in tackling climate challenges [00:00:05]. The green transition is not solely about technology or policies; it is fundamentally about how people live, work, and make decisions [00:00:35]. Therefore, progress in environmental policy cannot be achieved through technical solutions alone [00:00:48].

## The Human Element in Environmental Policy
[[Behavioral Science]] offers valuable insights into encouraging the necessary changes in human behavior for a green, low-carbon future [00:02:47]. By understanding and addressing the factors that shape people's decisions, governments can design more effective and lasting strategies [00:04:19].

## Key Areas of Focus for Behavioral Science
The report identifies several trends where [[Behavioral Science]] is increasingly leveraged for environmental policy, many of which directly relate to communication and engagement:

### Predicting Public Acceptability of Green Reforms
Governments are increasingly using [[Behavioral Science]] to anticipate and address public reactions to green policies [00:23:53]. Understanding how people perceive and respond to policies is crucial for their success [00:24:07]. By leveraging data, especially longitudinal data, governments can gauge citizens' climate awareness, support for reforms, preferences, and behaviors [00:24:12]. This enables the design of policies that are clearer, more accessible, and aligned with public values, ultimately building trust [00:24:26]. When policies and communications are transparently refined based on these insights, it boosts public engagement, encourages sustainable behaviors, and strengthens the impact of green reforms [00:24:34].

An example from the Netherlands showcases this trend, where the Behavioral Science team at the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy conducted extensive research to understand the behavioral drivers and barriers affecting Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in their investment in sustainability [00:25:01]. This research, including surveys, focus groups, interviews, and online experiments, revealed that while 64% of SMEs were inclined to be more sustainable, only 5-18% had taken feasible steps [00:25:40]. Identified motivators included high energy prices, cost savings, and legal compliance, while barriers included high perceived costs (time and money) and competing priorities [00:26:13]. These insights were instrumental in shaping policy approaches tailored to the behavioral realities of SMEs [00:26:48].

### Boosting Citizen Participation in Environmental Policies
Governments and civil society actors are actively seeking proactive and inclusive ways to engage citizens in shaping and implementing green policies [00:27:22]. [[Behavioral Science]] helps mobilize diverse groups and create more opportunities for public involvement in decision-making processes [00:27:32]. The OECD trust survey revealed a "trust gap," indicating that many citizens feel they lack meaningful chances to participate in policymaking [01:02:50], with less than four out of ten citizens in 30 OECD member countries trusting their government [00:10:38]. Bridging this gap is a key role for [[Behavioral Science]], helping to align policies with public expectations, foster trust, and make engagement and participation easier by removing barriers [00:28:00].

In Ireland, the National Dialogue on Climate Action, led by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, engages citizens directly in climate action [00:28:23]. Its goals include raising awareness, understanding, and engagement with climate change; motivating and enabling climate action; empowering citizens to adopt sustainable behaviors; and using findings to inform policy responses [00:28:45]. Since 2021, over 12,000 citizens have participated in annual climate conversations [00:29:07]. This program has led to the development of a key performance indicator (KPI) formed on a [[Behavioral Insights]] dashboard, allowing policymakers to integrate evidence from social and behavioral studies into policy design [00:29:39].

### Building Resilience to Climate Misinformation
Governments are also leveraging [[Behavioral Science]] to combat the spread of climate misinformation [00:33:49]. This involves understanding people's susceptibility to false information and the factors driving its spread, and then developing strategies to counter its impact and strengthen democratic resilience [00:34:05].

Canada's Parka initiative (Program of Applied Research on Climate Action) exemplifies this by conducting national surveys and in-depth studies to assess the Canadian public's susceptibility to climate-related misinformation [00:34:31]. The aim is to understand how people think, feel, and act when confronted with misinformation, and to identify the most harmful types [00:34:57]. In 2024, a randomized control trial tested behaviorally informed interventions to boost resilience to misinformation, focusing on encouraging individuals to assess information accuracy, strengthening digital literacy, and preemptively refuting common false claims [00:35:26]. Interventions enhancing digital media literacy and providing active preemptive refutations were most effective [00:36:02]. Interestingly, passive information about finding misinformation without critical thinking tools made people more skeptical and less accurate in identifying true headlines, suggesting unintended consequences [00:36:21].

## Moving from Insights to Action
To accelerate the green transition, the OECD encourages governments to [[Incorporating Behavioral Science in Government and Industry | strengthen decision-making within governments themselves]] by integrating [[Behavioral Science]] into policy processes to reduce biases and improve effectiveness [00:39:19].

### Caveats for Effective Communication
While powerful, [[Behavioral Science]] is not a "silver bullet" [00:40:15]. A holistic approach, including technology and systemic changes, is necessary for meaningful progress [00:40:28]. It is also crucial not to place the entire burden of responsibility solely on individuals; instead, the goal is to empower consumers, users, and citizens as active participants in the green transition [00:39:55]. "Demand-side policies" in this context extend beyond individual choices to include governments and industries, recognizing their power to drive systemic demand shifts, such as through procurement efforts [00:40:42]. Achieving real impact demands collaboration across all sectors [01:11:29].

Academics also emphasize the need for clear communication, especially when facing a "backlash against everything green" [00:51:30]. Effective strategies include:
*   **Showing good examples**: Highlighting successful applications of behavioral approaches that demonstrate tangible benefits in specific policy fields, regions, or countries [01:16:25].
*   **Focusing on low-risk, low-key solutions**: Offering interventions that are politically palatable, especially when climate topics are contested [01:17:45].
*   **Direct engagement with scientists**: Building trust through direct involvement of scientists in the policy process [01:00:58].
*   **Addressing the trust crisis**: Countering low trust in government and leaders by promoting transparency, participation, and deliberation [00:50:27].
*   **Counteracting misinformation**: Actively using behavioral approaches like "inoculation strategies" to fight disinformation [00:50:16].
*   **Promoting "Deep listening"**: Engaging in empathetic understanding of other opinions rather than dismissal, especially on a smaller, local scale [00:52:54].
*   **Detecting "dark nudges"**: Actively identifying and countering manipulative uses of behavioral insights that are unhelpful for societal welfare [00:54:14].

## Localized and Adaptive Climate Solutions
[[Behavioral Science]] is also crucial for [[Behavioral insights in public health and pandemic response | localized and adaptive climate solutions]], particularly in climate adaptation efforts [00:46:12]. While traditionally focused on mitigation, adaptation requires tailored, community-specific strategies and micro-interventions due to varying regional impacts [00:46:40]. However, concerns exist that an increased focus on adaptation, which might be easier to gain support for due to its local, quick, and visible effects, could divert resources from essential mitigation efforts, leading to a "mopping with the tap open" scenario [01:24:41]. Behavioral scientists are encouraged to discuss and potentially warn policymakers about this potential friction between adaptation and mitigation priorities [01:25:50].

This continued focus on [[Behavioral Insights]] and effective communication is seen as a milestone for accelerating the green transition and building trust in government and public institutions [01:12:15].

The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed significant [[impacts_and_vulnerabilities_revealed_by_covid19 | impacts and vulnerabilities]] within global health systems, prompting discussions on future reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This includes evaluating what practices should be discontinued, what successful pre-crisis methods should be retained, and what new approaches are needed given the system's vulnerabilities to shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## Initial System Readiness and Adaptation

The crisis has necessitated incredibly rapid changes in health systems, particularly concerning technology use, staff re-qualification and redeployment, and behavioral change communication with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

### Latvia
Despite having one of the worst-funded health systems in the EU, Latvia achieved a "miracle" by regrouping and reorganizing its resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. The system leveraged its strong, "old school" epidemiological services for test and trace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a> and established good cooperation with private providers to dramatically increase testing capacity in a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. This success highlighted how people can be more innovative than institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

### Ireland
Ireland's health system was not ready for the scale of change, facing a shortage of critical care beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Significant work was required to build up surge capacity and develop acute and critical care plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. The willingness of all staff, especially nursing staff, to undertake training and support intensive preparations was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. Most routine elective care activity had to be deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>, leading to a backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Recruiting staff for dedicated testing was also a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

### South Korea
South Korea's success in managing the crisis is attributed to three factors:
1.  **Capacity for Diagnosis**: Early enhancement of PCR testing capacity, reaching over 25,000 cases per day, allowing exposed and suspected patients to be tested rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
2.  **Existing Data Infrastructure**: Leveraging the national health insurance system, which covers 100% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. This included a national drug utilization system for real-time tracking of prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>, and a mask distribution system that tracked purchasing history to prevent panic buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. The system also uses credit card and CCTV information for epidemiological investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>.
3.  **Governance of Relevant Organizations**: All relevant organizations, including local governments, were linked under the central disaster management headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

These factors were possible due to a single unified health insurance system, an advanced national information infrastructure, and lessons learned from the MERS crisis in 2015, which led to the development of a crisis management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. The crisis highlighted the importance of a sound healthcare delivery system and universal health coverage for resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. Public behavior, such as widespread facial mask use due to prior pollution issues, also contributed to keeping case levels low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.

### Sweden
Sweden managed to scale up capacity, doubling ICU beds and maintaining availability from the start of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>. A significant "frog leap" was made in creating a [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_health_innovations | digitalized health system]], delivering services digitally for follow-up visits, chronic conditions monitoring, prescription renewals, and consultations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>. Accurate information was key for fighting the pandemic and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. The pandemic also fostered tight collaboration within Sweden's fragmented health system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>, bridging gaps between national, regional, and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>. This was driven by a single, unifying goal to combat the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.

### Israel
Israel, a country with tight health spending and a thinly stretched healthcare system (nearly 100% bed occupancy in winter, low OECD spending) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>, was not unfamiliar with emergencies and had a long-standing, drilled pandemic contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>. Key aspects of their response included:
1.  **Proactive Protection of Vulnerable Groups**: Early and intensive efforts to inform and protect the elderly and high-risk groups, encouraging them to stay home and avoid exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Early Mass Diagnostic Testing**: Free, large-scale PCR testing at one of the highest global rates (over 80,000 tests per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>.
3.  **Timely Adaptation of Hospital Care**: Rapid understanding that ventilation was not always ideal, leading to adaptations in supportive care and proning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:00">[26:05:00]</a>, contributing to low case fatality rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>.
4.  **Rapid Transition to Online Care**: Leveraging existing digital health infrastructure to focus on proactive preventive medicine and chronic disease management from afar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>.

## Managing the Double Burden of Care

The pandemic presented a "double burden," where health systems struggled to maintain non-COVID emergency services alongside the pandemic response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18:00">[27:18:00]</a>.

### Latvia
In the spring, Latvia closed most planned services to keep hospital beds vacant for COVID-19, despite low case numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>. This severely affected accessibility for planned services, exacerbating existing long waiting lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:55:00">[28:55:00]</a>. In the second wave, the goal was to keep healthcare open as much as possible by reorganizing bed capacities for COVID patients, but by shrinking ambulatory care rather than planned care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:00">[29:25:00]</a>. A major challenge is the shortage of healthcare workers, many working in multiple places, making it difficult to apply strict safety protocols without shutting down half the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>. Latvia is also working on developing home healthcare, including portable oxygen monitoring systems, with family doctors as a fundamental pillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:00">[31:39:00]</a>.

### Ireland
Ireland faced a challenge with key workers self-isolating and widespread weariness among frontline staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:00">[33:27:00]</a>. They rolled out [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_health_innovations | telehealth]] in GP practices and OPD clinics, and fast-tracked the implementation of electronic transfer of prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>. A COVID-19 tracker app was also introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>. There's a focus on community support in health and well-being, including a "community call" where volunteers helped elderly people, and involvement from sporting organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>.

### Sweden
Sweden intentionally avoided a strict lockdown to protect the broader health system and public health, for instance, by keeping schools open to prevent negative health effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>. While the first wave impacted the health system through reallocated resources, stopped screening programs, and elective surgeries, many patients also avoided scheduled appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:00">[37:34:00]</a>. In the second wave, the health system bounced back quickly, with elective surgery largely back up to speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>. The health workforce is very tired, but there's a 30% increase in applications for doctors and nurses programs in universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a>. There is an increased need to invest in preventive measures and public health to tackle waiting times, not just by performing more surgical interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:00">[39:10:00]</a>.

### South Korea
In areas with high prevalence, such as Daegu, where hospital beds were short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:00">[43:35:00]</a>, the government divided care facilities into three levels: general hospitals for severe COVID-19 patients, "living care centers" for low-level care, and home isolation with regular checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:03:00">[44:03:00]</a>. South Korea did not see an increase in 30-day mortality for other diseases like myocardial infarction, which was attributed to separating patient tracks for COVID-19, other respiratory diseases, and non-pulmonary diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:42:00">[44:42:00]</a>.

## Rethinking Public Health Systems and Future Directions

The pandemic has highlighted that public health is a complex public policy issue, inextricably linked to the economy, jobs, education, and transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:42:00">[46:42:00]</a>.

### Ireland
Ireland increased public health funding by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:21:00">[47:21:00]</a>. New approaches include [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_health_innovations | e-medicine]] and online consultations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:00">[47:48:00]</a>. There is a focus on prevention, tackling obesity, and promoting physical activity through campaigns like "Ireland running" and "keep well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:59:00">[47:59:00]</a>. Public buy-in and goodwill have been crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:39:00">[48:39:00]</a>. The crisis has provided an opportunity to resolve long-standing issues and empower the health service, fostering a genuine appreciation from the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:29:00">[50:29:00]</a>.

### Latvia
The pandemic has created an opportunity to end the false dilemma of "health versus economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>. Expert advice emphasizes that an adequate response to pandemics involves implementing universal health care approaches and promoting health, which are strongly tied to socioeconomic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:26:00">[52:26:00]</a>. Health care systems only impact about 20% of population health, with other factors like well-being, household situation, and environmental issues playing a larger role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:00">[53:01:00]</a>. It is crucial for politicians to follow expert advice, even when it involves tough, unpopular decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:31:00">[53:31:00]</a>. Tackling inequalities in society is seen as essential, as economic insecurity can drive individuals to work with mild symptoms, undermining restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.

### Sweden
The crisis has largely accelerated existing trends like [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_health_innovations | digitalization]], patient-centeredness, collaboration in the health system, and focus on public health measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:25:00">[55:25:00]</a>. However, it also forced a rethinking of society's over-reliance on timely delivery and lack of strategic reserves, leading to shortages of PPE and medical equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:05:00">[56:05:00]</a>. There is a new learning to be more adaptive and react faster to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:16:00">[57:16:00]</a>. It's crucial to collaborate more effectively with civil society and industry, not just the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:56:00">[57:56:00]</a>.

### South Korea
In Korea, the pandemic has strongly necessitated a redesign of the health system towards a more public sector-dominant model, moving beyond just accelerating existing changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:31:00">[59:31:00]</a>. The crisis is seen as an opportunity to redefine what constitutes a "good health system," with a new emphasis on safety as a form of "human security" at the national level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

### Israel
The pandemic has been the "best accelerator" of [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_health_innovations | digital health]] in Israel, overcoming years of resistance and bureaucracy in days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. Once digital, there's no going back to "analog medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. The focus is on true digital transformation, redesigning care processes augmented by technology, moving towards proactive, asynchronous, and precision medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. There is a strong hope that governments will realize the economic impact of maintaining a barely sustainable healthcare system and invest in safety margins, recognizing that pandemics are here to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>.

## Personal Commitments and Lasting Lessons

Participants reflected on personal commitments to change:
*   **Israel**: Ran Balicer committed to remembering that it's "not over until it's over," emphasizing vigilance to avoid the "price of hubris" that led to a second wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.
*   **Latvia**: Minister Ilze Viņķele committed to focusing more on tackling inequalities in society, as economic vulnerability directly impacts adherence to health measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.
*   **South Korea**: Sun Min Kim committed to building a sound healthcare delivery system and emphasizing universal health care coverage for resilience and preparedness for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.
*   **Sweden**: Olivia Wixel committed to speeding up processes in their agency, increasing the use of data from registers for research and statistics, and having a clearer, more focused message on priorities for the healthcare sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>.
*   **Ireland**: Minister Frank Feighan highlighted the importance of [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_health_innovations | technology]] in delivering care (teleconsultations, e-prescribing) and the need to build on international collaboration structures (e.g., with the EU and WHO) for better preparedness for future pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. The pandemic has demonstrated that national responses alone are insufficient for global problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>.

The [[pandemic_impact_on_government_practices | pandemic impact on government practices]] suggests a potential shift in population behavior, with more people reflecting on life's priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>. While lifestyle changes for chronic disease patients are not fully clear, the crisis highlighted the critical link between broader societal well-being and health outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>.

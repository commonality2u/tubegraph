This article summarizes key discussions from the International Conference on Governments Beyond Recovery and Towards a Future-Fit Public Sector, a virtual event hosted by the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU, the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, and the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA), with support from the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The conference brought together policymakers, practitioners, regulators, civil society, private sector actors, and innovators to explore new possibilities for public governance as the world emerges from crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Imperative for a Future-Fit Public Sector

The conference emphasizes the need for [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], adaptation, [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]], and co-creation to shape a better future for governments, societies, and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant challenges for governments, necessitating bold and decisive responses to support businesses, households, and save lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. This public support amounted to a massive 27% of GDP across OECD countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

The economic recovery is underway, with global growth projected to reach 5.7% this year and 4.5% next year, driven by policy support, vaccine development, and accelerating digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. However, the recovery remains uneven, with new outbreaks posing the biggest risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

### Key Priorities for Governments:
*   **Vaccine Distribution:** An all-out effort to vaccinate the world population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   **Economic Optimization:** Flexible and targeted policy support towards future-focused investment in green and digital transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **Climate Change:** More ambitious and globally coordinated action towards net-zero emissions by 2050, requiring better data on policy impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation:** Seizing opportunities while managing risks like cybersecurity, privacy, and skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   **International Cooperation:** Strengthening global engagement to solve evolving challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## Lessons from the Pandemic: Preparedness, Flexibility, and Innovation

The pandemic revealed varying levels of preparedness among countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. Slovenia, for example, had received recommendations from the World Health Organization three years prior but missed the opportunity to implement them, leading to struggles with responses and overwhelmed healthcare systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

The initial European response was characterized by disorganization and chaos, with borders closing and logistical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. However, subsequent phases demonstrated a "success story" of coordination regarding recovery funds and financial support for vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

### Key Learnings:
*   **Preparation and Flexibility:** These two qualities are crucial for addressing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.
*   **Democratic Systems vs. Centralized Control:** While some less democratic systems initially reacted faster due to the ability to "take measures over the night," long-term innovation, such as vaccine development, originated from countries with free markets, freedom, and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation:** Access to aggregated data (e.g., across the EU) could have significantly improved response times and targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   **Trust in Science:** A clear division exists in Europe, with higher trust in science in Western Europe compared to Central and Eastern Europe, posing a problem for implementing science-based decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>.

The prime minister of Slovenia, Mr. Jan≈°a, expressed increased confidence in governments' future responses due to lessons learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. Mr. Ongaro from EIPA echoed this optimism, noting that mistakes made early in the pandemic are no longer being repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. However, a poll conducted during the conference showed the audience's opinion on government confidence was more balanced, indicating that while there is some optimism, skepticism remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

## Integrating Strategic Foresight and Innovation

The public sector needs to strategically embed [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_policy_making | strategic foresight]] at the heart of policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. This commitment is central to the OECD Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]], adopted by 43 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Redefining Public Administration:
Mr. Ongaro suggests that while the term "public administration" itself may not be outdated, the approach needs to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. Public services should prioritize people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.
*   **Empowering People:** Public sector employees should be empowered to improve things rather than solely following procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.
*   **Mindset Shift:** It requires a change in mindset, fostering the ability to adapt to different situations and think differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.
*   **Recruitment and Evaluation:** Recruitment should focus on the ability to react to situations and manage change, not just rote knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. Opening up public sector positions to private sector talent and vice-versa could also foster better understanding and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.
*   **Technology as an Enabler:** Digital transformation and technology are crucial enablers, but their effective use depends on changing people's mindsets and workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

## Tackling Long-Term Challenges: Climate Change and Cross-Border Governance

Unlike the immediate crisis of the pandemic, climate change presents a long-term challenge requiring [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | long-term planning]] and [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_government_organizations | strategic foresight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.
*   **Global Collaboration:** Climate change can only be effectively tackled at a global level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.
*   **Investment in Innovation:** The primary strategic answer to climate change is investing much more in technologies that produce clean energy, moving beyond current limitations like lithium-based batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.
*   **European Leadership:** The European Union is crucial in leading this effort by setting ambitious CO2-neutral goals by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>. However, this incurs an economic price, and public skepticism, partly due to low trust in science, can hinder the necessary large-scale investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **Sharing Knowledge:** While Europe has a "huge treasure" of countries that have found answers to various problems, this knowledge is not exploited enough due to bureaucratic obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. Initiatives like Erasmus and quality systems like CAF (Common Assessment Framework) help distribute knowledge and foster healthy competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>.

## Conclusion

The conference highlighted the importance of moving beyond recovery efforts to build a truly [[public_sector_capacity_for_anticipatory_innovation | future-fit public sector]]. This involves being better prepared for future challenges, whether immediate or long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>. It requires fostering an [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]-friendly society where citizens, from a young age, are taught how to utilize information, prioritize, and develop essential skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:22:17]</a>. Enhanced cooperation between European countries, through knowledge sharing and collaborative training platforms, is crucial to avoiding redundant efforts and accelerating progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>.

The discussion reinforced that being "a little bit out of the comfort zone" is necessary for change and [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:16">[01:25:16]</a>.

Mission-oriented innovation policy is a coordinated package of policy and regulatory measures designed to mobilize science, technology, and innovation (STI) to address significant societal challenges within a defined timeframe and with measurable goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This approach spans multiple stages of the innovation cycle and utilizes various policy instruments, from supply-side to demand-side and regulatory measures, crossing different policy fields, sectors, and disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Key Dimensions of Mission Orientation

The OECD identifies three main dimensions of mission orientation, each presenting specific challenges:

### Strategic Orientation
The core challenge in strategic orientation is building broad consensus on selected societal challenges and translating them into clear, bold, and measurable objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Key questions include:
*   How to create customized missions for specific situations, considering scope, depth, granularity, focus, and boldness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   How to secure and balance the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, including politicians, experts, policymakers, and citizens, without diluting the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Policy Coordination
This dimension focuses on coordinating public and private actors across disciplinary, sectoral, and policy silos to work towards shared mission objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Challenges involve:
*   Engaging policy bodies beyond the traditional STI (Science, Technology, and Innovation) area, extending to sectoral ministries and regulatory bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   Coordinating actors across different levels of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   Establishing [[governance_structures_for_crossborder_cooperation | governance structures]] that can be complex and require significant negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Policy Implementation
The challenge here is to effectively implement packages of complementary policy and regulatory instruments to achieve agreed-upon objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Key questions include:
*   How to connect supply-side and demand-side instruments in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   How to manage "solution-neutral" portfolios that address problems rather than predefined solutions, requiring significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   How to monitor and evaluate these systemic policies effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## The Bright Side of Missions
Despite the challenges, [[mission_setting_and_policy_making | mission-oriented policies]] offer a dedicated and tailored space for [[collaborative_governance_and_breaking_silos_in_mission_implementation | collective action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This space is adapted to specific areas and institutional settings, allowing for co-creation of objectives and targets, establishment of specific governance structures, and the design and implementation of intentional policy mixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This systemic approach is developed gradually through experimentation and learning, enabling organizations to start with early steps and build upon existing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Missions in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)
When considering missions in LMICs, it's important to differentiate between:
*   **Complicated problems** (e.g., connecting all schools to the internet) which are about accelerating progress against specific goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Complex challenges** (e.g., family planning missions aiming for safe access to methods, requiring technical innovation, changes in gender norms, and notions about family) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Missions in LMICs also vary in scale, from global (e.g., vaccine access) to national and city-level place-based initiatives (e.g., fiber optic cable in Colombia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The involvement of bilateral development providers, multilateral institutions, international financial institutions, national governments, and social movements adds significant complexity to mission formulation and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

Specific considerations for missions in LMICs include:
*   **Strategic Orientation:** The degree to which a mission is localized and owned by national actors (government, civil society, social movements) versus externally driven is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Missions must reflect the capabilities and capacities of the national innovation ecosystem, often requiring integral technology transfer models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Policy Coordination:** Existing international development coordination mechanisms (e.g., UN system, poverty reduction strategies, humanitarian clusters) need to be assessed for their fitness for purpose in advancing cross-sectoral work without falling into "morphic mimicry" â€“ simply copying approaches from elsewhere without undergoing deep institutional transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **Policy Implementation:** The "projectification" of work, common in international development cooperation, poses a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Securing long-term commitment is difficult due to changing priorities and "development fads" in the global North <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Missions require investment in competing solutions, which contrasts with established project-based development practices and necessitates significant reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

## The OECD Mission Actions Lab
The OECD, through its Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation, and Development Cooperation Directorate, is establishing a Mission Actions Lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. The lab aims to:
*   Help operationalize ambitions and experiment with making missions work in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
*   Provide practical insights on [[long-term_governance_of_missions | long-term governance of missions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   Address challenges such as old systems, silos, and structures that are not fit for purpose for mission-oriented policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
*   Engage in cross-disciplinary collaboration across countries, including LMICs, to learn from on-the-ground experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
*   Select demonstration cases to work on delivery and test new ways of coordinating and governing missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
*   Focus on areas like governing missions, policy setting and implementation, operationalization, and contextual factors including procurement, working across government bodies, and engaging external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

## Practitioner Insights on Challenges in Implementation and Governance

### CSIRO, Australia
CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, defines missions as coordinated packages of projects and initiatives mobilizing STI to address well-defined objectives related to societal challenges, but specifically omits the word "policy" due to its position within the Australian innovation landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. Unlike some European models, CSIRO does not have a central pool of government funding; instead, it aims to "crowd in" existing financial and other resources from industry, government, research, and civil society stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. This creates an imperative to coordinate efforts across the innovation system while balancing market validation and external revenue generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.

CSIRO has identified 12 mission candidates across six societal challenges where it has core STI capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. Four missions have been formally launched for a 5-7 year implementation:
*   **Hydrogen Industry Mission:** Enable a globally competitive Australian hydrogen industry, targeting H2 under $2 per kilo by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>.
*   **Future Protein:** Grow Australia's protein industry by $10 billion by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>.
*   **Trusted Agrifoods:** Increase the value of Australian food exports by $10 billion by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
*   **Drought Resilience:** Reduce the negative impacts of drought by 30% by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>.

The biggest challenge for CSIRO is **scaling up** the launched missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>. This includes questions about incentives, ongoing [[evaluation_and_metrics_in_missionoriented_policy | monitoring and evaluation]] frameworks, and clear decision-making points for intervention if programs are not delivering outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. A key task is also to differentiate between mission-related activities (aspiring to occupy a third of CSIRO's external revenue) and other impactful activities, like spin-out companies or normal research discoveries, providing alternative pathways outside the mission framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>.

### Research Council of Norway (RCN)
The RCN has experience with **bottom-up, inter-agency work**, such as the "Pilot-E" scheme, which started organically from entrepreneurial individuals in agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. This scheme links different agency tools to accelerate technology development, exemplified by the development of electric ferries in Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>. This bottom-up approach allows circumnavigation of many formal and cultural issues at a small scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>.

Challenges arise when **scaling up** these successful schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. Different agencies have varying cultures and ways of working, leading to small but complex formal issues (e.g., publicizing applicant names) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. When ministries and politicians become involved, "prestige issues" can complicate efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. The RCN is working on harmonizing legal issues and connecting national missions with European Union and global missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.

The RCN is also looking to "level up" to a **whole-of-government approach** for large-scale industrial transformation (e.g., reducing oil and gas dependency in Norway) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. This requires a broad political agreement and a shift towards a platform for transitions, potentially integrated into a new long-term plan for research and higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. RCN employs a portfolio management system to provide an overview of all relevant initiatives across different programs and budgets, even if not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:32">[01:20:32]</a>.

### UNDP Vietnam
UNDP Vietnam's work stems from a "relevance gap" in addressing complex, fast-moving social-environmental challenges with traditional development organization designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>. As part of its "Deep Demonstrations" initiative, it explores how to facilitate new approaches within an organization with different incentive structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.

In Vietnam, a rapidly growing economy with high environmental costs (e.g., 4th in plastic waste globally), the mission focuses on transitioning from a linear to a [[circular_economy | circular economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. This involves engaging micro, small, and medium enterprises and navigating a rapidly changing financial framework with declining direct grant ODA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

UNDP Vietnam utilizes **portfolio sense-making**, an iterative process of learning from existing projects to identify acceleration opportunities and leverage current resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>. While many interventions on circular economy already exist, they lack interlinkages and effective learning mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.

A concrete example from Da Nang, focusing on plastics and solid waste management, highlighted several challenges:
*   **Creating a Movement:** Underestimating the need for local engagement and buy-in to drive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>. This led to establishing a circular economy Hub to incubate business ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>.
*   **Cross-Departmental/Ministerial Coordination:** Difficulties in bringing different local government departments and national ministries together around a shared mission, despite existing policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
*   **Adapting the Portfolio:** The need for a portfolio that can adapt to unexpected learnings and allow for pivoting during implementation, which current development project mechanisms often do not permit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.
*   **Reframing the Challenge:** Using a team-based, design-led "studio approach" with diverse backgrounds (architects, journalists, economists, biologists) helped reframe the circular economy transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. Key learnings included recognizing that the mandate for circular economy should extend beyond the environment ministry, treating it as an emergency (like COVID response), and pitching it as future-proofing and risk management with economic incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

### Innovation Fund Denmark
Innovation Fund Denmark is implementing Denmark's first truly [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | mission-driven program]], with 100 million Euros (700 million DKK) allocated in 2021 for four green research missions (PTX, carbon capture, agriculture/food, circular economy, plastic/textiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>. The process involves asking stakeholders (universities, industry, cluster organizations) to define roadmaps, then selecting and combining these for calls for partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.

Key [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_health_missions | challenges]] include:
*   **Measuring Impact:** Difficulty in measuring the impact of different roadmaps, especially when comparing diverse goals like greenhouse gas reduction and competitiveness for Danish companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Involvement:** Battling among stakeholders, particularly researchers, who seek funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
*   **Balancing Focus and Agility:** Maintaining focus on the roadmap while allowing for agility as the world changes, and incentivizing new companies and researchers to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.
*   **Stopping Failing Projects:** A significant legal and cultural challenge is developing a method to stop projects that are not progressing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Industry Engagement:** Incentivizing greater industry involvement, as the allocated funds are insufficient to solve the large mission problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.
*   **Policy Integration:** Combining science policy with demand-side policies (e.g., consumer behavior, regulation) to ensure that technological ideas translate into real-world solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

## Overarching Challenges
Throughout the discussion, common themes emerged regarding the complexities of implementing [[mission_oriented_policies | mission-oriented policies]]:
*   **Overcoming "Projectification":** Moving beyond short-term, siloed project-based thinking towards a sustained, systemic approach.
*   [[evaluation_and_metrics_in_missionoriented_policy | **Evaluation of Missions]]:** Developing robust metrics and methodologies to assess impact across diverse goals and long timeframes.
*   **Scope and Dilution:** Deciding how many missions an organization can effectively focus on without diluting efforts and resources.
*   **Organizational Culture:** Managing the cultural shift within organizations, especially when scaling up bottom-up initiatives that may lose their agile, entrepreneurial spirit when subjected to formal structures and prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.
*   **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Ensuring that mission governance structures allow for adaptation and pivoting as new learnings emerge or conditions change, rather than being "mission-locked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

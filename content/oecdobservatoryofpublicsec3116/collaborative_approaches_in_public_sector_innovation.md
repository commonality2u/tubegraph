The co-creation boot camp brought together 100 individuals from diverse sectors, including the [[Public sector innovation | public sector]], private sector, academia, and civil society organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The primary goal of this initiative was to [[collaboration_and_innovation_in_public_sector | co-create]] solutions addressing challenges in civic participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These challenges were identified by [[Public sector innovation | public sector]] teams from Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands, who committed to [[collaboration_and_innovation_in_public_sector | collaborate]] with society to find solutions, specifically leveraging emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Objectives and Focus
The core aim of the challenges tackled was to prioritize people, utilizing technologies such as AI, blockchain, and VR as tools to enhance democratic participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This approach sought to make governance more inclusive and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Collaborative Design Sprint Methodology

To transition from identified challenges to prototype solutions, participants organized into teams and followed a structured design sprint process developed by the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This methodology, an example of [[Public sector innovation methods and strategies | public sector innovation strategies]], fostered intensive [[Collaboration and public sector partnerships | collaboration]] and iterative development.

### 1. Aligning on the Challenge
The initial step involved teams achieving a shared understanding of the civic participation challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This encompassed comprehending the problem's context, previous attempts to address it, identifying key stakeholders and users, potential barriers to implementation, and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This ensured a unified understanding and clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### 2. Ideation of Solutions
Following the alignment phase, teams engaged in rapid brainstorming to generate a wide array of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Ideas were quickly generated, discussed, discarded, and prioritized to effectively address the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### 3. Solution Sketching
The most promising ideas were further developed into well-articulated solution sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Teams created quick drawings to visualize and give shape to their proposed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### 4. Review and Refinement
After sketching, teams dedicated time to review and refine their ideas, narrowing down the possibilities to select one for prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### 5. Prototyping
The second day of the boot camp was entirely dedicated to developing the chosen idea into a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Teams began by creating a minimal prototype canvas based on their sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They explored various approaches, from using digital tools and emerging technologies to traditional materials like Legos and modeling clay, to quickly achieve a tangible representation of their solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### 6. Final Pitches
Teams prepared final pitches to showcase their solutions developed over the two-day period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. These 5-minute presentations were delivered to other participants and a jury of experts from Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Outcomes and Future Implications
Following the pitches, three solutions were selected for further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. These prototypes were recognized for pushing the boundaries of civic participation through emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The ideas generated during this [[Public sector innovation and collaboration | collaborative]] boot camp are expected to shape the future of civic participation across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

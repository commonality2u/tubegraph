To fully realize the benefits of innovation, governments must rethink how they regulate and develop more [[agile_regulatory_governance | agile approaches to regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This necessitates creating space for experimentation, fostering policy learning and adaptation, and providing incentives for businesses to develop new products, services, ideas, and business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Role of Regulatory Sandboxes

[[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | Regulatory sandboxes]] are highlighted as a key agile approach to regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. They involve diverse practices and are applied across various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The objectives of focusing on regulatory sandboxes include:
*   Taking stock of existing practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Demystifying their practical application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Providing insights on how to mainstream this approach across governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Despite their potential, there is still a gap between what governments perceive about regulatory sandboxes and their actual practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Core Contributions of Regulatory Sandboxes

A poll indicated that 65% of respondents believe the main value of regulatory sandboxes is to gain insights from businesses on emerging developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. This addresses the "regulatory lag" where government regulation struggles to keep pace with innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Specifically, sandboxes help:
*   Provide insights on the early stages of technological developments, including risks, opportunities, regulatory overlaps, duplications, and incompleteness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   Foster policy learning by building on business expertise, as businesses are often aware of developments before governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   Enable innovators to test and trial new ideas, products, services, and business models with regulatory supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. This builds confidence in compliance and accelerates the delivery of assured, trusted products to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   Foster a culture of exploration within regulators, making them more open to experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example from the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)
> The ICO views its regulatory sandbox as a tool to enable innovators to test ideas using personal data under supervision, ensuring compliance and accelerating trusted products to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. It supports work in areas like tackling financial crime and biometric solutions for airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

## Current State of Play in the EU

A survey among EU member states found that 19 states have some experience with regulatory sandboxes, mostly established in 2019-2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

Key findings include:
*   **Legal Basis**: Some cases use existing regulations for experimentation, while others adapt primary or secondary legislation, often through exemptions or derogations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.
*   **Sectors**: Majority are in finance and transport, but increasingly in energy. They also appear in social fields (e.g., Finland's subsidies for hiring unemployed) and education (e.g., Romania's hotmail in schools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>.
*   **Duration**: Most last about five years or only one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.
*   **Size**: Divergent, from a few hundred participants in the Netherlands to only one in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>. The question remains whether a significant number of entities is needed for real efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Over 20% have already led to regulatory changes, while half report it's too early to tell the impact on existing law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

At the EU level, experimentation clauses exist in EU law for sectors like aviation security and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. The term "regulatory sandbox" is more recent, appearing in proposals for artificial intelligence regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a> and prominently in the financial sector, which has a well-developed agile regulatory approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

### Danish Experience: Energy Sector

In Denmark, a regulatory sandbox program, launched in 2020, aims to shorten the time between identifying a regulatory issue and enacting proper regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. It allows for exemptions already permitted by current legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

Key insights from Denmark:
*   **Dialogue**: It facilitates great communication with innovative projects, providing insights into the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.
*   **Complexity**: Projects are often complex, dealing with infrastructure-related regulations, not just digital ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.
*   **Internal Processes**: It has revealed how to design internal processes and "prep" expert teams to handle applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>.
*   **Guidance**: Projects often misidentify their regulatory barriers. The sandbox provides crucial guidance and advice, sometimes resolving issues without needing a formal sandbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.
*   **Guardrails**: Significant thought is put into defining the delineation between the sandbox and regular regulation to ensure safety and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

From a business perspective, sandboxes enable work in a wider, basically unrestricted field, providing broader reach for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. They break barriers between regulators and innovators, fostering more open discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Businesses commit to using this freedom to invest in learning and provide tangible results for the agency, informing future legislation and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.

## Implementation and Challenges

### Key Success Factors and Challenges
*   **Planning**: Define clear goals (beyond just testing), competencies, rules of procedure, and eligibility criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
*   **Assessment & Monitoring**: Plan for assessment and monitoring processes, including public reporting of results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Engagement**: Meet with potential applicants in advance to reconcile expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>. Communication between regulators and innovators is crucial, ideally through a "one-stop shop" that combines different ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:22">[00:52:22]</a>.
*   **Regulator Flexibility**: Regulators must be flexible and prepared to work cross-border and cross-sector, involving specialists from diverse backgrounds (e.g., data protection, consumer protection, competition experts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>.
*   **Internal Knowledge Sharing**: Establish mechanisms for supervisory knowledge sharing, such as internal innovation offices or networks of institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.
*   **Public Communication**: Communicate results and information to the public through various channels (press, radio, social media, direct dialogue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.

### Common Definition and Harmonization
While there's debate on a common legal definition for regulatory sandboxes, a common understanding of their direction (promoting innovation with safeguards) is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. Guidance from competent authorities can resolve many unclarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>. A common legal mandate is likely not feasible across borders due to varied local quirks and specific sectoral needs (e.g., financial services vs. industrial emissions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.

### [[challenges_of_implementing_agile_governance | Challenges of implementing agile governance]]
*   **Determining the Right Level**: Identifying whether to initiate a sandbox at local, national, or EU level, depending on the sector and time to scale up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.
*   **Engaging Innovators**: Encouraging agile startups to participate, which is crucial for closing the innovation gap in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   **Unpredictability**: Innovation by nature is unpredictable, making it difficult to set rigid success criteria from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>. The approach needs to embody flexibility, recognizing that "failing is a learning and learning is part of the journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Resource Intensity**: Requires significant investment in resources and skills from both public and private sides for effective collaboration and evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.

### [[publicprivate_partnerships_in_regulation | Public-Private Partnerships]] and Competition
Regulatory sandboxes, while offering advantages, need to be managed to avoid distorting competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>:
*   **Transparency and Knowledge Sharing**: Crucial to inform those outside the sandbox about information, data, and knowledge gained to minimize preferential treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a>.
*   **Conditions and Safeguards**: Sandboxes can include conditions that allow termination if they impede competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>. They must operate within a clear framework that sets limits on time, turnover, and scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a>.
*   **Data Sharing**: During the sandbox phase, it may be justified to ask participants to share more data than under normal regulation to foster transparency and allow broader participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a>.
*   **Predictability**: For large-scale investments, predictability is key, though the advantage gained by early participants is accepted as the "cost of developing the model" to benefit society more broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:54">[01:23:54]</a>.

## Broader Context and Future Outlook

[[regulatory_sandboxes_and_innovation | Regulatory sandboxes]] should be seen as one part of a broader regulatory strategy, not the sole tool for promoting innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:21">[01:28:21]</a>. They are particularly effective at the early stages of technological development to foster policy learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:39">[01:29:39]</a>. However, as technology evolves and understanding grows, there may be a need to transition to other regulatory or non-regulatory approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:47">[01:29:47]</a>. Regulation must be dynamic and adapt to the pace of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.

The [[impacts_of_technological_change_on_regulation | impacts of technological change on regulation]] mean that [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovations in regulatory systems]] are vital. While [[sectorspecific_applications_of_regulatory_sandboxes | sector-specific applications of regulatory sandboxes]] are common, particularly in areas affected by digitalization, the potential for sandboxes extends to all sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:04">[01:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>.

[[The role of data in regulation | The role of data in regulation]] and [[goalbased_regulation_in_digital_transformation | goal-based regulation in digital transformation]] are critical considerations for agile regulatory approaches.

> [!TIP] Cross-Border Cooperation
> Given that digital technologies often transcend national boundaries, cross-border regulatory sandboxes are increasingly important. While challenging, they deserve attention to avoid inefficiency and fragmented solutions in a global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:35">[01:30:35]</a>. Separate testing of similar innovations (e.g., self-driving cars in different countries) risks developing divergent supervisory practices and regulatory solutions, potentially fragmenting the single market and hindering innovation scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:22">[01:55:22]</a>.

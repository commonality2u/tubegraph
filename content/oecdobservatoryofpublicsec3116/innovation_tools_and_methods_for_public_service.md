Public servants frequently encounter a wide array of challenges, problems, and situations, none of which are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. [[innovation_models_and_methods_in_the_public_sector | Innovation tools and methods]] can provide new approaches to address these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While there is an abundance of available tools, guides, and playbooks, identifying where and how to begin can be a significant hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Challenge of Tool Overload

Despite the existence of hundreds of excellent [[innovation_models_and_methods_in_the_public_sector | innovation tools]], toolkits, guides, and playbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, the sheer volume can be overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. What is often needed is a "better filter" or a "compass" to guide users toward the appropriate resources for their [[innovation_in_public_service_delivery | innovation journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The OPSI Toolkit Navigator

To address this challenge, the OPSI Toolkit Navigator was developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This resource aims to connect a public servant's specific situation, problem, or challenge to the most relevant toolkit that can provide assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Its primary function is to filter out irrelevant information, offering a clearer path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Development Process

The OPSI Toolkit Navigator was created in collaboration with hundreds of public servants and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The development process involved several key steps:

1.  **Analysis and Organization**
    Hundreds of existing toolkits were analyzed and organized based on the specific actions they inform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  **Situation Exploration**
    Common situations, problems, and challenges faced by public servants were explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
3.  **Conceptualization Understanding**
    Research was conducted to understand how public servants typically describe what they want to achieve and how they conceptualize their situations or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
4.  **Navigational Path Design**
    Based on the above, navigational path options were designed to connect desired actions with appropriate tools, allowing the OPSI Toolkit Navigator to suggest tools based on desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Beyond Tool Selection

While finding the right tool is important, [[innovation_in_public_service_delivery | innovation in public service delivery]] involves more than just tool selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Therefore, the OPSI Toolkit Navigator also provides connections to:

*   Skills and capacity-building resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Real-life case studies of [[impact_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation in practice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Fellow public servants and experts who have experience with similar [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_organizations | innovative approaches in public sector organizations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

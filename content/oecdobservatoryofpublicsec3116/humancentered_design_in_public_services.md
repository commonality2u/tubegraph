Human-centered design is a critical approach in public services, emphasizing the importance of putting people at the core of innovation and service delivery to improve citizens' lives and foster trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>. This approach shifts focus from bureaucracy to the needs and experiences of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:30">[03:51:30]</a>.

## Core Principles

The OECD strongly advocates for "putting the public back into public services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a> and champions a recommendation on [[design_thinking_and_humancentered_design | human-centric public administrative services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. Key objectives for innovating public services through a human-centered lens include:
*   Improving efficiency and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:23">[02:53:23]</a>.
*   Increasing public satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:16">[02:59:16]</a>.
*   Helping uptake of services, particularly for populations facing challenges in access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:07">[03:05:07]</a>.
*   Ensuring fairness and equal treatment in government-citizen relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:04">[03:10:04]</a>.
*   Building citizen trust in governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

This requires a cultural shift in how bureaucracies operate, ensuring citizens are at the center of services provided at important life moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## National Initiatives and Approaches

### Brazil
Brazil views [[innovative_public_service_design | innovation in public services]] not just as a priority but a requirement for improving citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. This [[innovation_tools_and_methods_for_public_service | innovation]] must be human-centered, making services efficient, inclusive, and transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. The National Digital Government Strategy promotes [[digital_transformation_and_inclusion_in_public_services | digital transformation]] across states and municipalities, ensuring easy access to digital government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. This strategy was developed collaboratively, involving public servants, experts, and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

### Portugal
Portugal's Lab X, the center for [[innovation_tools_and_methods_for_public_service | innovation]] in the public sector, exemplifies a crucial mindset for fostering [[innovation_in_public_service_delivery | innovation in public administration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. Its methodology involves:
1.  **Research:** Deeply understanding the real needs and challenges faced by citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
2.  **Co-creation:** Collaborating directly with citizens, researchers, startups, and public servants to design optimal solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.
3.  **Experimentation:** Testing solutions before full implementation, allowing for quick adaptation and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.

The goal of Portugal's national digital strategy is to proactively meet the needs of citizens and businesses, enhancing efficiency and reducing bureaucracy by always putting users at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. This means simplifying people's lives through seamless digital public services, not just adding digital layers but transforming processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.

### Canada
Canada emphasizes that [[Usercentric design and implementation | human centricity]] must be at the center of modernization efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:11]</a>. Canadian digital standards include being open in tool development and inviting users to participate in the design, delivery, and implementation of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:20:00">[31:20:00]</a>. The focus is shifting from a product-based view to a "life events and life journeys" view, bundling services intuitively around major life moments (e.g., death in the family, welcoming a child, retirement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:13:00">[34:13:00]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges and Fostering Inclusion

### Digital Inclusion and Literacy
Ensuring [[digital_transformation_and_inclusion_in_public_services | digital transformation]] leaves no one behind is a key priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24:00">[42:24:00]</a>. Digital access should be an open door for all, not a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:54:00">[43:54:00]</a>. Portugal's widespread network of "citizen spots" and "citizen shops" provides direct and mediated support, helping citizens gain confidence in using digital services autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:10:00">[44:10:00]</a>. These spots also host awareness sessions and provide learning resources for digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:26:00">[45:26:00]</a>. Canada acknowledges the challenge of equal service access across a large country and the need for a digital infrastructure build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>.

### Civic Participation
Public services can and should serve as platforms for public participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:23:00">[46:23:00]</a>. Portugal's `participate.gov.pt` is a national civic engagement platform allowing citizens to transparently propose and vote on ideas and monitor public decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:05:00">[47:05:00]</a>. The "Simplex" program empowers citizens to propose ideas that reduce administrative burdens and shape future public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:47:00">[47:47:00]</a>.

### Design and Measurement
Designing service interfaces from the client's perspective is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:05:00">[34:05:00]</a>. [[Adaptive innovation in public services | Innovation]] should not only focus on cost savings but also on improving the quality of products, ensuring they are accurate and timely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:21:00">[56:21:00]</a>. It's important to measure effectiveness through client surveys and instant feedback to identify pain points and iteratively correct problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:48:00">[57:48:00]</a>. Digitalization should not be for its own sake, but genuinely enhance the client experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:30:00">[57:30:00]</a>.

### Organizational Culture and Leadership
[[Innovation in public service delivery | Innovation]] thrives in environments that foster learning and trust, where people feel safe to share ideas and oppositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:12:00">[38:12:00]</a>. Leaders must embrace change and empower their teams, cultivating an environment where continuous learning and adaptation are embedded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:47:00">[53:47:00]</a>. Investing in public servants, who are the backbone of [[innovation_in_public_service_delivery | innovation]] efforts, is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32:00">[39:32:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, human-centered design aims to ensure that no one is left behind in the digital society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:06:00">[48:06:00]</a>. It promotes equitable access, civic participation, and continuous improvement, ensuring that public services genuinely improve people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

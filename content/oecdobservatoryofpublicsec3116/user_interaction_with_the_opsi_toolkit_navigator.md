The [[opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] is a public service project designed to help users find appropriate innovation toolkits for their specific needs, rather than creating yet another new toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. It was developed to provide "signal through the noise" of hundreds of existing toolkits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Development Based on User Needs

The development of the [[opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] was supported by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It aimed to address the challenge of finding the right tools for public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Key insights from user research with public sector innovators informed its design:
*   **Addressing "Peak Toolkit"** The world did not need another new toolkit; rather, a way to navigate existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Understanding the User Journey** Workshops were conducted in 2017 with public sector leaders and civil servants to understand how they find information, whom they consult, and what [[methods_and_tools_in_innovation_toolkits | tools and methods]] they use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This research informed the structure of the navigator to help people find toolkits based on their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Toolkit Use Challenges**
    *   **Over-reliance on past tools** Users tend to stick with what has worked previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   **Misalignment with problems** Toolkits are often chosen for superficial reasons (e.g., "bright and shiny," or a colleague used it) rather than alignment with the actual problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   **Skill incompatibility** Some toolkits require advanced skills that users may not possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   **Granularity issues** Toolkits can be either too specific or too broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
    *   **Learned helplessness** Users may be reluctant to modify a polished toolkit, even if their context requires it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Characteristics of an Ideal Toolkit

Based on research, the [[opsi_toolkit_navigator_development_and_design | OPSI Toolkit Navigator development and design]] focused on helping users find toolkits that are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>:
*   **Adaptable and Transferable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
*   **Approachable and User-Centered** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>
*   **Action-Oriented** Focused on getting to action, not just guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Modular** Allowing users to combine parts of different toolkits to suit their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Navigating the [[opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]]

The content is organized around "innovation tasks" or "jobs to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. These go beyond typical problem-solving to include:
*   **Problem-Solving Jobs** (e.g., discovery, prototyping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Group Behavioral Jobs** (e.g., building consensus, challenging assumptions, cultivating mindsets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Approach Planning Jobs** (e.g., preliminary scoping, getting started) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Contextualization Jobs** (e.g., visualizing systems, imagining different futures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

Users can access the navigator via its landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

### Browsing and Filtering

Users can navigate the toolkits in several ways:
*   **By Topics** The content is organized by topics and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. For example, selecting "Digital and Technology Transformation" provides an index article with basic principles, OECD guidance, public sector considerations, typical [[methods_and_tools_in_innovation_toolkits | methods and tools]], and advice on choosing a toolkit within that discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   **By Actions ("Take Action Steps")** Users can choose actions like "design a new strategy," which links to collections of toolkits relevant to that specific need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
*   **Filtered Views** Users can apply filters based on various criteria, such as:
    *   **Role** (e.g., policy makers, practitioners, external stakeholders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
    *   **Features** (e.g., toolkits with checklists or specific techniques) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.
*   **Search Bar** Users can use a keyword search to find relevant toolkits based on descriptions and text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

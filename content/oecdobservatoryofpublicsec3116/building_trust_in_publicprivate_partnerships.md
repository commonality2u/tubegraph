Building trust is a crucial element for the success of collaborative, mission-oriented approaches, particularly in areas like public health [00:29:25]. These partnerships are essential because no single actor can solve complex societal challenges alone [00:06:27].

## Why Trust is Essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>

A mission-oriented approach requires new ways of collaborating and aligning on long-term challenges, overcoming silos, and enabling bottom-up experimentation and strategic thinking [00:01:03]. This involves the active [[trust_and_coordination_in_multistakeholder_partnerships | involvement of diverse stakeholders]], often requiring a more common and inclusive language to facilitate participation [00:01:18]. For effective collaboration and co-creation, particularly in successful mission-oriented innovation, providing better conditions for [[partnerships_in_public_private_innovation | building partnerships]] between actors in different sectors, disciplines, and countries is a priority [00:28:23].

## Challenges in Building Trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>

Collaboration isn't always easy, and several challenges can hinder the development of trust in [[publicprivate_partnerships_in_technology_and_innovation | public-private partnerships]]:

*   **Differing Directions** Organizations or individuals often have a limited scope of societal challenges and solutions, leading them to move in slightly different directions and produce sub-optimal outcomes [00:05:26].
*   **Regulatory Reluctance** Regulatory agencies, while important for policy development, might be reluctant to enter partnerships with companies they regulate [00:29:06]. This highlights a challenge in [[publicprivate_partnerships_in_regulation | public-private partnerships in regulation]].
*   **Inter-Industry Collaboration** Historically, industries have not always been accustomed to collaborating among themselves [00:45:00]. This can be a significant hurdle when complex projects require multiple companies to share knowledge that borders on product development or competition [00:45:14].
*   **Personal Egos and Status** Overcoming individual egos, personal status, and existing biases (e.g., academics thinking industry only cares about products, or industry viewing academics as solely seeking Nobel Prizes) is crucial for a collaborative team effort [00:46:53].
*   **Fragmentation** There is a persistent problem of fragmentation in research, healthcare, and education [00:10:27].

## Strategies for Building Trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>

Building [[building_trust_in_public_institutions | trust in public-private partnerships]] requires hard work and a systematic approach:

*   **Common Vision and Commitment**
    *   Setting a common direction and creating a shared understanding and commitment [00:06:08].
    *   Achieving full agreement and buy-in on objectives [00:24:37].
    *   Co-ownership of actions and problems to solve [00:09:01].
    *   Ensuring all collaborators take responsibility in their fields of expertise [00:09:19].
*   **Broad Expertise and Involvement**
    *   Including a broad mix of expertise at different levels, from daily operations to advisory boards [00:17:25].
    *   Crucially, involving patients and their relatives at all steps [00:17:48], recognizing that patients are citizens and their insights are vital for services to deliver on what matters to people [00:37:25].
    *   Cooperating with "unusual" partners, such as ministries of transport or education, to address gaps not traditionally considered within healthcare (e.g., lack of transport for patient access, health literacy for prevention) [00:25:50].
*   **Clear Frameworks and Management**
    *   Establishing a clear legal and intellectual property (IP) framework to define how knowledge is shared and utilized [00:23:47]. This often requires lawyers from different institutions and companies to work together to establish the framework [00:46:06].
    *   Developing a clear work plan where every participant knows their role [00:24:45].
    *   Implementing professional alliance management to oversee large, complex partnerships [00:24:55]. Researchers alone cannot manage such extensive collaborations [00:25:00].
*   **Communication and Transparency**
    *   Consistent and clear communication is key [00:17:54].
    *   [[trust_and_transparency_in_public_policy | Transparency]] within the mission is vital so that all parties know what others are doing, avoiding repetition and ensuring effective use of resources [00:42:36]. This knowledge sharing can also provide valuable lessons for other healthcare areas [00:43:13].
*   **Neutral Leadership and Arenas** Providing a neutral arena with neutral leadership can help overcome difficulties in collaboration, especially when regulatory bodies are involved [00:29:29].
*   **Long-term Perspective and Sustainability** Funders need to collaborate more closely to ensure a long-term perspective on funding [00:30:43] and understand the societal benefits through health economics [00:30:49].
*   **Case-Based Work and Demonstrators** The ability to work case-based and build demonstrators, rather than trying to change the entire system at once, can prove feasibility and foster trust [00:31:01].
*   **Integration and Infrastructure** Building integrated centers with research, education, and healthcare components (e.g., comprehensive cancer centers) provides a strong and sustainable infrastructure background [00:39:57].

## Benefits of Established Trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>

While building trust is hard work and takes time (sometimes three to five years to establish such relationships) [00:46:34], the payoff is much higher than the risks [00:45:32]. It allows for things that cannot be done elsewhere [00:23:31] and leads to sustainable collaboration for life [00:46:39]. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated Europe's ability to unite and rapidly develop new therapies, scaling them to a large population [00:48:10], proving that with a sense of urgency and willingness, such collaboration is achievable.

Governments play a critical role in fostering innovation, particularly in the context of addressing global challenges such as inequality and poverty, which have been exacerbated by crises like the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Their involvement is essential in creating an enabling environment for successful innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Key Principles for Government Engagement

Governments have an important, yet particular, role to play that often differs from that of innovators themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Instead of controlling or duplicating the activities of others, governments should strive to coordinate, facilitate, and nurture innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The analogy of "steering rather than rowing" suggests that governments should guide and support, allowing others to drive the innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### Fostering the Innovation Ecosystem

A crucial aspect of the [[Governments Role in Promoting Innovation | government's role]] is to help create a robust innovation ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This involves providing the necessary regulations, opportunities, and funding for innovation to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Key elements of this ecosystem include:

*   **Innovation Sandboxes and Funding** Governments can establish "innovation sandboxes" with significant funding, offering a space for local innovators to experiment and receive mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This can include matching grants to support social enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Recognizing Local Innovation** It is important to acknowledge that innovators often reside within communities facing challenges, and innovation can be driven from the grassroots level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Governments should encourage and guide these local innovations to be applied effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The concept of "positive deviance" is relevant here, where successful outliers are identified and scaled with government resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Digital Platforms** Governments can create digital platforms to bring together innovators with ideas and those who can help scale them, particularly valuable for smaller countries that may lack resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Incentives and Disincentives** Through mechanisms like budget allocations and regulations, governments can provide incentives and disincentives that encourage private sector participation in national development and citizen welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.
*   **Risk-Taking** Donors and governments need to be more willing to take risks, as supporting locally-driven innovations often requires a departure from traditional, risk-averse approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

## Examples of Government-Supported Innovation

*   **Malaysia's Global Innovation Center** The Malaysian Global Innovation Center (MAGIC) is an example of a government initiative that provides an innovation sandbox with funding, mentorship, and matching grants for local innovators and social enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. It also adopts a regional approach within ASEAN to foster broader market penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Malaysia's Financial Innovation** Malaysia has experimented with Islamic social financing models, such as the *sukuk* model and Islamic bonds, which have been oversubscribed and used to empower local women and communities through livelihood development and health initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.
*   **Malaysia's Employment Programs** The Malaysian government has invested capital and created an ecosystem for employment opportunities, leveraging the private sector for upskilling and reskilling programs. This aims to ensure newly trained individuals are absorbed into relevant industries, addressing unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Government Innovation

The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the urgent need for [[innovation in government | innovation in government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. While there is enthusiasm for innovation, there is a recognized need for more government action to enable it for sustainable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

*   **Repurposing Existing Capabilities** Governments can facilitate the repurposing or adaptation of existing capabilities, such as communication platforms or manufacturing facilities, for new needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. For example, a two-way communication platform (mHero) previously funded for Ebola in Liberia proved crucial for disseminating COVID-19 information to frontline health workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Holistic Approach** Innovation needs to be considered in a multi-sectoral way, beyond just health, to include humanitarian, development, and financial spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. This includes addressing environmental impacts, like the massive increase in PPE waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.
*   **Addressing Connectivity Gaps** The crisis revealed that lack of internet access in some areas can widen socioeconomic gaps, underscoring the need for technological solutions that reach remote populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
*   **Strategic Procurement** Government procurement can be a powerful incentive to align the private sector and startups with public goals, such as addressing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **Partnerships** Effective innovation requires strong partnerships between governments, civil society, communities, and the private sector to leverage expertise and resources, and to localize solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. This can include public-private partnerships, like the one in South Africa enabling local textile mask production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

## Governments and the Private Sector

Governments play a role in guiding the private sector towards solutions that benefit the poorest populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. While traditional private sector innovation was often expensive and focused on affluent markets, a shift towards "frugal innovation" is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. This involves doing more and better with fewer resources, leading to highly affordable solutions that can reach large numbers of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>. Governments can incentivize larger private sector companies to partner with smaller, agile startups to develop and scale these solutions quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

## International Community's Role

The international community, including organizations like the OECD, can facilitate [[knowledge sharing]] and provide resources and political capacity to support innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. In light of the increased financing gap for SDGs due to the COVID-19 crisis, donors need to invest in local structures that drive innovation, as this often costs less and aligns with the principle of localization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. This requires a "mindset shift" towards taking more risks and understanding that sustainable development happens from the bottom up as much as from the top down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. Development cooperation plays a vital role in fostering innovation, requiring closer partnerships with local stakeholders to support context-specific solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>.

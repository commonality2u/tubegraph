Governments play a crucial role in fostering innovation, particularly in the developing world, to address challenges like inequality and poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated global poverty and inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, highlighting an urgent need to promote innovations that benefit the poorest and most vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. A recent poll indicated that while 88% of participants believe innovations can effectively address the challenge of "leaving no one behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, a significant majority (61%) believe that governments and their partners are not doing enough to enable innovation for sustainable development in response to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This suggests a substantial gap and a "huge need for provide innovation to foster change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## Creating an Enabling Environment

A successful innovation ecosystem heavily relies on an enabling local environment, which governments are largely responsible for establishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Nurturing Local Innovation
Innovation is inherently local and often driven by communities facing development or humanitarian challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Governments should recognize and encourage innovators at the community level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Rather than adopting a top-down approach, they should facilitate and nurture, acting as "steerers" rather than "rowers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This involves resisting the temptation to be overly controlling or to duplicate existing activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### Providing Ecosystem Support
Governments play a key [[importance_of_government_involvement_in_innovation | role in building the ecosystem]] necessary for innovation to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This ecosystem requires:
*   **Regulations and Opportunities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Funding:** Providing significant funding for local innovators, often through mechanisms like matching grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. An example is Malaysia's Global Innovation Center, which created an "innovation sandbox" with funding and mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Platforms for Collaboration:** Creating digital platforms that connect grassroots innovators with larger organizations and resources that can help scale their ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. The [[role_of_oecd_in_public_sector_innovation | OECD]] and organizations like USAID (e.g., Million Lives Club) facilitate such knowledge sharing and platform creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

## [[innovation_strategies_for_governments | Innovation Strategies for Governments]] in Crisis Response

The COVID-19 crisis has presented both challenges and opportunities for [[innovation_strategies_for_governments | government innovation]].

### Leveraging Existing Capabilities
Governments can effectively repurpose or adapt existing infrastructure and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. For instance, a two-way communication platform (mHero) initially funded during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia was crucial for sharing COVID-19 information with frontline health workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Mapping digital health solutions across countries also empowers governments with information on readily available tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

### Promoting Frugal Innovation
[[role_and_development_of_innovation_tools_for_government | Frugal innovation]], characterized by "doing more and better for more people with less resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>, is particularly relevant. This approach, inspired by grassroots solutions, focuses on using existing resources to create highly affordable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. Examples during COVID-19 include local maker spaces creating face masks from available materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>, repurposing train compartments into mobile wards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>, and re-evaluating existing affordable drugs like dexamethasone for treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

### Addressing Multi-Sectoral Needs
Innovation is not just for the health sector, but also crucial for humanitarian, development, and financial spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. Governments should consider the broader impacts, such as the environmental burden of PPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>, and explore innovative financial instruments like Islamic social financing to empower local communities and support livelihoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. Addressing challenges like cold chains for vaccines in remote areas or creating new logistics solutions are also critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.

## The Role of Partnerships in Innovation

Effective innovation requires strong partnerships between governments, the private sector, and citizens.

### Collaborative Ecosystem
Governments, through their [[the_role_of_public_sector_in_innovation | public sector]] entities, can create a space that connects entrepreneurs, grassroots innovators, and larger organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Larger organizations can then select promising ideas and use their resources to scale them, as seen in the partnership between Pfizer and BioNTech for vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.

### Private Sector Engagement
The private sector, including multinational corporations and agile startups, has a huge [[importance_of_government_involvement_in_innovation | role to play]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. Governments can incentivize private sector participation through:
*   **Procurement:** Government procurement can be a powerful incentive for aligning innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Sandboxes:** Creating environments where companies can experiment with new ideas and bring them to market faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
*   **Co-financing:** Development finance corporations can explore co-financing opportunities with private investors to attract capital into areas like global health, using grants to lower risk for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
*   **Skills Development:** Governments can leverage the private sector for upskilling and reskilling initiatives, aligning training with industry needs to address unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>.

Private sector innovation should shift from focusing solely on affluent markets to addressing the problems of the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. This inclusive approach, characterized by high volume and lower margins, can be highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

### Citizen Participation
Citizens should be seen as "co-designers" of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:36]</a>. Governments can highlight key challenges (e.g., SDGs) and create incentives for collaboration between large companies, smaller businesses, and communities to address them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>. This fosters a sense of "nation building" and enhances "citizen welfare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges and Moving Forward

A major constraint for innovators is navigating regulatory hurdles, behavioral change, and stakeholder coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. Economic recessions also limit capital flows, especially for low and middle-income countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

To get closer to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), despite setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>, governments and partners need to:
*   **Be Creative and Empathetic:** Understand the constraints and priorities of local governments and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.
*   **Streamline Adoption:** Design country innovation platforms to convert global ideas into a "true pipeline of innovation" by curating solutions relevant to local needs and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.
*   **Strategic Repurposing:** Mindfully leverage existing manufacturing, supply chains, cold chain ingenuity, and blend capital in new structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.
*   **Take Risks:** Donors and governments must be willing to take more risks when investing locally to foster locally driven innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.
*   **Broaden Perspectives:** Move beyond traditional silos in the development sector and actively include diverse innovators, such as female and locally-based innovators, who might not be on traditional radars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

The crisis has revealed the significant potential of underused innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. By adopting these strategies, governments, in partnership with the international community and private sector, can advance global sustainable development and truly reduce poverty and inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.

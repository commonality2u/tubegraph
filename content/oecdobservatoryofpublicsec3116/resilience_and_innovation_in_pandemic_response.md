This article summarizes insights from an OECD session exploring how health systems responded to the COVID-19 crisis, focusing on lessons learned and future reforms. The session is part of a larger "Government After Shock" series, aiming to gather global learnings on what practices should be left behind, what should be kept, and what should be done differently after the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05"> [01:05:05]</a>. The ultimate goal is to contribute to a call to action for governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06"> [02:06:06]</a>.

## Health System Preparedness and Rapid Adaptation

The COVID-19 crisis prompted incredibly rapid changes in health systems, particularly in the use of technology, staff re-qualification and redeployment, and behavioral change communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:47"> [03:47:47]</a>.

### Latvia: A "Miracle" of Reorganization
Despite having one of the worst-funded health systems in the EU, Latvia described its response as a "miracle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00"> [05:00:00]</a>. The shock and stress led to rapid regrouping, reorganization, and effective use of existing resources, including strong epidemiological services for test and trace, and good cooperation with private service providers for testing capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:21"> [05:21:21]</a>. This highlights that people are often more [[innovation_in_response_to_crisis | innovative than institutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:33"> [06:33:33]</a>.

### Ireland: Addressing Shortages with Staff Willingness
Ireland's health system was not ready, facing a shortage of critical care beds and grappling with a new health reform program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:51"> [06:51:51]</a>. However, the willingness of staff, particularly nurses, to undertake training and support intensive surge capacity preparations was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:32"> [07:32:32]</a>. Challenges included primary care staffing shortages and difficulties recruiting for dedicated testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:14"> [08:14:14]</a>.

### Korea: Leveraging Existing Infrastructure and Past Experience
Korea's success stemmed from three key factors:
1.  **Diagnosis Capacity**: Rapidly enhanced PCR testing capacity to over 25,000 cases per day, allowing exposed and suspected patients to be tested quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:41"> [10:41:41]</a>.
2.  **Data Infrastructure**: Utilized its national health insurance system (covering 100% of the population) and advanced information infrastructure, such as the drug utilization system. This enabled clinicians to check travel history and facilitated rapid development of a mask distribution system to prevent panic buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:11"> [11:11:11]</a>.
3.  **Governance**: All relevant organizations, including local governments, were linked under a central disaster management headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:51"> [12:51:51]</a>.

These successes were built upon pre-existing systems, including the unified health insurance and information infrastructure, and crucial lessons from the MERS crisis in 2015, which led to the development of a strong crisis management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:47"> [13:47:47]</a>. The population's pre-existing habit of wearing facial masks due to pollution also played a role in mitigating spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:52"> [15:52:52]</a>. This illustrates strong [[resilience_and_agility_in_government | resilience and agility in government]].

### Sweden: Scaling Capacity and Digital Transformation
Sweden successfully scaled up its ICU capacity, doubling it and maintaining availability from the start of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:24"> [18:24:24]</a>. The crisis also prompted a "frog leap" in digitalizing the health system, delivering services through new digital ways for follow-up visits, remote monitoring, and prescription renewals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:43"> [18:43:43]</a>. Strong public trust in the health and public health systems was maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:37"> [19:37:37]</a>. The pandemic also fostered tighter collaboration within Sweden's fragmented health system, uniting stakeholders around a single goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:04"> [20:04:04]</a>.

### Israel: Proactive Protection and Digital Health Acceleration
Israel, despite a thinly stretched healthcare system, benefited from a long-standing pandemic contingency plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:10"> [24:10:10]</a>. Key aspects of their response included:
1.  **Proactive Protection**: Intensive, proactive approach to protect the elderly and high-risk groups by advising them to stay home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:46"> [24:46:46]</a>.
2.  **Mass Testing**: Early and large-scale diagnostic testing (over 80,000 PCR tests per day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:37"> [25:37:37]</a>.
3.  **Timely Care Adaptation**: Rapid adaptation of hospital care, including early understanding that ventilation was not always the best option and implementing proning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:05"> [26:05:05]</a>.
4.  **Rapid Digital Transition**: A very fast transition to online care, leveraging existing digital health infrastructure to focus on chronic disease management and proactive preventive medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:36"> [26:36:36]</a>. This represents significant [[innovation_in_response_to_crisis | innovation in response to crisis]].

## Managing the "Double Burden" of Care

A critical challenge during the pandemic was balancing COVID-19 response with the need to maintain other essential healthcare services, as neglecting non-emergency care led to increased mortality from other conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:37"> [27:37:37]</a>.

*   **Latvia**: Initially closed most planned services in spring, leading to heavy impact on accessibility, despite low COVID numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:29"> [28:29:29]</a>. In the second wave, the goal was to keep healthcare open as much as possible, reorganizing bed capacities for COVID without closing planned care, though staff shortages remain a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:25"> [29:25:25]</a>.
*   **Ireland**: Faced a significant backlog of non-acute care due to staff redeployment and self-isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:17"> [33:17:17]</a>. They utilized [[government_innovation_during_covid19 | e-health]] for telehealth and electronic prescriptions, and emphasized community support and well-being initiatives to prevent illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:41"> [33:41:41]</a>.
*   **Sweden**: Deliberately avoided a full lockdown in the first wave, aiming to maintain overall health perspectives, including keeping schools open to prevent negative health effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:11"> [36:11:11]</a>. While the first wave affected screening programs and elective surgery, the health system bounced back quickly in the second wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:36:36"> [37:36:36]</a>.
*   **Israel**: In the second wave, hospitals did not stop elective procedures, and community-focused primary healthcare and preventive medicine continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:26:26"> [41:26:26]</a>. [[innovative_responses_to_covid19_by_governments | Predictive analytics]] were used to identify high-risk patients for proactive outreach, ensuring continuity of care for chronic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:06:06"> [42:06:06]</a>.
*   **Korea**: During a high prevalence period in Daegu, the government divided care into three levels: general hospitals for severe cases, "living care centers" for low-level care, and home isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:35"> [43:35:35]</a>. Hospitals were designated for specific types of patients (COVID, other respiratory, other diseases), completely separating patient flows and preventing an increase in mortality from other diseases like myocardial infarction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:15"> [45:15:15]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Future Directions

The pandemic has highlighted that public health is a complex issue, inextricably linked to the economy, jobs, education, and transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:42:42"> [46:42:42]</a>.

### Integrating Public Health with Other Sectors
In Ireland, the health budget for public health was increased by 20%, and initiatives focused on overall well-being, including community call programs and local sporting organizations supporting vulnerable people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:21:21"> [47:21:21]</a>. The crisis has given [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | public health experts]] more influence, leading to policies more aligned with technical advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:48:48"> [49:48:48]</a>. There's a new opportunity for the health service to feel empowered and appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50:50"> [50:50:50]</a>.

Latvia hopes the crisis ends the "health versus economy" false dilemma, recognizing that effective pandemic response is tied to universal health care and addressing socio-economic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:52:52"> [51:52:52]</a>. Health system impact is only 20% of population health, with well-being, household situation, and environmental issues being critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:05"> [53:05:05]</a>.

### Accelerated Trends and New Learnings
The health crisis primarily accelerated existing trends like digitalization, patient-centeredness, and collaboration within health systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:33:33"> [55:33:33]</a>. However, it also forced a rethinking of society's dependence on timely delivery and a lack of supplies, prompting a need for better preparedness and adaptable systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:10:10"> [56:10:10]</a>. This includes stronger collaboration with civil society and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:02:02"> [58:02:02]</a>.

In Korea, the crisis initiated a re-evaluation and potential redesign of the health system towards a more public sector-dominant model, with a focus on "human security" beyond just patient safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:55:55"> [59:55:55]</a>.

Israel saw the pandemic as the "best accelerator of digital health," overcoming long-standing resistance and making digital health inseparable from healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07"> [01:03:07]</a>. The focus is now on proactive, asynchronous, and precision medicine, driven by technological advancement. There's a hopeful realization that maintaining safety margins in healthcare systems is crucial for economic stability, especially as future pandemics are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59"> [01:05:59]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[the_role_of_public_sector_innovation_in_crisis_response | public sector innovation in crisis response]] and adapting [[innovation_strategies_during_covid19_recovery | innovation strategies for recovery]].

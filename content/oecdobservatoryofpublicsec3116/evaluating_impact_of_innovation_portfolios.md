Evaluating the impact of [[innovation portfolio management | innovation portfolios]] is an emerging and complex practice, particularly for public sector innovation initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Organizations, such as the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), recognize its importance given the increasing pace of change and diversifying problems governments face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Why Evaluate Impact?

The key reason for developing a portfolio strategy is to strengthen direction towards achieving a goal, whether it's an organizational objective, national targets, or global aims like Agenda 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. For programs focused on [[innovation portfolios and systemic solutions | systemic transformation]] and missions (e.g., climate neutrality), impact is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

Benefits of a portfolio approach for evaluation include:
*   **Communicating Collective Assets:** Visualizing the strengths of the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.
*   **Bundling Results:** Collecting results from all contributing actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.
*   **Tracing System-Level Transformation:** Tracking changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.
*   **Identifying Gaps and Strengths:** Visualizing where there are weaknesses or areas to fill in the portfolio of activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.
*   **Informing Strategic Discussion:** Providing a basis for deciding where to invest resources as a group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.
*   **Tracking Movement:** Observing how activities progress across different stages or "zones" of innovation over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.

## Challenges in Evaluating Impact

Evaluating impact in [[innovation portfolios and systemic solutions | transformative change]] or mission-oriented approaches is difficult using standard models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:36">[01:42:36]</a>. It's not only about achieving specific, simple results like cutting CO2 emissions, but also about building the "muscle" for transformative change and enhancing collective learning capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>.

Key challenges include:
*   **Complexity:** The process involves many stakeholders and is often long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a>.
*   **Delimitation:** It's hard to clearly define and delimit the boundaries of these complex ecosystems for precise evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:47">[01:46:47]</a>.
*   **Unanswered Questions:** The methodology for evaluating transformative innovation programs is still largely undeveloped in research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:31">[01:45:31]</a>.
*   **Political Dimension:** The long-term and often exploratory nature of innovation means that visible results might not be immediate, which can lead to political critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:40">[01:48:40]</a>. Politicians need a "bigger stick to hold on to" from higher levels (e.g., EU or national policy) to legitimize long-term, sometimes "invisible" or "unusual" results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:33">[01:49:33]</a>.

## Approaches to Evaluation

### From the OECD (OPSI)

OPSI's initial work on [[innovation_portfolio_management | portfolio management]] has focused on clarifying what exists and for what purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. However, the next step involves transitioning the portfolio and determining its outcomes, which has been less explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

Key questions OPSI's research considers include:
*   What led to the current portfolio balance? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>
*   Who is [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | stewarding the portfolio]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
*   Are there explicit strategies and policies supporting each facet of innovation? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>
*   Is the current balance of the portfolio indicative of a temporary or long-term trend? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   Is the portfolio's balance supportive of the overall organizational remit or public purpose? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>
*   What roles do different [[innovation_ecosystems_and_portfolio_management | ecosystem actors]] play in shaping the portfolio? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>

### From Viable Cities (Sweden)

Viable Cities focuses on mission-oriented portfolios, aiming for climate neutral cities by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. They recognize the difficulty of using standard evaluation models for transformative change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:36">[01:42:36]</a>. Their "Climate City Contract" is a core tool, revised and signed yearly, which helps steward ownership and commitments to the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.

They focus on:
*   **Monitoring Transformative Change:** Not just results, but building the capacity for change and enhancing collective learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Their contracts include a strand on how to learn to evaluate in an appropriate way for mission-oriented approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:07">[01:44:07]</a>.
*   **Mobilization:** Empowering efforts of diverse actors (cities, national stakeholders, policy, behavioral changes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:28">[01:44:28]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Challenges:** Identifying specific challenge areas relevant to the mission, which often reveal policy or investment barriers rather than just technological ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a>.
*   **Openness and Transparency:** Developing a shared database or method for defining problems and challenges across portfolios to enable common understanding and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>.

### From Future by Lund (Sweden)

Future by Lund approaches evaluation with a "work in progress framework" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. They consider evaluation primarily as a process of tracking transformative change and informing strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:42">[01:45:42]</a>.

Their approach involves:
*   **Layer Model (Inspired by Vinnova):**
    *   **Layer 1 (Base Investment):** Funding from key sources (e.g., Vinnova, municipality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.
    *   **Layer 2 (Leverage Effects):** Initiation of additional projects by collaborative partners using the initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.
    *   **Layer 3 (Additional Activities):** Projects or activities initiated by actors or partners involved in Layer 2 projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>.
    *   **Layer 4 (Storytelling/Critical Events):** Qualitative tracing of critical, multi-stakeholder events that represent a system change or a step towards the strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.
*   **Proxy for Force Gathering:** Project investments serve as a proxy for showing how collaborative partners and funders are changing and growing, indicating a "gathering force" around a theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>.
*   **Process Tracking:** Focusing on *how* they achieve goals and *how* they build capacity for transformative change, rather than just isolated results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:51">[01:43:51]</a>.
*   **Developmental/Formative Evaluation:** Informing the strategic change process and continuously assessing if they need to adjust tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:20">[01:46:20]</a>. This includes establishing common vocabulary and indicators of success or change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Learning History Approach:** An experimental practice of structured reflexivity sessions or workshops where stakeholders come together to reflect on what is happening and what can be learned from their practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>. The aim is to institutionalize this within municipalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:39">[01:56:39]</a>.

> [!info] Qualitative vs. Quantitative
> There is a strong leaning towards qualitative methods for tracking impact in complex, long-term innovation portfolios, as it's difficult to delimit and quantify all aspects of system transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>.

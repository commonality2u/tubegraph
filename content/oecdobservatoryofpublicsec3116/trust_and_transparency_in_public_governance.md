The "Government Aftershock" initiative emerged from a year that forced unprecedented innovation and adaptation in government worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. This period highlighted the critical role of [[public_trust_and_governance | trust]] and transparency in effective public governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.

## The Importance of Trust
Over the past decade, the relationship between people and government has become increasingly "frayed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. A series of global shocks prior to 2020 had already shaken citizens' [[public_trust_and_governance | trust]] in government's ability to adapt and meet changing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis, however, brought into sharp focus the need for government to operate differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. As Maria Fonseca, Secretary of State of Portugal, emphasized, "[[public_trust_and_governance | Trust]] is what makes the difference between the success and the unsuccess of our measures in this time of pandemic crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. Citizens need to be able to [[trust_and_engagement_in_public_governance | trust]] in governments to feel safe and develop properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

## Communication and Transparency
[[public_trust_and_governance | Trust]] begins with effective communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. Governments adapted their communication strategies during the pandemic, making them more human-centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. This involved deliberately targeting communities that might not normally be reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a> and using innovative techniques, such as Easter Bunny costumes or engaging directly with migrant communities in Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. This human side of communication is crucial for future engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

A key aspect of transparency is for government leaders to be vulnerable, as Jerome Harvey of a UK-based charity argued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. [[building_public_trust_in_institutions | Building a trusting relationship]] requires that government leaders can admit "I don't know the answer here," and be open to experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This openness and transparency towards society contributed to an increase in [[public_trust_and_governance | trust]] during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.

## Participatory Processes and Inclusion
[[public_participation_and_trust_in_urban_governance | Participatory processes]] are essential to [[building_public_trust_in_institutions | build trust]] and ensure compliance with measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>. Ensuring everyone is involved in decision-making processes helps bring people on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. Transparency and openness in these processes improve public attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

The rapid digital transformation necessitated by the pandemic brings its own responsibilities for government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>. Human-centric regulations must accompany digitization, with data privacy, transparency, and digital rights at the core of every strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. Inclusion is paramount to ensure no one is left behind in a digital-centered world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

## Sustaining Trust and Transparency
While [[public_trust_and_governance | trust]] may have increased in many contexts during the crisis, it is important to remember that [[building_and_maintaining_public_trust | trust is built over time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. The challenge is to sustain this gain and ensure it is reflected in the way government operates, its structures, and its use of [[public_participation_and_trust_in_urban_governance | participatory approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.

Key themes for the future include:
*   **Embracing Complexity and Experimentation** Governments must continue to embrace an experimental mindset, learning from the pandemic's forced adaptations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Relationship Building** Cross-sectoral and cross-silo interactions are crucial for [[building_trust_in_public_services | building relationships]] and advancing change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
*   **Listening to Seldom Heard Voices** As Nadim from the Center for Public Impact stated, "People are not hard to reach, they're seldom heard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. Actively championing the voices of those heard least is a core principle for a reimagined government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Thinking and "Unlearning"** Governments must move away from short-term thinking and rigid ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This requires a process of "unlearning" historical assumptions and mental models that hinder systems thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory Capacities** Governments need new measures and skills for evaluating activities and the speed and consequences of decisions in real-time to prepare for future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Agile Bureaucracy** While services may have digitized, underlying bureaucracies often remained unchanged, leading to public servants doing the same work from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. True digitization requires rethinking and adapting bureaucratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   **Focus on Well-being** The mission of government should shift towards being "managers of well-being," delivering smartly and creating environments where people can feel safe and [[building_public_trust_in_institutions | trust in governments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. This requires new definitions and measures of well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

The [[impact_of_crisis_on_public_trust_and_governance | COVID-19 crisis]] has highlighted an "existential threat" and a "pivot point" for government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. It is a moment to question how to ensure that governments truly heed the lessons learned and embed them into their operations, rather than reverting to old ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. This requires a collective effort to connect, empower, and legitimize demands for [[improving_government_transparency_and_accountability | better governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.

[[Managing Innovation Portfolios | Portfolio approaches]] are recognized as an important part of recovery work, especially in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While the practice of [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolio management]] is still emerging, it offers distinct advantages and presents unique challenges compared to traditional project management, particularly in the public sector context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Key Distinctions

### Focus and Objectives
**Traditional Project Management:**
*   Designed for a world of predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   Aims to achieve clearly defined objectives and milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.
*   Often involves a strict plan where certain things need to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.
*   Success is often measured by adherence to pre-set plans and deliverables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>.

**[[innovation_portfolio_management | Innovation Portfolio Management]] in the Public Sector:**
*   Specifically focuses on [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolios]] within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   Addresses extremely complex challenges, such as climate change, requiring fundamental societal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   Deals with extreme uncertainty and complexity, where "not knowing is a reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
*   Aims to accelerate learning and the deliberate deployment of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   Focuses on a "common shared commitment" and "vision to transformation" rather than a fixed set of objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.
*   Recognizes that the destination may be unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.
*   Promotes learning by doing and adapting as things change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.
*   Seeks to manage a collection of diverse innovations simultaneously in connected ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

### Measuring Impact and Value
**Private Sector:**
*   Often has "one underlying bottom line," making direction setting clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Risk is primarily fiduciary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.

**Public Sector:**
*   "Returns of impact are notoriously difficult to measure and evaluate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   The "public value bottom line is different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.
*   Risk extends beyond fiduciary to programmatic, reputational, and other types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.
*   Value definition and legitimacy building are complex processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   Requires a "robust heuristic" to structure qualitative outcome questions and learning discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
*   Emphasizes the importance of narratives, stories, and experiences from those impacted, rather than just formal surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

## The Role of the Portfolio Manager/Steward

Unlike a traditional project manager who ensures a strict plan is followed, a portfolio manager (or "portfolio curator") is more akin to a gardener or an orchestrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>. This role involves:
*   **Editing and Connecting:** Being an editor, combining and connecting disparate initiatives, and understanding what makes sense together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>.
*   **Fostering Learning:** Creating a framework for experimentation and exploration, and supporting the discovery of relevance to specific local needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.
*   **Sense-Making:** Systematically extracting learning from the experience of many different initiatives and converting it into actionable intelligence for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
*   **Building Coherence:** Working to agree on "intent" rather than fixed objectives, acknowledging the destination is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.
*   **Resisting Gravitational Pull:** Helping to avoid the tendency to rush to immediate solutions or single approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
*   **Facilitating Cross-System Thinking:** Helping people see how different initiatives across various sectors (e.g., transport, community gardens, healthcare) relate and can be seen as "one whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.

## Challenges in Public Sector Portfolio Management

### Funding and Resources
*   **Project-centric Funding:** Public and even private money typically looks for "deliverables and projects that can be described in deliverable terms," often leading to incremental work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.
*   **Lack of Pooling Mechanisms:** Structural challenges exist in public procurement for pooling funds across multiple ministries or different systems of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion:** Rising debt and reduced resources in some sectors lead to increased demands for accountability and restriction, making it difficult to open conversations about different capital intents or new instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **Time Horizon:** [[innovation_portfolio_management | Portfolio approaches]] require a different, longer-term appetite for perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.

### Organizational Culture and Mindset
*   **Resistance to Internal Change:** Administrations often create [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation units]] to change others but have limited willingness to challenge their own ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>.
*   **Decision-Making Culture:** There's a cultural challenge in policy environments where retracting a decision is often perceived as failure rather than adaptation to changing contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
*   **Siloed Thinking:** Traditional planning tools and organizational structures often create silos, hindering the recognition of connections between different initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
*   **Identity Shift:** Organizations must shift from being "solution providers" to gardeners or orchestrators, which changes their role within a system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

### Bridging the Implementation Gap
*   There is a "huge gulf between policy commitments and then the individual innovations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.
*   [[innovation_portfolio_management | Portfolio approaches]] require sustained and systematic work to construct a frame for systemic approaches and orchestrate relationships across sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

## Solutions and Facilitating Elements

### Strategic Introduction
*   **Acknowledging Limitations:** Recognizing that traditional planning tools are not suitable for complex issues creates a space for discussion about portfolio approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Prototyping New Systems:** Finding partners willing to prototype new systems with new financial instruments while operating within current constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>.
*   **Agreeing on Intent:** Taking time to understand and think in systems and interdependencies, building a shared commitment to experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. This may take significant time (12-18 months, or even three years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

### Financial Innovation
*   **Transformational Capital:** Structuring investment vehicles to enable investment directly into the portfolio's capacity to induce effects, rather than just individual projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
*   **Pooling Funds:** Seeking technical and practical solutions for pooling funds from multiple ministries or diverse capital sources (e.g., covered recovery funds, philanthropic capital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.
*   **Budgeting for Flexibility:** Deliberately creating possibilities and spaces for flexibility within budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

### Cultural and Operational Shifts
*   **Cultivating a Learning Mindset:** Fostering a continuous learning approach as a form of "experimental experiential learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Creating a Visual Frame:** Developing visual and contextual frames that help people see connections between disparate initiatives across different domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>.
*   **Citizen Engagement:** Involving citizens and other stakeholders in monitoring and evaluation through narratives and experiences, focusing on relevance over strict representativeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
*   **Building Bridges:** Creating "labs" or neutral spaces that can bridge different organizational cultures (e.g., policy-making and design) to foster productive conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>.
*   **Rewarding Radical Collaboration:** Explicitly requiring and rewarding collaboration across internal departments, local, regional, and national levels, and with external stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Technology:** Using AI and other technologies to help identify relationships and connections across initiatives, broadening how we design and use technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.

Ultimately, [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolio management]] in the public sector is about creating a "decision space and quality of experiential intelligence and decision support" for policymakers, acknowledging that complexity is a feature, not a bug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. It supports systemic thinking and continuous adaptation to achieve societal transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

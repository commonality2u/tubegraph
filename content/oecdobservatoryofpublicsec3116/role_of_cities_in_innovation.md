Cities are emerging as crucial arenas for fostering and stewarding [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]] and driving systemic change, particularly in addressing complex challenges like climate neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. This requires intentional strategies and collaborative efforts across various stakeholders and governance levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.

## Why Cities are Key to Innovation
The increasing pace of change and diversification of problems mean there's no "one-size-fits-all" approach to public sector [[the_role_of_public_sector_in_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Governments, including local ones, are expected to handle whatever comes, making [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation portfolios]] a core practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Sweden, for example, has a devolved governmental structure with significant activity at the regional and local levels, making cities natural focal points for [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

The purpose of [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation]] in cities is broad, ranging from mission-oriented goals to enhancement, adaptive, and anticipatory approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Cities often face fragmentation and "projectification" in their efforts towards a sustainable future, highlighting the need for a holistic and systemic view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

## Case Studies from Sweden

### Viable Cities
Viable Cities is a program with the mission of achieving climate-neutral cities by 2030, aiming for a good life for all within planetary boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. It operates with a mission-oriented portfolio approach focused on impact and systems transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

*   **Funding and Structure**: The program has a budget of over 100 million euros over 12 years, funded by three Swedish government agencies: Vinnova, the Swedish Energy Agency, and Formas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. It comprises 100 member organizations representing a quadruple helix: companies, public organizations, academia, research institutes, and civil society organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   **Climate City Contract**: A key instrument is the Climate City Contract, initiated in 2019, where Swedish cities and national agencies commit to accelerating climate transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. This document assigns commitments to both national-level organizations and cities, functioning as a negotiated collaboration revised and signed yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. It stewards ownership and commitments to the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>.
*   **Transition Labs**: Viable Cities utilizes "Transition Labs" to accelerate learning for climate transition among municipalities and other stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. These labs aim to clarify common direction, leverage synergies, renew decision-making processes, and [[building_effective_innovation_communities_in_public_services | build dynamic capabilities]] for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_governments_in_fostering_innovation | Mission Drivers]]**: Viable Cities acts as a "mission driver," connecting governmental agencies and municipalities, and relating to other portfolios of needs and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. They prioritize the cities and citizens, viewing municipalities as facilitators of a wider, multi-stakeholder approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. Open calls are used to engage committed cities, including those outside Sweden, which helps focus different stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>.

### Future by Lund
Future by Lund is an [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation platform]] at the municipality of Lund, connecting companies, organizations, city departments, and universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. It operates in a multi-stakeholder environment where no single entity has sole decision-making power, emphasizing trust, negotiation, and timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.

*   **Zone Model**: Future by Lund uses a "zone model" (yellow, green, blue zones) to frame how they think about innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
    *   **Yellow Zone**: Works with high uncertainty and risk, exploring unknown problems and finding ways forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.
    *   **Green Zone**: Concepts and projects are created, connecting people, and developing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>.
    *   **Blue Zone**: Solutions become part of an organization's core business for upscaling and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.
*   **Working Principles**: The platform's success comes from its ability to facilitate a space for others to implement and create impact, often described as "impact by proxy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>. They aim to track progress by identifying gaps in their portfolio of activities, assessing if they are forward-looking enough, and understanding if activities are moving from exploratory to implementation stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.
*   **Role and Tools**: The team functions as "idea trackers" and "connectors," continuously engaging with partners to understand their needs and offering support, whether it's matching resources, initiating pre-studies, or providing strategic advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. Their neutrality and lack of ownership over specific outcomes allow them to operate in the gaps between business, city, and university sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>.

## Challenges and Approaches in City-Level Innovation
Cities face several challenges in stewarding innovation:
*   **Complexity and Fragmentation**: Innovation efforts are often fragmented across different actors and initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   **Multi-Stakeholder Environments**: Working with diverse stakeholders, each with their own logic and goals, requires building trust and understanding different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.
*   **Clarity of Purpose**: Establishing a common vocabulary and frame of reference for what constitutes an "innovation portfolio" and its purpose is foundational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Operationalization**: Moving from theoretical frameworks to practical, day-to-day work involves constant identification of needs, matching resources, and facilitating connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>.

## Stewarding Innovation at the City Level
Effective [[the_role_of_public_sector_in_innovation | public sector innovation]] requires active stewardship, especially at the system level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

*   **Portfolio of Portfolios**: A key concept emerging in this context is the "portfolio of portfolios," where efforts are aligned and connected through learning mechanisms across different actors and governance levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.
*   **Open Interfaces**: It is useful to think about "open interfaces" between portfolios to enable or facilitate connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
*   **City-Level Centrality**: Depending on the specific mission (e.g., climate neutrality in cities), the city level often becomes central to the portfolio, given its unique position to integrate various local stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Sense-Making**: A critical sense-making process is needed to understand and critically address how portfolio strategy functions in new collaborative contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. This includes asking "portfolio of what?" to consider not just projects or innovations, but also challenges, needs, and barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.

## Measuring Impact in City Innovation
Evaluating impact in complex, long-term [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]] and system transformations is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.

*   **Beyond Traditional Metrics**: Standard evaluation models often fall short when dealing with transformative change and mission-oriented approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:32">[01:42:32]</a>. It's not just about cutting CO2 emissions, but building the "muscle" for transformative change and enhancing collective learning capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>.
*   **Process Tracking**: A more appropriate approach involves tracking transformative change processes in a structured way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:42">[01:45:42]</a>. This includes:
    *   Establishing strategic direction and shared aims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:53">[01:45:53]</a>.
    *   Agreeing on appropriate indicators of success or directional progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:04">[01:46:04]</a>.
    *   Using developmental or formative evaluation to inform strategic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:20">[01:46:20]</a>.
    *   Continuously communicating progress to stakeholders to maintain engagement and allow for adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:08">[01:47:08]</a>.
*   **Learning History Approach**: One experimental practice to address evaluation is the "learning history" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>. This involves structured reflexivity sessions or workshops where stakeholders come together to reflect on what is happening and what can be learned from their practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:17">[01:56:17]</a>.

## Political and Legitimacy Aspects
Maintaining legitimacy for long-term [[the_role_of_public_sector_in_innovation | public sector innovation]] goals in cities is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:07">[01:49:07]</a>.

*   **Overarching Mandates**: Higher-level policies (e.g., from EU or national governments) provide an essential overruling mandate that city-level initiatives can point to for legitimacy, especially when local political questions fluctuate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:33">[01:49:33]</a>. This helps politicians on the local level explain broader goals to their constituents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:10">[01:50:10]</a>.
*   **Multiple Purposes**: Emphasizing that climate transition is not only about reducing carbon but also about creating better daily lives for citizens helps secure broader support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>.
*   **Common Language**: Using frameworks like the OECD's Innovation Facets Model helps create a common language to explain why different, sometimes risky, innovation activities are necessary and how they contribute to the overall portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:32">[01:53:32]</a>. This demonstrates how diverse efforts are valuable when combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:13">[01:54:13]</a>.

## [[building_networks_for_innovation | Building Networks for Innovation]] and International Collaboration
Connecting to international portfolios is vital for cities, as most [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation]] happens outside national borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>.

*   **Shared Mandates**: The mission of climate-neutral cities, for example, has no boundaries and benefits from global support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:54">[01:35:54]</a>.
*   **Direct Connections**: Direct in-person connections between national programs (e.g., Sweden and the EU) are helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:18">[01:36:18]</a>.
*   **Open Calls and Partnerships**: Using open calls helps identify interested partners globally. Collaborating with international actors like UN-Habitat, who have policy mandates and direct engagement with local governments, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Ecosystems**: Focused efforts can tap into existing national and bilateral collaborations, such as Vinnova's long-term relations in Brazil, or engaging foreign missions and embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:30">[01:38:30]</a>.
*   **Learning from Others**: Going international allows cities to learn from best practices elsewhere and adapt them to their own environment, avoiding the need to "reinvent everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>. International contexts often reduce competition, allowing for more open dialogue and faster learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

Ultimately, cities play a central role in driving [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation]] by creating environments where diverse stakeholders can connect, understand shared goals, and collectively work towards complex systemic transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:40">[01:32:40]</a>.

The future of [[behavioral_insights_in_government | behavioral science in government]] was the subject of a roundtable discussion, emphasizing its crucial role during and after crises like the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The objective was twofold: to reflect on lessons learned during the crisis and to discuss how behavioral science will influence [[Behavioral_Public_Policy | public policy]] moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The discussion also explored how behavioral science can aid governments in post-pandemic recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Current Landscape of Behavioral Science in Government

Panelists from Australia, South Africa, Qatar, France, and Lebanon offered insights into the current situation in their respective countries and the [[implementation_of_behavioral_science_in_government | implementation of behavioral science in government]] during the COVID-19 crisis.

### Geographic Overview and Behavioral Science Teams
*   **Australia:** Simon Gordon, Managing Director of the Behavioral Economics Team (BETA) in the Australian government, noted the country's fortunate position with under 100 active COVID-19 cases in a population of 25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Australia has a very active and growing community of behavioral scientists, with around a dozen teams in federal government, and teams in most state governments, universities, and the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **South Africa:** Amara Martinez, Director of Policy Research and Analysis at the Western Cape Government, highlighted that South Africa, with a population of over 59 million, was in lockdown level one with most of its economy open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The Western Cape experienced a long, flat peak, while other provinces had sharp, high peaks, straining healthcare systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Behavioral science, though new in South Africa, was pushed to the forefront due to the necessity of behavior change during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **France:** Mariam Chamach, Executive Advisor in behavioral insights for the French government, described France as being in a second lockdown, less stringent than the first, with schools open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Her team was heavily involved in clarifying complex, evolving information during the first lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Qatar and Lebanon:** Fadi Maki, founder of B4Development and Nudge Lebanon, contrasted Qatar's institutional capacity to trace and isolate with Lebanon's government disintegration, where NGOs fill the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Key insights from the region included:
    *   Risk perceptions are a crucial indicator of compliance with preventive measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
    *   Hard-handed measures were most effective when implemented fully and over a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
    *   Behavioral fatigue leads to decreased compliance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Increased Importance of Behavioral Science
A poll showed that over 60% of the audience believed the crisis made [[behavioral_insights_in_government | behavioral science in government]] more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   Amara Martinez agreed, stating that COVID-19, being fundamentally about behavior change, put [[incorporating_behavioral_science_in_government_and_industry | behavioral science]] at the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   Simon Gordon contended that [[Behavioral_Insights_for_Public_Policy | behavioral science]] was "as important as before," always being key to bringing the public into public policy and leading evidence-based policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. However, he acknowledged that the *perception* and *prevalence* of behavioral sciences have shifted, making it more clearly in the spotlight and raising expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## Lessons Learned During the Crisis

### What Worked Well
*   **Clarifying Information:** Mariam Chamach highlighted the importance of making complex, evolving information as clear as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This involves providing the right amount of information at the right time, delivered by trusted messengers and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sector Collaboration:** Simon Gordon praised the amazing level of rapid cross-sector collaboration, especially between academics and government, driven by a shared focus on combating the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.
*   **Rapid Learning and Flexibility:** Teams had to quickly adapt, moving from preferred methodological approaches (like 18-month RCTs) to providing advice in an hour, demonstrating impressive flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.
*   **Strong Ties with Researchers:** Mariam's team benefited from close networks with researchers, allowing for rapid mobilization of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

### What Needs to Change
*   **Information Overload and Cognitive Load:** Mariam noted the paradox of needing to give citizens ample information while respecting that people's bandwidths are overloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. More work is needed on using infographics and visual information effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   **Scientific Communication and Literacy:** It's crucial to improve scientific communication to make complex, uncertain findings more understandable and to help the public accept the scientific method, where findings evolve with new evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.
*   **Resource Allocation for Teams:** Mariam suggested splitting resources in behavioral science teams, with one part being responsive and agile for immediate requests, and another anticipating long-term problems and working on experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

### Shifting Focus in the New Normal
Fadi Maki observed a shift in the [[Behavioral_Public_Policy | role of behavioral science]]:
*   **Initial Phase:** Primarily focused on encouraging staying at home, self-isolation, and confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
*   **New Normal:** As economies reopen, behavioral tools now inform how to safely transition into the new normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.
*   **Facilitator Role:** Behavioral science has moved from potentially overstepping into health science's domain to becoming a facilitator for implementing expert-driven solutions, helping habits stick or desist using evidence and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

## The Future of Behavioral Science in Government

### Addressing Complex Policy Problems
Amara Martinez emphasized that the recovery phase must consider not only economic recovery but also social fabric recovery, addressing issues like mental health, well-being, dignity, food security, early childhood development, and gender-based violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. [[behavioral_science_in_environmental_policy | Behavioral science]] can be used for complex problems beyond simple nudges, such as promoting parent engagement in early childhood development or tackling gender-based violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. The goal is to mainstream behavioral science so that a "behavioral lens" is applied to all government work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

### Empirical Evidence and New Methods
While Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) are the golden standard, the crisis highlighted the lack of time and resources for extensive experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.
*   **Rapid Assessment:** Fadi Maki suggested focusing on adding experimental elements to surveys and adopting quasi-experimental methods for rapid assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>. Regular Knowledge, Attitudes, and Perceptions (KAP) surveys with experimental angles are crucial as behaviors change rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Limitations:** Amara Martinez stressed that waiting for ideal conditions limits scope and relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>. The challenge is to quickly provide evidence-based answers without losing academic rigor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Learning:** Amara suggested that the global behavioral science community should feed off each other's insights, learning from other countries' experiences to avoid reinventing the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.
*   **Multi-Pronged Approach:** Solutions often require a combination of behavioral, policy, and service delivery model redesigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

### Wishlist for Global Collaboration and Standards
Mariam Chamach provided a wishlist for the OECD and its government members to improve collaboration:
*   **Networks and Communities:** Continue supporting groups where [[behavioral_insights_in_public_administration | behavioral insights practitioners]] can exchange best practices and share common difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.
*   **"What Works" Center:** Build a resource center for best practices during crises, covering compliance to health measures, communication strategies, and trusted messengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **Expert Platforms:** Create platforms for asking questions and receiving answers from experts or practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.
*   **Evidence Labels/Indicators:** Develop a labeling or scoring system for the type of evidence supporting recommendations (e.g., based on surveys, interviews, RCTs) to set clear expectations for policymakers regarding the quality and robustness of advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>.
*   **Pre-registration of Trials:** Encourage pre-registration of trials within the BI community to assess the accuracy of intuitions and predictions about what will or will not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

### Long-Term Vision for Behavioral Science
*   **Capacity Building:** Fadi Maki foresees capacity building as the next big thing, streamlining and scaling up the use of [[behavioral_insights_in_government | behavioral science in government]] through training new generations of government officials and working with NGOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>. Academia will play a key role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   **Integration with AI and Big Data:** [[incorporating_behavioral_science_in_government_and_industry | Integrating behavioral science]] with artificial intelligence and big data will elevate its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.
*   **Ethics:** Fadi stressed the critical importance of ethical considerations, advocating for pre-registration and transparent announcement of activities to ensure ethical standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>.
*   **Understanding Human Behavior:** Simon Gordon emphasized that the crisis amplified curiosity about human behavior and the importance of empathy in understanding diverse perspectives without judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>.

## Combating Fatigue and Misinformation
### Fighting Fatigue
To combat fatigue from restrictions, several strategies were discussed:
*   **Constant Reminders:** Frequent, salient messages are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.
*   **Messenger Effect:** The credibility of the messenger is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>. Health policy workers and frontliners have seen an increase in credibility as information sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>.
*   **Harm to Others:** Communicating the potential harm to loved ones, not just oneself, has been powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>.
*   **Providing Options:** Offering people actionable choices is helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.
*   **Rapid Piloting:** Given constantly changing behaviors, quick piloting of interventions is necessary to see what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

### Tackling Misinformation and Conspiracy Theories
Mariam Chamach highlighted the significant challenge of misinformation and conspiracy theories:
*   **Scientific Literacy:** It is crucial to tackle this at its root by teaching scientific literacy in schools, including how opinions are formed and how argumentation works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>.
*   **Asymmetry of Argumentation:** There's a big asymmetry where planting a seed of doubt (e.g., vaccines are risky) requires little effort, but fighting it requires much more effort to convince people of zero risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. This is akin to Brandolini's Law, where the effort to refute wrong information is far greater than to create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.
*   **Clear Communication by Trusted Sources:** Behavioral science must spend more time explaining things clearly, using trusted sources like scientists and doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.
*   **Inoculation Theory:** Research on inoculation theory and "psychological vaccines" is being explored to build resilience against fake news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>.

## Personal Commitments Going Forward
*   **Simon Gordon (Australia):** Committed to increasing empathy, taking time to talk to people with different perspectives, and fostering more international cooperation as a lasting legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>.
*   **Fadi Maki (Qatar/Lebanon):** Will spend more time connecting with family and friends via video conference, recognizing this as the true meaning of physical distance as opposed to social distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>. He also finds working across different time zones to provide a "fresh feed of new ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
*   **Mariam Chamach (France):** Committed to connecting more with family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. Professionally, she aims to gather more insights from people "on the field" like teachers and nurses, whose pragmatic knowledge is often underrepresented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:18">[01:10:18]</a>.
*   **Amara Martinez (South Africa):** Wants to connect more with the people her team serves, understanding their behaviors and motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>. She also seeks to expand collaboration between countries in the global south, leveraging online platforms to exchange ideas and document lessons learned, fostering interdisciplinary connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.

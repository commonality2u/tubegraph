[[systems_thinking_in_innovation | System thinking]] is a critical approach for navigating complexity and uncertainty to achieve [[transformative and enhancement oriented innovation | transformative change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It moves beyond traditional problem-solving by focusing on the interconnectedness of elements within a system, rather than isolated parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This approach is essential for tackling urgent global challenges like climate change and inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Shifting from Market Fixing to Market Shaping
Traditional economic and policy frameworks often view the role of the state as merely "fixing markets" when they fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. [[systems_thinking_in_innovation | System thinking]] advocates for a more proactive stance: "market shaping" or "market co-creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This involves actively directing growth towards specific goals, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring it is more inclusive, sustainable, and innovation-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

Instead of simply de-risking private actors, public policy needs to be about sharing risks and welcoming uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>. This implies a new narrative where public organizations are seen as value-creating entities, not just gap-fillers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>.

## Missions as a Framework for Transformative Change
[[Missionoriented innovation and its role in transformative change | Mission-oriented innovation]] provides a practical way to implement market co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Missions are:
*   Bold and inspirational, fostering new thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:26">[02:29:26]</a>.
*   Clear, directed, and targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:34">[02:29:34]</a>.
*   Cross-disciplinary and cross-actor, involving public, private, and third sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:53">[02:59:53]</a>.
*   Designed to drive multiple bottom-up solutions and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:01">[02:30:01]</a>.

The framing of missions should go beyond just the innovation sector, becoming central to broader economic policy and government agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This requires confronting existing economic models and integrating directional elements into policy tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

### Challenges in Implementation
Implementing [[Missionoriented innovation and its role in transformative change | mission-oriented innovation]] faces several challenges:
*   **Siloed Structures:** Governments are often rigid, with incentive structures that discourage collaboration across departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>. Overcoming this requires bringing missions to the center of economic growth discussions, not just innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
*   **Defining Problems vs. Solutions:** Missions should pick problems, not pre-determined solutions, though many current initiatives remain focused on scientific and technological solutions rather than broader societal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.
*   **Lack of Clear Targets and Timelines:** Many "mission areas" lack specific deadlines or targets, leading to "mission washing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Traditional cost-benefit analysis and net present value are insufficient for evaluating systemic change and dynamic spillovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:24">[03:51:24]</a>. New dynamic metrics are needed to capture the broader impact and learning from failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:36">[02:58:36]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy and Culture:** Overcoming existing administrative instruments and organizational [[Organizational Habits and Futures Thinking | habits]] is crucial for adaptation and reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:38">[03:33:38]</a>.

## Key Principles and Methods
For missions to succeed, certain principles and methods are vital:
*   **Participation and Co-creation:** Actively involve diverse stakeholders, including citizens, from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:56">[02:29:56]</a>. This fosters bottom-up experimentation and ensures solutions meet real needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:01">[02:30:01]</a>.
*   **Place-Based Innovation:** Focusing on specific local environments (e.g., a street or a school) forces a systemic perspective, integrating various aspects and engaging people directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Approach:** Manage a portfolio of innovations aligned with the mission, rather than isolated projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a>.
*   **Learning Organizations:** Public organizations must embrace a culture of learning, trial, and error, investing in the internal capability to learn from both successes and failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:25">[02:09:25]</a>.
*   **Risk and Reward Sharing:** Policies should consider how to share the rewards from public investment and risk-taking, not just de-risk the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:54">[03:35:54]</a>. This includes implications for intellectual property rights and ensuring reinvestment of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:15">[03:36:15]</a>.
*   **Leadership and Relationships:** Effective [[roles_and_relationships_in_systems_change | leadership]] is needed to drive the "mission mindset" within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:06">[03:55:06]</a>. Building trusted personal [[roles_and_relationships_in_systems_change | relationships]] and mutual understanding among diverse actors is fundamental to breaking silos and fostering collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## System Thinking in Action

### Sweden: Vinnova's Place-Based Missions
Vinnova, the Swedish innovation agency, adopted a [[systems_thinking_in_innovation | system thinking]] approach for its missions, starting with mobility and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.
*   **Healthy Sustainable Mobility:** By focusing on "the street" as a system, they involved local transport authorities, companies, and school children to redesign streets for multiple outcomes beyond traffic, such as biodiversity and social life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>. Prototypes, such as wooden interventions for parking spaces, were designed for scalability and demonstrated broad value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.
*   **Healthy Sustainable Food:** The mission leveraged the existing public meal system (e.g., school food) to shift focus from just cost and hygiene to sustainability and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:43">[01:20:43]</a>. This involved co-creation with hundreds of organizations and a national call for municipalities to prototype new school food approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>.

Dan Hill from Vinnova highlights that small islands of coherence can change the whole system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:13">[01:23:13]</a>.

### Netherlands: Health Holland's Quadruple Helix Approach
Health Holland coordinates missions in health and care, aiming for longer, healthier lives and reduced health inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:02">[01:41:02]</a>. They emphasize a "quadruple helix" structure involving researchers, entrepreneurs, government, and citizens (end-users) throughout the innovation chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.

A key strategy is to "swap it around," starting with initiatives that meet needs at the local level (field labs) and then working upwards to integrate them into the broader system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:49">[01:44:49]</a>. An example is a healthcare organization for people with dementia that invited the whole village to co-create a community where residents could walk freely, enabled by technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:19">[01:45:19]</a>. This approach generates a mind shift, inspiring various actors to collaborate to fix problems together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:49">[02:14:49]</a>.

### UK: Engineering X's Global Engineering Missions
The Royal Academy of Engineering's Engineering X initiative applies engineering expertise to global challenges like safer end-of-engineered-life (e.g., disposal of ships and offshore structures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:35">[01:53:35]</a>. They facilitate [[collective_system_change_through_innovation | collective system change]] by:
*   **Convening diverse experts:** Bringing together workers' rights advocates, regulators, industry, and academics globally to understand complex issues and build collective intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:03">[01:59:03]</a>.
*   **Leveraging networks of networks:** Recognizing that no single person knows everything, but connections can link them to crucial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:34">[01:59:34]</a>.
*   **Adaptive funding:** Developing funding programs that encourage collaboration, allowing projects to adapt and incorporate new stakeholders throughout their lifecycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:50">[02:01:50]</a>.
*   **Inclusive engagement:** Actively listening to underrepresented voices to mitigate unintended consequences and ensure solutions are meaningful and impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:29">[02:03:29]</a>.

The focus is on building lasting, trusted personal [[roles_and_relationships_in_systems_change | relationships]] and a shared vision, as these are often more critical to successful innovation collaborations than just funding or intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:20">[02:05:20]</a>.

## The Way Forward
[[systems_thinking_in_government_during_crises | Systems thinking in government during crises]] and beyond is crucial for addressing pressing global challenges such as climate change, where humanity may be the last generation to make a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>. This demands new tools and methods that move beyond existing practices and are contextually aware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:37">[02:18:37]</a>. The [[Future of Government Anticipation and Systems Thinking | Future of Government Anticipation and Systems Thinking]] must embrace this holistic, purpose-led approach to drive true [[transformative and enhancement oriented innovation | transformative change]].

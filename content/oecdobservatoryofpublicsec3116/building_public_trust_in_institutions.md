This article explores the critical importance of [[Building and Maintaining Public Trust | public trust]] in institutions, particularly in the context of crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. It discusses challenges to trust and proposes strategies and tools for fostering more inclusive and responsive public services.

## The Critical Role of Public Trust

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly highlighted the crucial importance of [[Public trust and governance | public trust]] for the effectiveness of public policies, from compliance with restrictions to vaccine uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. The OECD's trust framework indicates that trust in institutions is driven by the responsiveness and reliability of services, as well as perceptions of their fairness, openness, and integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

High levels of governmental and interpersonal trust at the beginning of the pandemic correlated with higher rates of health behavior adoption and pro-social behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. Effective communication by governments—timely and clear—also led to citizens following guidelines and an increase in the perception of government performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

## Challenges to Trust in the Digital Age

Crises can lead to citizens feeling alienated or left behind, especially when public services fail to meet their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Data from a panel survey in Spain revealed that the COVID-19 crisis increased the distance between citizens and governments, as both external and internal political efficacy dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. External efficacy refers to citizens' perception of how open the political system is to their needs, while internal efficacy is their perception of their capacity to influence politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. The pandemic disproportionately affected women's political efficacy, widening the gender gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.

Societies have become more polarized during the crisis, often split by issues like vaccination status rather than traditional demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>. This polarization is exacerbated by misinformation spreading rapidly through social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>. The role of social media poses a challenge: while it offers opportunities for closeness and constant engagement, it also makes it difficult to maintain fact-based discussions, often leading to reactive policy-making based on online sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>. Digitalization, despite its benefits in service delivery, can inadvertently create a gap between citizens and government and reproduce existing inequalities, as vulnerable groups (e.g., indigenous people, the elderly) may be left out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>.

Another challenge comes from within government itself, where ministries sometimes operate in silos with competing interests, which can further fuel societal divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:55:00">[27:55:00]</a>. A survey found that 43% of participants didn't believe their government cared about them, indicating a general perception that governments were not taking the right actions or showing enough concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:00">[25:09:00]</a>.

## Strategies for [[Building Public Trust in Institutions | Building Public Trust]]

### Effective Communication: Transparency and Truth-telling
Governments that communicate with knowledge, often by working with scientists, see increased trust and improved perceptions of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>. Telling difficult truths, even when harsh, can be more effective than sugarcoating reality, as seen in countries like Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:21:00">[38:21:00]</a>. Simplifying communication and avoiding overly technical vocabulary also helps connect with the general population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:46:00">[39:46:00]</a>. This aligns with the importance of [[Trust and transparency in public governance | openness and transparency]] as drivers of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:16:00">[39:16:00]</a>.

### Focus on the Local Level and Community Trust
The local level is fundamental for [[public_participation_and_trust_in_urban_governance | building trust]] because it's where individuals, especially those not included nationally, most often participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. Local leaders and community-based policies proved effective during the pandemic in fostering compliance and vaccination efforts, as seen in Bangladesh and Sierra Leone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. Leveraging existing community trust and engagement mechanisms, rather than creating new top-down ones, is a key approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:52:00">[43:52:00]</a>.

### Inclusive Policy Making and Co-creation
To increase [[Trust and engagement in public governance | citizen participation]] and efficacy, governments must recognize the diverse ways citizens wish to engage. Some want to participate constantly, while others simply want well-functioning services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:03:00">[41:03:00]</a>. Expanding participation mechanisms and making them simple and accessible can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:56:00">[41:56:00]</a>.

"Design thinking" in policy-making involves designing processes around both the users and the providers of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:56:00">[44:56:00]</a>. By including all relevant stakeholders—such as doctors, nurses, hospital managers, and government officials in designing a new salary system—people feel heard and are more likely to support the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:41:00">[45:41:00]</a>. Once public servants experience this inclusive design process, they are "untrainable" to old methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:24:00">[46:24:00]</a>. This approach is rapidly expanding in Latvia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:37:00">[46:37:00]</a>.

### Leadership and Humility
A "humble government" is one that acknowledges what it doesn't know, recognizes this publicly, and has the humility to ask citizens and other sectors for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:00:00">[51:00:00]</a>. This shift requires leaders with different skills: flexibility, collaboration, and the ability to admit "I don't know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:15:00">[55:15:00]</a>. Stopping work in silos and fostering coordination across different government levels and with private sectors is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:35:00">[55:35:00]</a>.

### Empowering Public Servants
Governments must also empower public employees, giving them ownership and acknowledging their efforts in delivering services. [[The role of trust and leadership in public service | Public servants]] have worked tirelessly during the pandemic, continuing to deliver services despite overwhelming conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>. Applying design thinking internally can help address challenges public employees face and improve organizational performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:13:00">[58:13:00]</a>.

### Accountability and Long-term Vision
The COVID-19 crisis highlighted systemic problems that require a long-term vision beyond electoral cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:35:00">[53:35:00]</a>. This includes holding politicians accountable for decisions even after their terms end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:00:00">[59:00:00]</a>. Governments need to adapt their policy-making processes, moving away from rigid models to a more flexible approach that integrates various tools like big data analysis, ethnographic interviews, and quick surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

## Practical Tools for Engagement

*   **"One plus two plus four" facilitation method:** Before a discussion, participants think alone, then discuss in pairs, and only then engage in larger groups. This ensures everyone's opinions are heard and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **Empathy maps:** Stakeholder groups are asked to articulate what they believe others think about them. This exercise can be a "turning point" in discussions, fostering empathy and building trust by revealing misconceptions and opening dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

Ultimately, building more inclusive public policy tools and institutions not only leads to better services but also empowers citizens and strengthens [[Building trust in public services | public trust]]. This requires a continuous process of collecting and integrating feedback into service design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

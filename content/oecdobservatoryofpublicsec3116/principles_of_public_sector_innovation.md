The OECD Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] is a high-level instrument providing guidance to governments on how to steer and promote [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Developed to bridge the gap between good intentions and actual practices, it is a solution co-created by diverse countries to help apply the Declaration in distinct contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The Declaration serves as a common understanding of [[public_sector_innovation | public innovation]] and how to foster it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

Since its creation over five years ago, 43 countries have adhered to the Declaration, signifying its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The Declaration provides an integrated vision of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], moving beyond just projects, skills, or sponsorship to a holistic view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.

## Five Core Principles

The OECD Declaration outlines five key principles for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]]:

1.  **Embrace and Steer Innovation within the Public Sector** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>: This involves providing high-level sponsorship to drive [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
2.  **Encourage and Equip All Public Servants to Innovate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>: Ensuring that necessary skills and incentives are in place allows all public servants to participate in [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
3.  **Cultivate New Partnerships and Involve Different Voices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>: It is crucial to look beyond government walls, relying on the wisdom and motivation of ecosystem stakeholders and ensuring everyone has a say in how [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is created, implemented, and iterated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This emphasizes inclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
4.  **Support Exploration, Iteration, and Testing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>: This principle advocates for testing before implementing and learning from errors, allowing for risk-taking in controlled environments using robust methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
5.  **Diffuse Lessons and Share Practices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>: The Declaration stresses that there should be no monopolies of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]; it is inherently sharable and built in partnership, encouraging the sharing of experiences to learn from others and improve activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Application of Principles through the Innovation Playbook

The Innovation Playbook serves as a tool to apply these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, offering a simple journey:
1.  **Frame the challenge**: Translate problems into specific innovation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
2.  **Take stock of current standing**: Assess strengths and areas needing improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
3.  **Apply collective intelligence**: Use case studies, tools, and actions contributed by co-creators, adapting them to specific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The Playbook aims to be accessible, actionable, user-centric, adaptable, and connection-building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. It integrates with other resources from the Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]], such as the case study library and toolkit navigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Country Experiences

Several countries have adopted and applied the Declaration's principles, often utilizing the Innovation Playbook to do so:

#### Sweden
Sweden's ministry signing the Declaration provided legitimacy and mandate for the complex work of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. The Declaration aligns with Sweden's government-wide goal to be innovative and cooperative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. The Playbook has been crucial in communicating the Declaration's messages and offering practical advice on applying its principles, effectively remarketing the importance of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Sweden was the first country to translate the Playbook into a different language (Swedish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a> and organize an in-person workshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. Insights from their prototyping showed the need for materials in the local language and simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

#### Romania
For Romania, joining the Declaration was new and helped introduce the concept of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] where it was previously largely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. The Playbook has been instrumental in disseminating and explaining the Declaration, making it easier to communicate to public sector leaders and servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. It has helped raise awareness and get public administration colleagues on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Romania is developing a new platform for interactions between public servants on [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and plans to integrate the digital Playbook into this platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

#### Chile
As an OECD member, Chile views the Declaration as providing a common understanding of [[public_sector_innovation | public innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. The government lab (Laboratorio de Gobierno) in Chile, celebrating 10 years, aligns its focus with the Declaration's principles, providing technical support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Key services reflecting the principles include:
*   **Agile Consultancy Service**: Co-creates solutions based on exploration, iteration, and testing, and encourages cultivating new partnerships and involving different voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

*   **Public Innovation School**: A virtual open space launched two weeks prior to the discussion, offering structured videos on innovation topics with a flexible structure for individual learning paths, aligning with skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Public Innovation Index**: A tool created in 2019 to measure the innovation capabilities of public services, collecting data on ten capabilities including structure, legal framework, skills, digital capabilities, and openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. It provides insights into maturity levels and offers tools to fill gaps, and is being extended to other Latin American countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## Evolution of the Innovation Playbook

The Innovation Playbook has evolved from a simple Word document mockup, co-created by 12 countries, to include tools and cases based on community feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The final version was tested through sessions like the World Jambo session and translated into national languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Alongside the Playbook, a "Do It Yourself" package ensures users can adapt it to their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This package includes:
*   A tutorial video (90 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   An interactive Mural board for digital team application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   An in-person workshop version with translatable and adaptable materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   A feedback channel to gather insights on application, learnings, difficulties, and limitations for continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

The Playbook has been applied in various contexts, including interactive digital sessions, in-person workshops, and national translations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. It is not limited to internal innovation projects; it's used for dialogues between departments, organizations, and even countries (e.g., Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) to identify shared challenges and define collaborative paths forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.

The development of a new digital version of the Innovation Playbook aims to make it more interactive, updatable, and dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This new version will be engaging, playful, interactive, highlight cross-linkages, be easily updatable and manageable, accessible for all users regardless of location, and automatically produce systematized, exportable results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. Co-creation with countries like Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Luxembourg, Spain, and Sweden is driving the development of this new version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

The "Government Aftershocks" series convened a global dialogue to discuss the crisis and its revelations about the role and expectations of government, both current and future, with a particular focus on public employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This session aimed to contribute to a call for action for governments, which will be developed by the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Crisis as a Catalyst for Change
The COVID-19 crisis, alongside other disasters like the Australian bushfires in 2020, significantly shifted the understanding of public service and employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

Key revelations include:
*   **Increased Reputation and Broken Stereotypes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>: The public service's reputation increased in Slovenia as it provided anti-coronal law packages rapidly and ensured critical infrastructure functioning and economic support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. It also broke the stereotype of being rigid and incapable of quick adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. In Australia, the crisis brought the critical role of the public service into sharp focus for meeting community needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. In Ireland, there was a heightened awareness of the importance of public services and public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Similarly, globally, people understood that public employees are essential workers, not just bureaucrats defending privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **[[agility_and_transformation_in_the_public_sector | Agility and Responsiveness]]**: The public administration demonstrated its capacity to be agile and responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Remote Work at Scale**: In Slovenia, nearly 70% of civil servants shifted to remote work practically overnight, something unimaginable a month prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. A Slovenian poll found over half of civil servants reported higher engagement, efficiency, and satisfaction while teleworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Australia also found it could work remotely at scale, with productivity increasing for some roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Increased Cross-Collaboration**: Governments observed significantly increased cross-collaboration between agencies, departments, and voluntary groups to support vulnerable communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The Australian public service worked as "one APS" during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Flexible, Adaptive, and [[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | Innovative Workforce]]**: The crisis highlighted a workforce that is flexible, adaptive, and [[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | innovative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Public employees changed their work methods and utilized skills often without adequate training to address emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Developing [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | Resilience]] in Public Workforces
Building future [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | resilience]] requires several strategic shifts:

*   **Digital Transformation and Learning Organizations**: [[Digital transformation in government | Efficient use of digital technologies]] in the public sector is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Public service must become a learning organization, investing in people, their skills, and places of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   **New Skills for the Future**: Beyond digital proficiency, essential skills include critical thinking, creativity, judgment, [[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | responsive innovation]], and most importantly, the ability to continuously learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Intergenerational Cooperation**: Older civil servants in Slovenia found telework less efficient, while younger ones found it more so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Promoting coaching and mentorship for intergenerational cooperation is vital to ensure no one is left behind due to a lack of digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Soft Skills for Leaders**: Managerial and leadership skills are critical, especially learning agility, emotional intelligence, and the ability to manage people through change and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. The public service needs leaders who can influence, communicate, and bring people along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Specialists and Generalists**: Maintaining a balance of specialists (e.g., HR, project management, cyber security) and generalists with "wise counsel" is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.
*   **Employee Well-being and Mental Health**: Leaders must be visible and focus on the mental well-being and wellness of staff, recognizing the pressures of juggling work, family care, and the fear of the unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Risk Management**: Public servants demonstrated the ability to quickly manage and respond to risk, challenging the stereotype of being risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

## Opportunities and Risks for Rethinking Public Employment
The crisis presents a significant opportunity to rethink public employment, but also carries risks:

### Opportunities
*   **Permanent Shift in Work Models**: Remote work proved efficient and should not fully revert to pre-crisis models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. A balanced approach combining remote and in-office work is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
*   **New Geographic Talent Pools**: Remote work opens up new markets for talent, as staff no longer need to be in a specific location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Public Service Hubs**: Establishing public service hubs closer to where people live could reduce commuting and provide connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>. Ireland is rolling out such hubs in rural areas using state-owned properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.
*   **Public Service Mobility and "Surge Reserve"**: The crisis accelerated workforce mobility. The Australian public service mobilized staff from less critical roles to busy areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. There's an opportunity to build a "surge reserve" workforce with pre-identified skills for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Reforms**: Existing reform efforts, particularly in building managerial and leadership skills, have been accelerated by COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Strengthening One Public Service Model**: In Australia, the crisis brought different departments and agencies together, fostering a desire among senior executives to continue working more effectively as "one APS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.
*   **Investing in [[digital_transformation_in_government | Digitalization]] and High-Tech**: The public administration broadly discovered [[digital_transformation_in_government | digitalization]] and high-tech during the pandemic, which needs further strengthening and skill development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.
*   **Professional Streams**: Australia is building professional streams like human resources, data, and digital, mirroring efforts in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

### Risks and Pitfalls to Avoid
*   **Burnout and Work-Life Balance**: Remote work carries the risk of burnout and challenges work-life balance, especially for those juggling family care and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.
*   **Changing Management Culture**: Leaders need to build trust in their employees and motivate them in challenging conditions, especially as the novelty of remote work wears off and uncertainty persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.
*   **Unintended Consequences of Remote Work**:
    *   **Visibility and Promotion**: A risk that working from home could be seen as a disadvantage for promotion ("out of sight, out of mind") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
    *   **Informal Networks**: Loss of informal "coffee table" conversations where ideas spark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.
    *   **Unconscious Bias**: A risk of "re-traditionalization of roles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>.
    *   **Disproportionate Impact on Women**: Teleworking had a disproportionate impact on women due to the burden of family care, and there was a dramatic drop in reporting domestic violence as women were obliged to stay home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.
*   **Political Competition and Underinvestment**: Emergencies should not be used for political competition among parties or different levels of government, which negatively impacts effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Decades of cuts, understaffing, and high turnover failed during the pandemic, highlighting the need for political will to invest in public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.
*   **"Flexibility of Employment Contracts"**: The focus should be on "flexibilities" in terms of skills and organizational adaptation to community needs, rather than the "mantra of the past decades" which promoted flexible employment contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.
*   **Loss of Credibility**: It's crucial to change the narrative that public administration is merely a cost and to foster social recognition for public service workers and the importance of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.
*   **Ageing Workforce and Turnover Freezing**: Many countries, like Italy, have an aging public administration workforce due to years of turnover freezing, which can impact adaptability, especially concerning digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.

## Poll Results Reflection
A poll conducted during the session revealed that nearly half of respondents expect a more flexible and [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | resilient]] model of public sector employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>, and 40% foresee a more digitally savvy public sector workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>. Few anticipated new rounds of austerity measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>, and only one person believed things would return to normal with little impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. Panelists found these results unsurprising and positive, emphasizing that returning to the old ways would be the "worst case" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. They believe the future is definitely a more flexible and [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | resilient]] model, which requires a more digitally savvy workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.

## Key Learnings and Future Commitments
Panelists highlighted critical commitments for the future:
*   **"It's all about the people"**: Investing in people, ensuring the right individuals are in the right positions, and continuously supporting civil servants to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:48">[01:08:48]</a>.
*   **Telling Positive Stories**: Committed to promoting positive stories of public service achievements during the crisis to build recognition and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>.
*   **Fostering Diversity of Thought and Visible Leadership**: Identifying and developing leaders with diverse ideas, especially those who emerged during the crisis, and ensuring leaders are visible and lead by example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.
*   **Leaders' Self-Care**: Recognizing that leaders themselves need to look after their physical and mental well-being to maintain their own [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | resilience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.
*   **Preparing for Multifaceted Threats**: Acknowledging that instability can happen (e.g., climate crisis, social crises, natural disasters) and public administration must be prepared with strong structures, skilled staff, and leadership to respond to these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>.
*   **Supporting Workers' Rights**: Emphasizing that effective public administration requires regulating working conditions and allowing workers to organize unions and engage in collective bargaining, which proved a valuable tool during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:02">[01:52:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:14">[01:52:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:32">[01:52:32]</a>.

The collective understanding is that key to success lies in continued collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>, strategic orientation, and a culture of continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.

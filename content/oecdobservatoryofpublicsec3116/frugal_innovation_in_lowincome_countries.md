The concept of [[Innovation as a response to societal challenges | innovation]] in the developing world is critical for "uncovering inequality" and exploring how to promote solutions that benefit the poorest and most vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to increase poverty and drive further inequality worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, making the need for [[supporting innovation for sustainable development | supporting innovation for sustainable development]] even more pressing.

## Understanding Frugal Innovation

[[Frugal innovation]] is defined as "doing more and better for more people with less resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This approach is inspired by individuals at the [[bottomup_innovation | grassroots]] level who face challenges with limited resources and develop ingenious solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. It involves utilizing existing resources to substitute for those that are unavailable, rather than reinventing the wheel or focusing on new, expensive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

The core principles of [[frugal innovation]] include:
*   **Resource Preservation:** Making the most of what is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Affordability:** Creating highly affordable solutions for both beneficiaries and those delivering the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Inclusivity:** Reaching and empowering ingenious people who often struggle to scale their local solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

This approach is particularly relevant during crises, when there is a need to act faster, better, and cheaper for large numbers of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### Examples of Frugal Innovation in Crisis Response
During the COVID-19 pandemic, [[frugal innovation]] has been observed across various sectors:

*   **Prevention:** Maker spaces and local communities in India, for example, quickly began producing face masks using available materials, including repurposed transparency sheets, and delivering them to frontline workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Care:** Existing infrastructure has been repurposed, such as converting train compartments into mobile wards in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, and setting up pop-up hospitals in stadia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Cure:** Doctors have repurposed existing, affordable drugs like dexamethasone to effectively treat COVID-19 symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Public Services:**
    *   In Liberia, a two-way communication platform called 'mHero', initially funded for the Ebola outbreak, was repurposed to share critical COVID-19 information with frontline health workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This existing infrastructure allowed for faster and more effective response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
    *   The 'Drip Assist' innovation by Shift Labs, funded during the Ebola response, provides an IV infusion rate monitor at a tenth of the cost of typical pumps, running on a single battery, and requiring less than 10 minutes of training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This offers cheaper, more effective healthcare services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
    *   In South Africa's Western Cape, a public-private partnership enabled local manufacturers to produce textile masks, contributing to community protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
    *   Malaysia is exploring innovative solutions for vaccine cold chains in remote communities by collaborating with telecommunications companies to utilize telco towers with generators for refrigeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
    *   Pooled logistics resources, including tourist buses and vans, were used in Malaysia to transport nurses in remote areas, akin to an "Uber application" for healthcare transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Roles of Key Actors in Fostering Frugal Innovation

### The Role of Governments
[[Government innovation and adaptation | Governments]] play a crucial role in promoting [[frugal innovation]] by creating an enabling environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This involves:
*   **Nurturing and Steering:** Rather than controlling or duplicating others' activities, governments should coordinate, facilitate, and nurture innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The analogy is for governments to "steer" rather than "row" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Creation:** Governments can help establish an ecosystem where innovation thrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This includes creating opportunities like "innovation sandboxes" with funding and mentorship for local innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Platform Development:** Governments can establish digital platforms to connect diverse innovators and facilitate the selection and scaling of promising ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Examples include USAID's Million Lives Club and the Commonwealth Secretariat's platform for smaller countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   **Policy and Incentives:** Regulations, funding, and opportunities are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Governments can provide incentives and disincentives through budgets to encourage private sector participation in "nation-building" and citizen welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Societal Problems:** Governments can identify critical challenges (e.g., SDGs) and create incentives for private sector companies to collaborate on solutions that can be promoted, procured, or accelerated through regulatory sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

### The Role of the International Community and Donors
The international community, including development partners, must adapt its approach to [[supporting innovation for sustainable development | support innovation for sustainable development]]:
*   **Localization and Risk-Taking:** Donors must invest in [[bottomup_innovation | localization]] and be willing to take risks by supporting local structures that drive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This often costs less and empowers local communities to solve problems at the people and community level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   **Regional Approaches:** Investing in regional initiatives, like an ASEAN CDC, can pool resources, research, and innovation pertinent to unique regional attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
*   **Creative and Repurposed Support:** Donor partners should be creative in supporting partner countries, including leveraging past innovation investments or existing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. This includes blending capital in new structures that combine investors and grant capital to grow the funding pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
*   **User-Centered Design:** Designing support around local country contexts, understanding their constraints, and identifying innovations that make sense for their priorities is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This involves curating the best global ideas for local needs in a true partnership, empathy-driven way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Financial Constraints:** With private capital outflows from low- and middle-income countries, finding co-financing opportunities with development finance corporations and supporting social entrepreneurs with more than just grants is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### The Role of the Private Sector
[[Private sector innovation | Private sector innovation]] is vital, but traditional approaches need to evolve:
*   **Shift from "Technology Push":** Large companies historically focused on expensive, technology-driven innovation for affluent customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This needs to change towards business models with "wafer-thin margins" but high volumes, by reaching the large numbers of people with unmet needs in emerging markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.
*   **Partnerships with Startups:** Large companies can partner with agile startups that excel in early-stage ideas, leveraging the startups' innovation with the larger companies' resources for scaling, clinical trials, funding, and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine collaboration is a prime example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Poor World:** The private sector must turn its attention away from solely focusing on the problems of the rich world to address the needs of the poor world, where the majority of people reside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This can lead to highly profitable and inclusive solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
*   **Skills Development:** Private sector engagement can also address unemployment by offering upskilling and reskilling programs, ensuring that newly trained individuals are absorbed into relevant industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### The Role of Citizens
Citizens should be considered "co-designers" of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Innovators are often the people themselves living in communities facing development challenges or humanitarian crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Encouraging and guiding this local innovation to a level where it can be applied is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for [[Adaptive Innovation in Public Services | Adaptive Innovation in Public Services]]

While there is great potential, challenges remain. The COVID-19 crisis revealed that governments and partners are not doing enough to enable [[supporting innovation for sustainable development | innovation for sustainable development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. However, it has also highlighted areas for improvement:

*   **Global Outpouring of Creativity:** The crisis has spurred new ideas to face unprecedented challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Open innovation calls (e.g., by World Economic Forum, OpenIDEO) have surfaced compelling approaches for effective, frugal, and sustainable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Clearer Criteria:** Developing clear criteria, such as USAID's Global Health Innovation Index, helps evaluate and prioritize innovations with the most promise, considering health impact, demand, organizational capability, and demonstrated progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Navigating Constraints:** Innovators face significant constraints, including regulatory hurdles, behavior change, and stakeholder coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Streamlining pathways to scale and fostering better partnerships with local stakeholders are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Holistic Approach:** The crisis revealed the interconnectedness of challenges across sectors (health, economy, environment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. A holistic approach, moving beyond traditional silos, is needed for innovations in areas like mental health, environmental impact, and economic livelihoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   **Inclusivity and Diversity:** There is a global call to broaden the conversation beyond traditional innovators, encouraging local and female innovators who might not be on the international radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

Ultimately, [[frugal innovation]] holds immense potential to reduce poverty and inequalities, but it requires a fundamental shift in mindset – embracing risk-taking, fostering partnerships across sectors, and prioritizing solutions that are deeply rooted in local contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

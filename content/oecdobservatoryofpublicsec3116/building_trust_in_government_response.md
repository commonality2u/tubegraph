Building and maintaining [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust]] is crucial for effective governance, particularly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:01">[03:31:01]</a>. Norway, a society with already high [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust]], has prioritized strategies to strengthen public confidence in its response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:01">[03:36:01]</a>.

## Key Elements for Building Trust

### Communication and Transparency
[[role_of_communication_and_transparency_in_building_trust | Communication]] and [[trust_and_transparency_in_public_policy | transparency]] are identified as vital for building [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:01">[03:56:01]</a>.
Specific strategies include:
*   **Frequent Press Conferences** Central government held press conferences several times a week when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:01">[04:02:01]</a>.
*   **Targeted Communication** Press conferences were specifically directed at children, with ministers answering questions from kids digitally to reach every part of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:01">[04:11:01]</a>.
*   **Public Engagement Platforms** The Prime Minister and other ministers used platforms like Facebook for "people's question time" to answer questions from the public, which proved to be a huge success in [[building_trust_in_public_institutions | building trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:01">[04:45:01]</a>.
*   **Openness about Measures** Being transparent about the rationale behind measures, including what is certain and what is still uncertain about their effectiveness, is considered important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:01">[05:03:01]</a>.
*   **Reaching Diverse Communities** Efforts were made to reach immigrant communities who may not follow Norwegian news, by working closely with religious leaders to convey guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:01">[05:28:01]</a>.
*   **Collaboration with Health Authorities** All press conferences are held together with health professionals, ensuring decisions are based on scientific advice and openly addressing instances where advice is disregarded for other considerations (e.g., economic impact) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:01">[08:48:01]</a>. This balanced approach, openly communicated, is key to [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:01">[09:22:01]</a>.

### Coordination and Local Adaptation
Coordination across national, regional, and municipal levels is crucial for a unified and effective response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:01">[06:10:01]</a>.
*   **Multi-Ministerial Meetings** Meetings with County Governors included five national government ministers to ensure cross-sector coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:01">[06:33:01]</a>.
*   **Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups** A particular focus was placed on ensuring vulnerable children are not left behind, adapting measures to support those struggling before and during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:01">[06:49:01]</a>.
*   **Unified Guidelines with Local Authority** While national guidelines and requirements are in place, local governments (municipalities) are given the authority and means to adapt COVID-19 measures to local situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:01">[07:30:01]</a>. This flexibility helps maintain [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust]] because overly harsh or insufficient restrictions relative to local conditions can erode it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:01">[08:18:01]</a>.
*   **Support for Municipalities** The national government provides financial support and guidance to municipalities to effectively follow up on vulnerable groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:01">[11:36:01]</a>.

### Innovation and Adaptation
The crisis has accelerated innovations and new ways of working, which can contribute to [[building_trust_through_effective_public_administration | effective public administration]] and [[building_trust_in_public_institutions | public trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:01">[14:08:01]</a>.
*   **Digitalization of Services** Online consultations with health services, previously underutilized, have "exploded" during the pandemic and are expected to continue post-COVID-19 due to their efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:01">[16:53:01]</a>.
*   **Adapting Legal Frameworks** The crisis highlighted the need to quickly review and change laws (e.g., requiring physical meetings or signatures) to be technology-neutral and facilitate digitalization and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:01">[17:42:01]</a>.
*   **Culture of Innovation** Promoting a culture that encourages challenging existing ways, new ideas, and allowing for some failure is essential for innovation in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:01">[18:51:01]</a>.
*   **Seamless Services** Cooperation between municipal and national levels is crucial to ensure public services are seamless across governmental levels, as citizens care about receiving good quality service with less hassle, regardless of the provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:01">[20:38:01]</a>.

### Addressing Economic and Social Impacts
While coordination and unified response are important, a public poll indicated that addressing the negative economic impact and providing direct support to citizens were seen as the most effective roles for national governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:01">[23:03:01]</a>.
*   **Protecting Livelihoods** The impact on people's jobs and security for families is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:01">[23:36:01]</a>.
*   **Holistic Approach** It is not an "either/or" situation; measures to help businesses and individuals require underlying coordination, unified response, and [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:01">[25:57:01]</a>.
*   **Preserving Social Fabric** Ensuring that inequalities do not grow and that the "social fabric" and [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust]] binding society together are preserved is a key objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:01">[26:48:01]</a>.

## Maintaining Trust in Institutions
Despite shifts in [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust]] levels, there is high [[building_trust_in_public_institutions | trust in government institutions]] during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:25:01">[31:25:01]</a>. This is considered more important than [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust]] in individual politicians, as institutions remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:01">[31:30:01]</a>. Key factors include:
*   **Open and Accessible Society** Norway is described as a very open society where politicians are accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:01">[31:51:01]</a>.
*   **Direct Engagement** The Prime Minister and other ministers directly participate in public question times on platforms like Facebook, reducing the perceived distance between politicians and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14:01">[32:14:01]</a>.

The crisis has fostered a greater sense of shared responsibility, highlighting that everyone is "in the same boat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:01">[37:11:01]</a>. This collective feeling can be leveraged to address other significant societal challenges, such as climate change and growing inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:01">[36:31:01]</a>.

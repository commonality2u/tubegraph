Mission-oriented innovation policy (MOIP) is being increasingly adopted by public sector organizations to address complex societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The core challenge lies in operationalizing these ambitions and making missions work effectively in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Defining Mission-Oriented Innovation Policy
The OECD defines MOIP as a coordinated package of policy and regulatory measures specifically tailored to mobilize science, technology, and innovation (STI), and beyond, to address societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This package:
*   Spans several stages of the innovation cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   Uses different policy instruments, from supply-side to demand-side, and regulatory measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   Crosses different policy fields, sectors, and disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Is targeted toward ambitious, bold, concrete, and measurable goals to be met within a defined timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Key Dimensions and Challenges in Implementation
[[mission_setting_and_policy_making | Mission-oriented policies]] involve three main dimensions, each with specific challenges:

### Strategic Orientation
The primary challenge is creating a broad consensus on selected societal challenges and translating them into clear, bold objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This involves:
*   **Customizing Missions:** Defining the "right" mission, which is context-dependent in terms of scope, depth, granularity, focus, and boldness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Involvement:** Securing and balancing the involvement of diverse stakeholders, including politicians, experts, policymakers, and citizens, without diluting the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Policy Coordination
This dimension focuses on how to coordinate public and private actors across disciplinary, sectoral, and policy silos to align efforts towards common missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Key questions include:
*   **Engaging Beyond STI:** Engaging policy bodies beyond the traditional STI (science, technology, innovation) area, including sectoral ministries and regulatory bodies, which are crucial for addressing social challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Multi-level Governance:** Coordinating actors across different levels of governance, which can be complex, as seen in the Netherlands' mission-driven top sectors governance structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Policy Implementation
This is where the "rubber hits the road" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>, focusing on how to implement complementary policy and regulatory instruments to achieve agreed objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Challenges include:
*   **Connecting Instruments:** Practically connecting supply-side and demand-side instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Solution Portfolios:** Managing solution portfolios while maintaining a solution-neutral approach (picking the problem, not the solution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   [[Evaluation and metrics in missionoriented policy | Monitoring and Evaluation]]: Developing effective mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating these systemic policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### The Bright Side of Missions
Despite the challenges, [[mission_oriented_innovation_strategies_and_practices | mission-oriented innovation policies]] offer a dedicated and tailored space for collective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. They enable:
*   Co-creation of objectives and targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   Establishment of specific governance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   Design and implementation of an intentional policy mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
This systemic policy approach is developed gradually through experimentation and learning, allowing countries to start with early steps and build on existing frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Impact and Scaling in Practice

### Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)
[[Public sector adoption of mission oriented approaches | Missions]] in LMICs share characteristics with high-income countries in addressing complex challenges but differ significantly in scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Complicated vs. Complex Problems:** Missions can address complicated problems (e.g., connecting all schools worldwide to the internet via Giga initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>) or complex challenges (e.g., Family Planning 2030 mission involving technical innovations, gender norms, and family notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>).
*   **Localization and Ownership:** The degree to which a mission is localized and owned by national actors (government, civil society) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Capacity and Technology Transfer:** Missions must reflect the capabilities of the national innovation ecosystem, often requiring integral technology transfer models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Coordination Mechanisms:** Existing international development and humanitarian coordination systems need to be assessed for their fitness for purpose to advance cross-sectoral work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Morphic mimicry (mimicking external approaches without deep institutional transformation) is a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Long-term Commitment and Projectification:** A major challenge is securing long-term commitment due to fluctuating development priorities and the "projectification" of development work. This means a shift from singular implementation to investing in competing solutions to drive systemic change is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:20:14]</a>.

### CSIRO, Australia
CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, views missions as coordinated packages of projects mobilizing STI to address well-defined objectives related to societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Crowding-in Resources:** Unlike European approaches with central funding pools, CSIRO aims to crowd in existing financial and other resources from industry, government, research, and civil society to scale missions and achieve impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:36:01]</a>. This also involves balancing mission objectives with the imperative of attracting external revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:16]</a>.
*   **Scaling Challenges:** Key implementation challenges include scaling up efforts, ongoing [[evaluation_and_metrics_in_missionoriented_policy | monitoring and evaluation]], and determining when and how to intervene if programs are not delivering expected outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:40:25]</a>.
*   **Mission Examples:** Launched missions include Hydrogen Industry, Future Protein, Trusted Agrifoods, and Drought Resilience, with specific measurable objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:39:57]</a>. A "Towards Net Zero Mission" focusing on regional targets is also in planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:40:12]</a>.

### Research Council of Norway (RCN)
Norway has experience with "accelerated missions" developed bottom-up through inter-agency collaboration, like the Pilot-E scheme for electric ferries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:44:05]</a>.
*   **Scaling Up:** The concept is being scaled to new areas like healthcare, requiring adaptation to different actors, incentives, and organizational cultures (e.g., municipalities, hospitals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:46:12]</a>.
*   **Leveling Up (Whole-of-Government):** The next step is a "level up" to a whole-of-government approach for industrial transformation (e.g., reducing oil and gas dependency), which faces challenges due to a strong sectoral government structure and the need for broad political agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:48:13]</a>.
*   **Formal vs. Informal:** While small, bottom-up initiatives can bypass formal and cultural issues, scaling up involves navigating complex inter-agency differences, legal issues, and the introduction of "prestige" when ministries and politicians get involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:08:19]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Management:** RCN uses a portfolio management system to monitor and capture all relevant projects across programs and budgets related to a specific problem, allowing for a broader overview beyond specific mission programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:21:27]</a>.

### UNDP Vietnam
UNDP Vietnam's "Deep Demonstrations" initiative aims to address the "relevance gap" where current development approaches are not designed for complex, fast-moving challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Sense-Making:** A key process is iterative portfolio sense-making, which rapidly extracts insights from existing projects to understand the challenge space and identify acceleration opportunities, like the transition to a circular economy in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:56:07]</a>.
*   **Reframing Challenges:** Using a studio approach with diverse backgrounds helps reframe complex problems, such as understanding that a circular economy transition requires more than just environmental policy; it needs to change fundamental economic logics and involve multiple ministries beyond the Ministry of Environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:25:05]</a>.
*   **Movement Building:** Underestimating the need for movement-building and local engagement (e.g., through a circular economy hub) was a key learning, as local critical mass is essential for driving change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:12:14]</a>.
*   **Cross-Ministerial Coordination:** A significant challenge is bringing different government departments and ministries together around a shared mission, especially when existing incentives favor silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:28]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Portfolios:** The need for adaptive portfolios that can pivot based on unexpected learnings during implementation is crucial, but current donor and organizational mechanisms often don't allow for this flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:14:25]</a>.

### Innovation Fund Denmark
Denmark's first "real" mission-driven program focuses on green research strategy with four missions (PTX, carbon capture, agriculture and food, circular economy, plastic and textiles) funded with 100 million Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:50]</a>.
*   **Defining Impact:** A major challenge is measuring the impact of different roadmaps, especially when comparing diverse goals like greenhouse gas reduction and competitiveness for Danish companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:15:27]</a>.
*   **Agility vs. Focus:** Balancing the need to stay focused on the roadmap with the agility to adapt to a changing world is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:42]</a>.
*   **Project Termination:** Developing methods (legally and culturally) to stop underperforming projects is essential but challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:16:12]</a>.
*   **Industry Involvement:** Incentivizing greater industry involvement is crucial, as public funding alone is insufficient to solve large mission problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:32]</a>.
*   **Policy Integration:** Integrating demand-side policies (consumer behavior, regulation) with technology development is critical to ensure that innovations translate into real-world impact and are not just "fantastic technology ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:17:07]</a>.

## Future Endeavors
The OECD is launching a "Mission Action Lab" to tackle these practical challenges by working with demonstration cases and fostering a community of practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:59">[02:50:02]</a>. This initiative aims to support policymakers and stakeholders in [[public_sector_adoption_of_mission_oriented_approaches | implementing mission-oriented innovation]] and address ongoing questions related to governance, organizational management, and [[evaluation_and_metrics_in_missionoriented_policy | evaluation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:47]</a>.

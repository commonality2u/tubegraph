The public sector is increasingly grappling with complex and uncertain challenges, such as global crises and their ripple effects, which have exposed shortcomings in traditional planning methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This has highlighted a critical need for more systemic and diversified innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Shift from Predictability
Traditional planning tools, often designed for predictable environments, have proven unsuitable for addressing complex issues and the high levels of uncertainty seen during recent crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Tools like log frames, results-based management, and five-year plans quickly become outdated the moment they are finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The ingrained culture of policy-making often makes it difficult to retract decisions without it being perceived as a failure, hindering adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

## Embracing Innovation Portfolios
[[Anticipatory Innovation in the Public Sector | Innovation portfolios]] offer a more suitable approach to navigating complex challenges, particularly in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Unlike private sector portfolios, which often have a single financial bottom line, public sector portfolios deal with notoriously difficult-to-measure returns on public impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) uses an "innovation facet model" which distinguishes different purposes of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>:
*   **Directed mission-oriented innovation** on societal-level challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **[[anticipatory_innovation_and_engaging_with_the_future | Anticipatory innovation]]** involving detecting and shaping trends as they emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation** to generate bottom-up solutions through experimentation and openness to external drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation** focused on efficiencies and continuous improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Core Principles of Portfolio Approaches:
*   **Handling Uncertainty:** Portfolios are highly effective for managing extreme uncertainty driven by complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. They facilitate accelerated learning and deliberate [[innovation_tools_and_methods | deployment of innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Opening Options:** They create a space to surface and [[developing innovation proposals | open up options]] where people previously felt they had none <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This allows for system learning and the creation of new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Collective Intelligence:** The act of collectively mapping a portfolio generates insights, "aha moments," and collective intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Systemic Thinking:** A portfolio approach means working with systemic thinking to deal with complex adaptive systems challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. This involves understanding dependencies and interdependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.
*   **Learning by Doing:** It is about agreeing on an intent to learn by doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>, creating space for experimentation and discovery of local relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.
*   **Iterate and Learn:** Keeping options open is crucial for iteration and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

## Challenges in Implementation
Despite the benefits, bridging traditional planning with modern approaches faces significant hurdles:
*   **Funding Structures:** Existing funding mechanisms often require deliverables and project-based descriptions, leading to incremental work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. Money typically seeks individual projects and bankable assets, even from philanthropic or investment bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>.
*   **Lack of Pooled Funds:** Public procurement structures often lack the technical solutions for pooling funds from multiple ministries to support large-scale transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.
*   **Organizational Identity:** Embracing a portfolio approach challenges the identity of organizations as "solution providers" and shifts their role towards being "gardeners" or "orchestrators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Internal Change:** Innovation units are often created with the objective to change others, but with limited willingness to challenge their own ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.

## Strategies for Bridging the Gap
To successfully integrate modern innovation approaches with traditional public sector frameworks, several strategies are crucial:

### 1. Acknowledge and Address the Implementation Gap
There is a massive gap between policy commitments and individual innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. Systemic work is needed to connect interventions across sectors, as it doesn't happen automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.

### 2. Agree on Intent, Not Just Objectives
Instead of strict objectives, focus on a common, shared commitment and vision for transformation, acknowledging that the destination may be unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. This involves a social process of creating shared mental models that hold the organization together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.

### 3. Create Visual and Contextual Frames
Develop visual and systemic frameworks that help stakeholders see how diverse initiatives (e.g., transport, community gardens, aging population healthcare) relate within a larger context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. This deliberate work helps identify gaps and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

### 4. Build Budgets of Flexibility
Deliberately create spaces and budgets for possibility and flexibility to enable learning and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. Recognizing complexity as a feature, not a bug, can unleash greater engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

### 5. Focus on Sense-Making and Actionable Intelligence
A portfolio comes to life through systematic sense-making, extracting learning from diverse initiatives, and understanding their relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. This disciplined practice turns experiential learning into decision support and actionable intelligence for policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

### 6. Prototype New Funding Systems
Experiment with new financial instruments and funding mechanisms that support portfolio approaches, rather than individual projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. This includes using "transformational capital" where investment is placed in the portfolio's capacity to induce effects, not just individual solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.

## The Role of Innovation Stewardship
The role of a "portfolio manager" or "steward" differs significantly from a traditional project manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>. This role is more akin to a gardener or an orchestrator, who sets an initial tone and allows others to build upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. They act as an editor, combining and connecting diverse elements to achieve coherence and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>. This stewardship involves:
*   **Facilitating Dialogue:** Creating space for discussion about intent and shared understanding, rather than immediately jumping to solutions and objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
*   **Building Bridges:** In contexts where cultures clash (e.g., design and policy-making), creating "labs" or intermediate entities that act as a bridge between public administrations and citizens or other ways of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>.
*   **Focus on Relevance:** Emphasizing relevance over representativeness in evaluation. Gathering narratives and experiences from those impacted by projects offers a "warm understanding" of problems and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.

## Ecosystems and Collaboration
Complex challenges demand that governments approach transformation by [[Building networks for innovation | designing for ecosystems]] and working with a nexus of multiple actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>. This requires:
*   **[[Collaborative approaches in public sector innovation | Radical Collaboration]]:** Actively designing for and rewarding radical collaboration as an explicit requirement for joint action within and across public bodies and different decision-making levels (local, regional, national) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>.
*   **Technology for Connection:** Utilizing technology, particularly AI, to help map relationships and foster cross-ecosystem collaboration, rather than perpetuating silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.
*   **Shared Vision:** Cultivating a narrative and a shared mental model – a vision that is large, pragmatic, and relatable enough to mobilize diverse entities and create common ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.

The practice of [[Government innovation strategies | innovation portfolio management]] in the public sector is still emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, but it is essential for governments to move beyond individual projects and foster systemic change in recovery and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This involves changing decision-making patterns within organizations and investing in the social processes required for shared mental models and continuous adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

The increasing complexity of the world and the interconnectedness of problems necessitate breaking down mental and physical silos within governments and policy fields, particularly regarding anticipation and the future of technology policy [00:00:38]. The discussion centers on how technology policy should interact with other governance institutions within the public sector, various policy areas, missions, and goals, to achieve a more [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_organization_and_governance | integrated anticipatory process]] throughout government [00:01:09].

## Challenges in Technology Foresight and Governance

### Silos and Complexity
Governments have historically built silos that are now being transcended by complex modern problems [00:00:48]. This applies to substantive policy fields as well as the future of technology policy [00:00:31]. Within the science, technology, and innovation (STI) ecosystem, there has historically been less formal foresight due to the spread across multiple functions, each focused on specific roles [00:17:05]. For instance, research communities often focus on hindsight and experimentation rather than future analysis [00:17:56]. Agencies focused on commercialization emphasize immediate economic opportunities [00:18:39], and those promoting STI policy often prioritize current regulations over long-term trends [00:19:20].

### The Coleridge Dilemma
A significant challenge in governing technology is the "Coleridge Dilemma" [01:09:31]. If regulation occurs too early, the full consequences of a technology might not be apparent, risking misguided or overly restrictive policies that could constrain innovation [01:09:34]. Conversely, regulating later makes changing course expensive and difficult, as technology becomes deeply embedded in infrastructure [01:09:53]. As Lawrence Lessig famously stated, "code is law," highlighting how digital technology itself can act as a governing force [01:10:14].

### Scalability and "Blitz Scaling"
Modern innovation discourse is heavily centered on scale and scalability, particularly with "big tech" companies like Facebook, Twitter, Uber, and Airbnb that amass vast user bases rapidly [00:56:18]. This "blitz scaling" leads to rapid, often problematic, runaway consequences from a governance perspective [00:56:52]. The public sector also seeks scalable transformative solutions for grand societal challenges and missions [00:57:03]. However, this focus raises questions about framing societal problems as primarily problems of scale and the implications for power configurations [00:57:36]. Solutionism, which assumes a solution will work universally, is a central pillar of scalability [00:58:27].

### Private Sector Role and Influence
While the public sector often leads in basic research, the private sector is the forerunner in taking technology designs into practice and scaling them [01:31:44]. A challenge is ensuring that the private sector incorporates ethical and [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | anticipatory considerations]] in their development, especially when current regulations often impose fewer requirements on private companies regarding data use, unlike the public sector [01:32:12]. Engaging the private sector in [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | responsible innovation]] is crucial [01:17:30].

## Approaches to Technology Foresight and Governance

### [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory Innovation Governance]] and [[strategic_foresight_and_innovation_in_government | Strategic Foresight]]
The objective is to "use the future in the present" and work in an [[anticipatory_innovation_and_foresight | anticipatory innovative way]] [00:01:35]. This involves developing an [[anticipatory_capacity_for_governing_institutions_and_technology_policy | anticipatory capacity]] that includes both agency and an authorizing environment [00:07:06]. A well-established foresight system is crucial, leveraging tools beyond traditional scenario planning, such as emerging strategic issues methodologies and causal layered analysis [00:15:00]. This system should analyze how science, technology, and innovation interact with other trends like politics, society, and the economy, recognizing the systemic interconnections and interdependencies [00:15:54].

### [[role_of_foresight_in_policymaking | Role of Foresight]] in Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI)
In the STI ecosystem, foresight is becoming clearer, particularly in central coordinating bodies like Singapore's National Research Foundation [00:19:39]. These bodies aim to connect research, commercialization, and policy, engaging in scanning and sense-making of global trends [00:20:03]. The goal is to articulate a goal through participatory processes and the input of humanities and social scientists, leading engineers to optimize for more value-driven outcomes [01:36:12].

### Citizen Engagement and Deliberation

#### Importance of Public Participation
Involving citizens helps break silos, as citizens tend to think about future problems rather than ministerial or agency structures [00:23:37]. Public involvement is key because government cannot have a monopoly on truth and needs regular updates to its mental models and assumptions [02:12:20]. Engaging citizens complements government policymaking richly [02:13:33].

#### Structuring Citizen Processes
Effective citizen engagement requires:
*   **Equipping citizens with data and information:** This can be achieved through formats like citizen juries, where initial time is dedicated to learning from experts [01:20:25]. Citizens should also be asked what information they need [01:21:13].
*   **Careful facilitation and moderation:** The process must avoid overly technical discussions [01:21:30]. Asking oblique, non-technical questions about fears or hopes can yield rich implicit qualitative data about emerging trends [01:22:04].
*   **Recognizing diverse opinions:** It's important to record a broad range of opinions, as minority stances can point to future trends, fears, or hopes [01:23:48]. Discussions should go beyond individual interests to explore underlying values for the benefit of future society [01:24:05].
*   **Creating inclusive spaces:** Spaces should allow non-representative groups, and those with different educational backgrounds, to engage and understand the reasons for dissent [01:24:40].
*   **Deliberative capacity building:** The ultimate goal of public engagement is to build the deliberative capacity of various communities to engage in discussion, which requires mediated expertise, journalism, and multi-disciplinary education [01:33:12].

### Experimentation and Living Labs
Living labs, test beds, real-world laboratories, and sandboxes are designated experimental spaces for testing transformative technologies under real-world conditions, often with public participation [00:47:10]. They typically come with reduced regulatory burdens [00:47:37]. The focus is shifting from testing technologies in societies to testing societies around new technologies, prompting questions about what kind of society is desired [00:48:25]. This includes grappling with ethical questions around designating test populations and creating regulatory loopholes [00:48:50]. These spaces should be seen as genuine tests where outcomes might lead to rejecting certain innovations, rather than just demonstrators [00:50:21].

[[Anticipatory governance in government and technology | Tentative governance]] involves co-developing technology and regulation in tandem, aiming for better, not just lower, regulation [00:49:46].

### Defining Challenges and Standards
Governments can effectively involve the private sector by clearly defining challenges through open innovation processes and hackathons, steering creative solutions towards public policy objectives [01:37:08]. Voluntary design standards, like "safe by design" and "ethics by design," are gaining prominence as a mode of global governance [01:14:25]. These standards, though technical, embody values and are instruments of moral economy, thus requiring democratic inclusion [01:14:42].

## Principles for [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_organization_and_governance | Integrating Strategic Foresight]]
The OECD, in collaboration with experts, has articulated design principles for "upstream governance" within the innovation process [01:10:47]:
1.  **Anticipation:** Addressing deep uncertainties presented by emerging technologies [01:11:12]. Since prediction is impossible, the aim is to anticipate possible plural futures to shape engagement with innovation [01:13:34].
2.  **Inclusion:** Ensuring that diverse actors, including the public, are involved in technology production and deliberation, not just access [01:11:28].
3.  **Directionality:** Orienting innovation towards specific societal goals and missions [01:11:47].

These principles suggest that [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | anticipatory governance]] can intervene at various stages of technological development—basic research, applied, midstream, and downstream phases—through collective decision-making, participation, and setting inclusive, forward-looking agendas [01:12:18].

## Case Studies/Examples

### Singapore's Approach
Singapore's foresight system, including its Centre for Strategic Futures, is well-established, having diversified its toolkit since the late 1980s [01:14:30]. Science, technology, and innovation elements are strongly integrated into foresight, as technology is a critical source of uncertainties [01:15:12]. Foresight work examines how STI interacts with other trends like politics, society, and the economy [01:15:50]. Anticipatory work happens both at the center of government and in individual ministries, as well as in think tanks and institutes of higher learning [01:16:40]. The National Research Foundation plays a key role in integrating different aspects of STI and conducting scanning and sense-making [01:19:39]. Singapore also engages citizens through processes like "Emerging Stronger," which allows public input on pandemic recovery and societal transformation, including digital dividends [02:18:46].

### The Netherlands' Rathenau Institute
The Rathenau Institute, founded 35 years ago after the example of the US Office of Technology Assessment, supports a long-term view on the impact of science, technology, and innovation on society [02:26:36]. Their task is to identify political questions arising from new developments, anticipate societal disruptions (e.g., mass unemployment), and determine where societal deliberation is needed [02:37:35].

Examples of their work:
*   **Digital Tools at Work:** The institute writes reports for parliamentary commissions, showcasing different visions and emphasizing the values at stake [02:51:57]. They clarify what new digital tools mean for existing workplace agreements and identify stakeholders and policy options [02:59:59].
*   **Standing Committee on the Future of Digital Society:** Since 2020, this committee in the Netherlands' parliament looks further ahead (e.g., 6G instead of 5G, virtual reality instead of WhatsApp for government contact) and is supported by the institute [03:07:07].
*   **Societal Transformations (Geothermia):** For complex, uncertain problems like energy transitions, a multi-stakeholder approach is crucial [03:35:00]. The institute worked on a geothermia project where new scientific questions (e.g., chemicals needed for heat release) and political questions (e.g., who decides between province and city) arose, highlighting the need for "tentative governance" that anticipates continuous emergence of new issues [03:31:56].
*   **Human DNA Modification Dialogue:** When government and parliament were gridlocked on heritable human DNA modification, the institute facilitated a public dialogue [03:59:01]. Citizens quickly shifted the discussion from technical details to broader societal questions about values, justice, and who pays [03:45:00]. This experience underscored that citizens often ask the right questions for the future [03:57:57].

## OECD's Efforts and Future Outlook
The OECD is actively connecting the foresight community with the technology assessment and STI communities, recognizing the deep co-evolution of technology and governance [01:05:58]. The organization hosts discussions on "Technology in and for Society: Innovating Well for Inclusive Transitions," which combines interest in socio-technical transitions (e.g., energy, agri-food) with acknowledging the disruptive potential of emerging technologies [01:15:37]. The goal is to "innovate more, innovate well," focusing on people-centered technology, foresight for agenda-setting, inclusive technology development, global cooperation, and responsible innovation in the private sector [01:16:51]. This includes exploring experiments in [[anticipatory_governance_in_government_and_technology | anticipatory governance]] and the future of technology and democracy [01:17:43].

The discussion highlighted the need for governments to engage private sector startups in adopting a mindset that considers the social dimensions of scalability and [[future_oriented_governance | future-oriented governance]] from the outset of their business models and technology designs [01:38:46]. Finding a common language of "public value" can help private sector entities, including startups, demonstrate their contribution beyond profit [01:40:42].

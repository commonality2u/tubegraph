Governments today are confronted with the extraordinary pace and complexity of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It is increasingly evident that new and innovative approaches are required to address society's most significant [[challenges_faced_by_governments_that_require_innovation | problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Key Challenges Requiring Innovation

Governments must adopt innovative strategies to tackle major [[challenges_faced_by_governments_that_require_innovation | societal issues]] such as:
*   Climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Infectious diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Digital disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

## The Role of Innovation

To respond to these [[challenges_faced_by_governments_that_require_innovation | challenges]], organizations like the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) work to embed innovation at the core of governmental operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. They aim to:
*   Empower [[public_sector_challenges_and_transformations | public servants]] with new insights, tools, and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Conduct research to identify emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Collaborate with experts to offer trusted advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Transform new approaches into standard practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The work spans globally, including within and beyond OECD countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Governments are expected to face more [[challenges_faced_by_governments_that_require_innovation | challenges]] in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, but through collective effort, it is possible to anticipate and act proactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This collaborative approach supports the creation of better and more innovative policies, ultimately leading to better lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

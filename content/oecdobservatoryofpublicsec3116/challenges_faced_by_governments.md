Governments today face significant [[challenges_faced_by_governments|challenges]], primarily due to the extraordinary pace and complexity of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Key Challenges

It is increasingly clear that governments must adopt new and innovative approaches to address major societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These critical issues include:
*   Climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Infectious diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Digital disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

## Addressing the Challenges

Organizations like the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation work to position innovation as central to government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This involves:
*   Empowering [[challenges_faced_by_public_servants|public servants]] with new insights, tools, and connections to explore new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Conducting cutting-edge research to identify emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Collaborating with leading experts to offer trusted advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Working to normalize new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

These efforts span globally, both within OECD countries and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Governments are expected to encounter more [[challenges_faced_by_governments|challenges]] in the future, but through collaborative anticipation and action, it is possible to support the development of more innovative and effective policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

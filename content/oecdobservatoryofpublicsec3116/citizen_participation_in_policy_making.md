Governments face an increasingly complex world where problems extend beyond traditional silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This complexity necessitates an integrated, anticipatory process throughout government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. A key aspect of addressing these challenges is the increasing involvement of citizens in policy making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

## Rationale for Citizen Engagement
[[Public participation and trust in urban governance | Public participation]] is crucial for breaking down governmental and mental silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, as citizens do not think in terms of ministerial or agency silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. They focus on the future and their problems, which compels government officials to look beyond their departmental boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

Furthermore, governments cannot hold a monopoly on truth when dealing with complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. They possess biases and assumptions that require regular updating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. Engaging with informed citizens can richly complement government policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

## Methods and Approaches
Various methods are employed for [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | citizen participation]] in policy making:

*   **Citizen Juries:** This format involves several days of deliberation, with significant time dedicated to learning from experts (policy experts, scientists, social scientists) to equip citizens with necessary data and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>. Participants are often asked what information they need to enhance their knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:14">[01:21:14]</a>.
*   **Public Dialogues:** These are essential, especially for sensitive topics like the modification of human DNA, where governmental and parliamentary agreement is difficult to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. Such dialogues can shift the focus from technical details to broader societal questions, such as the kind of society desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.
*   **Living Labs/Test Beds:** These are designated experimental spaces to test and advance transformative technologies under real-world conditions with public participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. They can be used to test societies around new technologies and explore what kind of society is desired when certain innovations are adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>. They also facilitate co-developing technology and regulation in tandem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>.
*   **Hackathons and Open Innovation Challenges:** Governments can define clear challenges or broad themes (e.g., energy, land use) and invite creative solutions from the private sector and public, setting boundaries within which creativity can be exercised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>.
*   **Co-creation:** This involves bringing different innovation actors together for joint innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. It can take various forms, including public procurement of innovation and co-creation facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations
While beneficial, [[Citizen Participation in Anticipatory Governance | citizen participation]] in policy making faces several challenges:

*   **Equipping Citizens:** It is vital to equip citizens with the necessary data and information they might not typically have access to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>.
*   **Facilitation and Questioning:** The facilitation process must be clear, ensuring discussions avoid being technical for their own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>. Often, asking non-technical, oblique questions (e.g., about fears or hopes for the future) can elicit more meaningful qualitative data and reveal interesting trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>.
*   **Representativeness and Broadness of Opinions:** [[Citizen assemblies and representation | Citizen participation]] should not be manipulated by asking individual citizens to bypass collective advocates or averaging out opinions to create a false majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>. It is crucial to record the broadness of opinions, as a minority stance might be a crucial pointer to future issues, fears, or hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:48">[01:23:48]</a>. Spaces should be created where diverse groups, including those with less formal education, can engage and express their perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>.
*   **Future Generations and Unknown Impacts:** It is challenging to rely solely on current citizens to defend the interests of future generations, especially when the long-term interaction with new technologies is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>.
*   **Integrating Insights into Policy:** A critical question is whether insights from these citizen dialogues are genuinely taken into account in concrete policies, interventions, and innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:17">[01:41:17]</a>. Governments often prefer quantitative evidence and may hesitate to make decisions based on qualitative exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.
*   **Sustainability of Engagement:** Maintaining continuous conversations and sustained engagement in [[Role of citizen participation in innovation | co-creation efforts]] is difficult, especially when initiatives are tied to short-term project funding rather than long-term institutional vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:34">[01:29:34]</a>.
*   **Private Sector Engagement:** While the private sector is crucial for anticipating the future and deploying technology, involving them in shared long-term future planning with government officials and citizens can be difficult, particularly for startups focused on survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>. Key challenges include getting them into a mindset of considering social dimensions of scalability from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:54">[01:38:54]</a>. Incentives like "public value" propositions and innovation funds can encourage private sector participation in solutions that prioritize societal benefit over mere gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>.

## Impact on Policy and Governance
[[Democratic innovations and citizen participation | Citizen participation]] enables the development of values-driven technology by articulating goals through participatory processes and involving humanities and social scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>. It ensures that public concerns are addressed, enhances resilience, and for industry, mitigates against potential public backlash and stranded investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>. Ultimately, the goal is to build the deliberative capacity of various communities to engage constructively in political discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:12">[01:33:12]</a>.

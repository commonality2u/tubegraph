Governments play a pivotal role in achieving global climate targets, but a key question remains whether existing governance structures are adequate to deliver mission-oriented outcomes for national climate targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. While various policy instruments and commitments are in place, many nations are not on track to meet their Paris Agreement commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. Integrating mission-oriented approaches into national climate mitigation commitments could significantly enhance the seriousness with which this issue is addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>.

## Current Landscape of Climate Action

Significant progress has been made in clean energy markets, propelled by government policies and market realities. Global investment in renewables and low-carbon technologies reached $2 trillion US last year, double the amount spent on fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Approximately 40 countries have successfully decoupled emissions from GDP growth, demonstrating that climate action does not impede economic expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. A joint OECD-UNDP report further emphasizes that stronger climate action provides an economic boost, projecting a net gain of 0.2% in global GDP by 2040 and up to 13% by 2100 when avoided climate damages are considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Despite these positive developments, the momentum for climate action faces considerable risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>:
*   The pace of climate policy adoption and strengthening has slowed from 10% annually in previous years to only 1-2% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   Slower global growth, geopolitical tensions, and rising public debt are straining government budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   Government priorities are shifting, and there is pushback from some sectors, such as agriculture in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   A perception persists that climate action may reduce economic opportunities or that the net-zero transition is not investable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   Innovation, while essential, is currently insufficient to meet carbon neutrality goals, with a focus on incremental innovation and deployment of existing technologies rather than R&D for entirely new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Climate-related patent filings have decreased as a share of all patenting over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   [[Challenges in implementing missiondriven approaches | Challenges in implementing mission-driven approaches]] include the increasing politicization of climate change, making decarbonization harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   Significant disconnect remains between action on harder-to-abate sectors like agriculture, land use, and food, and the potential emissions reductions indicated by IPCC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   Weak governance, inadequate channels for science-informed policy, and insufficient public and stakeholder engagement are critical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   Short government time horizons due to election cycles lead to policy flip-flops, hindering long-term consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## The Role of Mission Governance

[[Mission governance in climate policy | Mission governance]] is proposed as a powerful tool to overcome these challenges and achieve national climate targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. It entails:

*   **Clear and Measurable Objectives**: Establishes anchor points for climate commitments within government strategic planning, prioritizing mitigation and adaptation at the highest institutional levels, guiding resource allocation, and enabling strong [[crosssectoral_and_interdisciplinary_collaboration_for_climate_policy | cross-sectoral coordination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. An example is the UK's dedicated Cabinet Committee on Climate Change, chaired by the Prime Minister, ensuring unified action across departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Capability Building**: Emphasizes strengthening the capabilities of public officials and institutions, crucial for complex climate strategies requiring technical expertise and adaptive policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Sweden's Impact Innovation Programs include an accelerator function to build public sector capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Based Decision-Making**: Integrates robust data and continuous learning into the governance process, allowing for more effective measurement of progress, understanding of impacts, and policy adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Denmark's "innomissions" explicitly integrate experimentation within mission portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Engagement**: Fosters stronger engagement by promoting transparency and equity in climate action. Meaningful involvement of diverse stakeholders (business, civil society, local communities, citizens) is essential for legitimacy and long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. New Zealand's Climate Change Commission has prioritized improving stakeholder engagement to enable greater societal contributions to net-zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

[[Role of climate councils in fostering climate action | Climate councils]] can play a key role in advising governments, grounded in evidence and science, and bridging the gap between scientific recommendations and policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. They can navigate political headwinds and ensure long-term policy consistency, staying above short electoral cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Implementing Mission Governance for Climate Policy

[[Challenges and opportunities in implementing missionoriented climate strategies | Challenges and opportunities in implementing mission-oriented climate strategies]] for climate action with a mission governance approach include:

*   **Radical Collaboration**: Systemic change requires truly interdisciplinary and collaborative approaches, but many governments are not equipped for this, leading to siloed efforts where climate policy is seen as the sole responsibility of "climate people" rather than a whole-of-government endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
*   **Public Engagement**: Consultation is often insufficient, and impacts on communities are not well-planned, risking public backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
*   **Internal Constraints**: Capacity constraints at the local level, narrow Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and siloed budgets hinder collaboration and can lead to contradictory actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Political Barriers**: The issue of energy and climate can be highly politically contested, especially near election cycles, and geopolitics can also impede progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>.
*   **Implementation Speed**: Bureaucratic inefficiencies can slow down implementation, even with high-level presidential backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:14">[01:15:14]</a>.
*   **STI Trap**: Current [[impact_and_strategic_orientation_of_innovation_missions | mission-oriented innovation policies]] often remain "innovation missions" rather than full "transition or transformative missions." They tend to be led by STI authorities and rely heavily on STI instruments (e.g., subsidies), failing to mobilize a broader policy mix (e.g., regulatory change, skill development, economic incentives) needed for systemic transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>.

To overcome these [[challenges in implementing missiondriven approaches | challenges in implementing mission-driven approaches]]:

*   **[[Integrating missionoriented approaches in government and policymaking | Integrating mission-oriented approaches]]**: Better integrate missions into climate mitigation strategies, potentially giving [[role_of_climate_councils_in_fostering_climate_action | climate councils]] a stronger role in evaluating mission readiness and stress-testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.
*   **Targeted Missions**: Develop specific, time-bound, and ambitious missions for sub-targets (e.g., "all feed from farmed fisheries shall come from sustainable sources" in Norway) rather than broad "net-zero economy" missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.
*   **Whole-of-Government Action**: Establish a [[mission_governance in climate policy | mission governance]] framework that allows for whole-of-government actions, with clear national climate targets, specific sectoral missions, and integrated mission-oriented innovation policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.
*   **Strong Anchoring**: Ensure legal and institutional arrangements for mandates, high-level bodies responsible for climate action (like the UK Cabinet Committee on Climate Change or France's General Secretariat for Ecological Planning), and dedicated mission management teams/secretariats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>.
*   **Sustained Political Support**: Design governance mechanisms to tackle issues of sustained political support across electoral cycles, as seen in Canada's political consensus on climate targets or Sweden's cross-sectoral approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
*   **Broad Policy Mix**: Ensure missions have access to a comprehensive policy mix, including legal, market-creating, regulatory, and skills development instruments, to drive necessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>.
*   **Experimentation and Flexibility**: Integrate experimentation and flexibility, which are currently lacking in many climate mitigation reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.
*   **Investment and Confidence**: Ensure long-term financial commitment and build investor confidence to crowdfund private investment systematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>.
*   **Evolving Mission Leadership**:
    *   **Gradual Broadening**: Missions can broaden and strengthen over time by learning and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>.
    *   **Transfer of Leadership**: Mission leadership can transfer from STI authorities to "challenge owners" (e.g., environment, transport ministries), though this involves political turf issues and budget competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>.
    *   **Dedicated Agencies**: Missions could be led by dedicated mission agencies reporting to multiple ministries, like Norway's Research Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a>.
    *   **Elevating Missions**: Missions could be led by central government bodies (e.g., Prime Minister's Office, powerful transition committees) for broader climate agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:12">[01:39:12]</a>.
    *   **Regional/Local Missions**: Operating missions at regional or local levels ("micro missions") can alleviate governance [[challenges in implementing missiondriven approaches | challenges in implementing mission-driven approaches]] and ensure stronger stakeholder engagement, as seen with city climate contracts in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:28">[01:40:28]</a>.

Overall, the integration of [[climate_and_environmental_missions_in_the_european_union | climate and environmental missions in the European Union]] into national frameworks, coupled with robust mission governance, can significantly enhance the ability of governments to deliver effective, equitable, and sustained climate mitigation outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. The OECD Mission Action Lab is actively working to support governments in the implementation and delivery of these missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

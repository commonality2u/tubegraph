**Systems Change and Collaboration** are increasingly recognized as crucial for addressing complex challenges, particularly within the public sector and in the context of innovation. The traditional "layered approach" to policy and innovation projects often fails to foster a systematic understanding of collective efforts and their outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A more integrated and [[collaboration_and_peer_support_in_innovation | collaborative approach]] is needed to achieve desired societal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## The Need for Portfolio Approaches

Public sector organizations constantly innovate to improve services, capture emerging possibilities, solve problems, and respond to environmental and technological changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This means they inherently possess an innovation portfolio, whether intentional or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This portfolio includes a mixture of mission-oriented, enhancement-oriented, adaptive, and anticipatory innovation projects and programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The challenge lies in managing these diverse types of innovation effectively and systemically, as they cannot all be managed in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

Traditional portfolio approaches often focus on initial sense-making and stewardship of projects, with less attention paid to the organizational supporting structures, evaluation, or monitoring needed for ongoing function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The goal is to understand how different innovations can coexist effectively within the same portfolio, creating synergies rather than a "big mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Perspectives on Systems Change and Collaboration

### Vinnova (Swedish Government Innovation Agency)

Dan Hill, Strategic Director of Design at Vinnova, highlights that mission-oriented innovation is not just about target setting but about action and doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. With existing targets like the UN SDGs and Paris 1.5, the focus should be on how to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. This involves collapsing policy and delivery, tightening their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

Vinnova's approach to [[public_sector_innovation_and_collaboration | public sector innovation and collaboration]] involves:
*   **Co-design and Participation:** Engaging 500-600 different organizations, including citizens and school kids, in workshops to develop "systems canvases" and prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This helps align top-down and bottom-up activities, fostering cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral, and multi-level relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
*   **Focus on Systemic Layers:** Missions break down actions into specific and general components, where general components enable scaling across an entire country or system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. This is analogous to how smartphones or the internet allow diversity (apps, users) on consistent underlying stacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
*   **Place-Based Delivery:** Identifying "objects" like streets, schools, farms, or forests as complex systems around which a portfolio approach can be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. For example, a "street mission" aims to transform every street in Sweden into a healthy, systemic environment, aligning existing projects and investments under a mission umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
*   **Redefining the Agency's Role:** The agency acts as a "glue," facilitating [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaboration]] across national, local, and regional levels, and between public and private sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. It's about engagement on the ground, not just distant funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

### Climate-KIC (EU-funded Innovation Agency)

Emma Joy, Strategic Advisor at Climate-KIC, emphasizes the need for a portfolio approach to address the climate emergency, as incremental innovation is insufficient for the necessary "step change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. Climate-KIC moved from grant-funding single-point innovation to a more deliberately transformative, demand-driven approach that applies innovation in systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

Key aspects of their portfolio approach:
*   **Composition and Sense-Making:** Deliberate choices are made about work, moving from activity-by-activity decisions to those based on the sum of the whole, including interactions and complementarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. Sense-making is the activity of understanding what is being learned from external activities to inform next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Uncertainty:** The portfolio approach provides a spread of options to respond to challenges with high levels of uncertainty, acknowledging that not all information will be available for decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.
*   **Diversity of Innovation:** Recognizing innovation across various mechanisms, not just technology, but also business models, citizen engagement, policy, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
*   **[[collaboration_and_communication_innovations | Collective Intelligence]]**: Decisions on portfolio review and new activities are made using a consensus model, bringing together diverse colleagues from different parts of the organization with varied expertise and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. This helps address inherent biases and broadens perspectives, especially important in complex, multi-system challenges like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
*   **"A Good Project Isn't Enough"**: Projects are evaluated not just on individual merit but on their fit, complementarity, or ability to fill a gap within the broader portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>.
*   **Organizational Change:** Implementing the portfolio approach leads to significant organizational change, shifting behaviors, culture, and business-as-usual processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

### Sitra Lab (Finnish Futures Fund)

Mikkel It's a fella from Sitra Lab emphasizes their role as a facilitator of change, supporting other organizations in building capabilities around innovation portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. They recognize that innovation portfolio management is a new field, requiring [[collaboration_and_peer_support_in_innovation | bringing people together]] to build understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

Sitra's approach to [[collective_system_change | collective system change]] involves:
*   **Addressing Wicked Problems:** Acknowledging that global challenges like climate change are "wicked problems" that cannot be solved by traditional management approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>. These problems require bringing together ecosystems to explore solutions through experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.
*   **Shifting Focus:** Moving from organization-centric, team-based approaches to [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | fostering transformation]] in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.
*   **Projects as Experiments:** Projects are seen not as flat means of executing solutions but as experimental means of learning about and tackling problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.
*   **Time Span Perspective:** Considering the time span needed to achieve transformation when framing a portfolio, which then informs projects, budgets, and planning cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>.
*   **Integrated Approaches:** Building capabilities related to innovation portfolios requires integrating sense-making, portfolio composition (for synergies), and designing for impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>.
*   **Sitra's Role as Facilitator:** Operating across different sectors (government, municipalities, private sector), across time scales, and serving as a platform for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>.

## Key Challenges and Requirements for Implementation

### Dealing with Power and Vested Interests
When seeking to bring about [[collective_system_change | systems change]], organizations must acknowledge and not attempt to bypass actors or institutions with power and vested interests in current systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>. By framing problems around "reality" (e.g., the street as an object of collaboration) rather than existing organizational silos, multiple stakeholders can be brought into the same discussion, allowing for a more open and democratic process where power structures are visible and debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:48">[01:12:48]</a>. This also involves working with "challenge owners" and understanding the biases they bring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.

### Organizational Change for [[collaborative_approaches_in_public_sector_innovation | Collaborative Approaches]]
A successful portfolio approach often necessitates radical organizational change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. However, this change should not be the starting point, as it can generate immediate pushback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>. Instead, it begins with "the Coalition of the Willing," gathering people supportive of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>. The focus should shift from viewing the organization as static to a continuous process of "organizing," creating spaces for constant learning and adaptation based on experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. Projects themselves can serve as a means to sketch out how the organization needs to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>.

### Leadership for Experimentation
Traditional leadership models, which emphasize control and knowing the "right answer," are not suitable for an experimental, portfolio-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. A new type of leadership is emerging that enables transformation by allowing for uncertainty, giving space to diverse perspectives, and recognizing that leadership is a distributed ability within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. This "systems leadership" focuses on collaborating to achieve transformation, rather than being dependent on "hero leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>. It requires leaders to be comfortable with discomfort and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>.

## Moving Forward

The field of innovation portfolio management is still new and emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:42">[01:22:42]</a>. Organizations like the OECD are developing tools, such as the innovation portfolio assessment tool, to help public sector entities manage their portfolios more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. The goal is to move beyond single-point interventions or layered approaches towards concerted efforts aligned with a clear purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a>. This will be crucial for [[government_innovation_and_collaboration_postpandemic | government innovation and collaboration post-pandemic]], enabling a bounce forward from crisis to a more effective and integrated public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a>.

Bottom-up innovation, often synonymous with [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]], centers around a [[discovery_process_in_innovation | discovery process]] rather than predefined goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It involves exploring new ideas and uncovering what is possible, which is crucial for the emergence of novel concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Characteristics
Typically, innovation is viewed within existing systems or paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, bottom-up innovation involves exploring new ideas on the ground, which may become useful for current government services or even challenge existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

It requires giving people the allowance and room to explore new ideas from a bottom-up perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Those working closest to citizens can draw upon signals from their lives, innovating or experimenting based on feedback from the system itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Outcomes
Bottom-up innovation can lead to both [[transformative_and_enhancement_oriented_innovation | transformative]] and [[transformative_and_enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Examples
Various [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovations]] have emerged in different countries through this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

*   **Canada**: Individuals have developed apps alongside their regular work to make the regulatory system more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These apps simplify understanding regulations, such as what applies when establishing a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The focus shifts from merely simplifying regulation to making it understandable and usable for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

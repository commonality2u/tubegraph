Effective [[leadership and innovation during covid19|leadership]] and robust teamwork are vital for navigating crises and building a future-fit public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This involves fostering innovation, adaptation, strategic foresight, and co-creation to shape a better future for governments, societies, and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## The Power of Teamwork
Petra Majdič, a former cross-country skiing champion and current businesswoman, exemplifies the power of teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:32">[02:18:32]</a>. Despite skiing being an individual sport, she always emphasized "we and us" over "me and I" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:01">[03:00:01]</a>. She never felt like a leader but rather "one of them, part of my team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:14">[03:16:14]</a>. Her approach was to build a dependable team based on mutual trust and reliance, which was always rewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

A critical example occurred at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, where she fell into a 4.5-meter ditch during warm-up, sustaining five broken ribs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. Her immediate thought was that it was over, but her team prevented her from collapsing, kept her warm, prepared new skis, and, most importantly, motivated her to believe she could still win a medal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. She attributed her success to them, concluding that "the team is really the most important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This message resonated with the entire nation of Slovenia, which rallied behind her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

## [[Adapting to crisis with innovative approaches|Innovation]] and Adaptation
Innovation and adaptation are crucial, not just in sports but in business and public sector response to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Majdič, coming from a small country like Slovenia with fewer resources than larger nations like Norway or Finland, was "forced to find innovative ways to get similar training conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Her team's decision to break from the traditional four basic colors of racing suits, creating a unique and highly visible design, not only gained attention but also attracted new sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. This experience taught her that "dare to be different is not a handicap, but it's an opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

Children, acting as "human chameleons," demonstrate natural adaptability, fearlessly transforming from knights to unicorns to doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. Adults, however, often become afraid of failing, losing their flexible and innovative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Majdič's sport career instilled in her the need to be adaptive, which helped her business career weather the COVID-19 crisis, as her team was "used to always act differently, innovatively," and "never take status quo for granted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

## [[Role of Government in Crisis Response|Government]] Challenges and Lessons Learned
The COVID-19 pandemic presented significant challenges for governments worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Bold and decisive responses were essential in supporting businesses, households, and saving lives, with public support in OECD countries reaching 27% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. The [[the_role_of_data_in_crisis_management_and_resilience_building|economic recovery]] is underway, supported by policy measures, rapid vaccine development, and accelerating digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. However, the recovery remains uneven, and new outbreaks are a significant risk, necessitating continued efforts for global vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša noted that some countries were well-prepared for the pandemic due to past experiences or adherence to World Health Organization recommendations, while others, like Slovenia, were not and struggled with responses due to empty stocks of protective equipment and strained healthcare systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. He highlighted initial lack of [[international_collaboration_in_crisis_management|European-level coordination]], which evolved into a "success story" in later phases, particularly with recovery funds and vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### The Role of Flexibility and Data
Janša stressed the importance of preparedness and flexibility in facing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Countries with more flexible systems, allowing governments to enact measures overnight, showed more successful initial responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. He also emphasized that better data accessibility, like having all data online and coordinated across the EU or OECD, would have significantly improved response times and targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The need for [[crisis_management and future preparedness|future preparedness]] is paramount, especially considering potential compounding crises like a pandemic combined with a serious cyberattack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Public Trust and [[effective communication and citizen trust in crisis|Scientific Credibility]]
Public confidence in government's ability to face complex challenges is somewhat balanced, with a slight majority leaning towards optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. However, a significant negative surprise during the pandemic was the "stress into science," with lower trust levels in Central and Eastern Europe compared to Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This lack of trust is a problem when making decisions, especially for issues like climate change, where innovation and investment in clean technologies are crucial long-term solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

## [[Role of systems thinking in crisis management|Future-Fit Public Sector]]
Marco Ongaro, Director General of the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA), highlighted that "what matters really is people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. People drive change, reorganization, and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. He noted how previously "invisible" professions—nurses, supermarket clerks, truck drivers, trash collectors—became "heroes" during the pandemic, providing essential services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This underscores the importance of [[effective communication and citizen trust in crisis|inclusion]], ensuring the voices of all people are heard, potentially through citizens' panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

Ongaro, with his background in private sector digital transformation, emphasized that technology is merely an "enabler"; its effectiveness depends on people using it correctly and with the right mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. He advocates for fostering a culture of continuous education and lifelong learning within public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

Comparing the fast-moving COVID-19 crisis to the longer-term climate change crisis, Ongaro noted that while immediate crises demand quick, adaptable leadership, long-term challenges require strategic foresight, planning, and inter-sectoral partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Both, however, benefit from bringing in the right people with the necessary skills and a flexible mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

There is a push for greater [[crossagency_collaboration_in_crisis_management|cooperation]] and knowledge sharing between EU countries, as well as between public and private sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. The European Union has a "huge treasure" of diverse practices and solutions within its member states, which is not yet fully exploited due to bureaucratic obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. The goal is to lower barriers between public and private sectors, recruit based on adaptability rather than just rote knowledge, and empower people to improve processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. This requires continuous effort to build platforms for knowledge sharing and joint initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

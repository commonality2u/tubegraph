Experimental approaches are fundamental to [[innovation_in_public_administration | public sector innovation]], providing a "safe space" for governments to exchange ideas and learn in a protected environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This methodology, particularly exemplified by initiatives like the Innovation Incubator, allows for testing and adjusting programs while in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

## The Innovation Incubator Model
The Innovation Incubator serves as an experimental initiative itself, having proved beneficial for participating countries through its global community reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This first edition aims to bring value to projects by setting up a safe space for teams to work across borders and learn together, accumulating shared knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

A global exploration of existing public sector incubators and accelerators identified that while the public sector has unique specificities compared to the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, international borders still hinder government collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. This led to the development of a government-to-government Innovation Incubator model that promotes cross-border collaboration among governments facing similar [[Innovation in public administration | innovation challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## Principles of Experimentation
The program's value proposition includes a peer learning process, expert insights, recognition for government teams, and long-term support to foster close relationships and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. The iterative nature of this process generates knowledge used to improve the program as it runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

> "Failing and failure is really an essential part of any journey, and of course of an innovation journey, that without failure there is no learning, and if there is no learning then there's not no innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. - Lara Salinas

The approach involves:
*   **Starting from Barriers:** Identifying and tackling barriers to innovation and collaboration at organizational, infrastructural, and institutional levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
*   **Scaling Impact:** Scaling the impact of innovations, not just through replication of products, but by sharing the underlying ideas and thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Diversifying Innovation:** Adapting and diversifying innovations to fit different contexts, populations, demographics, and landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Based Approach:** Solutions are tested and refined through prototypes and pilots before full-scale implementation, ensuring effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Critical Friend:** The Innovation Incubator is designed to be a "critical friend," a safe space for learning and trying things that do not have guaranteed success from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

## Challenges and Solutions
The program involves "challenge owners" and "solution providers" working together on specific [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | innovation challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This collaborative model, which includes a cohort-based learning track for broader participation, aims to address complex issues where clear answers or preset solutions may not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>.

Examples of challenges include:
*   Promoting broader and more equitable digital participation (Brazil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   Engaging the general public and public actors in common data spaces to promote [[evidence-based policymaking | evidence-based policies]] (France) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   Establishing a collaborative, cross-departmental, and inclusive culture for AI project management (Italy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   Improving accessibility to public services for people in vulnerable situations and at risk of exclusion (Spain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

These real-world challenges drive the experimental process, leveraging collective intelligence, and fostering continuous improvement based on feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

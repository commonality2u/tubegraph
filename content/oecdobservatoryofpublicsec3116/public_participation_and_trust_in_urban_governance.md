Cities have been at the forefront of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, acting not only to contain the virus but also to coordinate services and prioritize resident well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This period has highlighted the critical role of innovation in rebuilding cities, focusing on digitalization, green transition, and the renewed social contract between cities and urban residents regarding [[public_trust_and_governance | trust and public participation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Cities in the Post-COVID-19 Era

The pandemic exacerbated existing structural inequalities and issues faced by cities, such as housing affordability, traffic congestion, air pollution, urban safety, and spatial segregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. However, it also accelerated ongoing trends and acted as a magnifying glass, urging local leaders to accelerate action on various fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This situation is not new, as past pandemics have historically triggered rethinking about cities and new urban paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:09]</a>.

A significant shift observed is the increased reliance on digitalization, which allowed for the substitution of physical proximity with digital proximity through online education, telemedicine, e-commerce, and particularly telework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This digital transformation, though not always present in infrastructure, saw rapid adoption in months what might have otherwise taken a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

## Innovation in Urban Governance

Innovation is seen as essential not only technologically and digitally but also for triggering better local public policies, planning, investment strategies, and system thinking at the local level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Mayors and city governments are at the forefront of this paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

### Key Aspects of Innovation

*   **Accelerated Action**: Cities demonstrated incredible pace in responding to the pandemic, with 95% of local authority staff in London working from home within days of the first lockdown, and vulnerability hubs being set up rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.
*   **Data Utilization**: Cities began using data in new ways, such as modeling newly vulnerable populations who had no prior contact with city government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.
*   **New Delivery Models**: Significant innovation was observed in city governments working with the voluntary sector to develop radical new delivery models for community needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.
*   **Challenging the Status Quo**: The crisis made many previously "impossible" initiatives possible, such as distance education, and highlighted the ability to make decisions without lengthy strategy documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Opportunities for Innovation

A major challenge for innovation in large organizations is the fear of failure, which often prevents trying new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:42:00">[26:42:00]</a>. In Helsingborg, Sweden, efforts have been made to tackle this fear structurally, culturally, and through capability building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:47:00">[27:47:00]</a>. This includes creating a system for employees to easily test ideas, fostering collective learning from mistakes, and even instituting an "internal award for the fail of the year" to signal that mistakes are expected and valuable for true innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>.

### Data and Coordination

Effective urban responses require fixing basic data issues. For example, in London, sharing data across 33 boroughs to identify vulnerable children eligible for free school meals was hindered by the complexity of 528 potential data-sharing relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>. This highlights the need for secure, ethical, and legal data access for coordinated action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:19:00">[22:19:00]</a>.

Collaboration between national and local governments is also crucial. National initiatives often fail or create burdens for local governments when solutions are not co-designed with people on the ground who understand local realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>.

## [[Public trust and governance | Trust and Public Participation]]

A key aspect of building back better is the renewed social contract between cities and urban residents, which is deeply rooted in [[public_trust_and_governance | trust and public participation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Political Imagination and Defining Desired Societies

Innovation in urban governance also involves "political imagination," which defines the kind of societies cities want to become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>. This means creating participatory practices and collaboration not just for specific projects but to redefine how people want to live, move, and be healthy together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a>.

The process of crowdsourcing the Mexico City constitution, for instance, involved surveying over 31,000 people to understand their vision for the city's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:51:00">[34:51:00]</a>. This revealed a surprising prevalence of apocalyptic scenarios, emphasizing the need to cultivate a positive future imagination among citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:16:00">[35:16:00]</a>.

### Beyond Objective Data

While objective, data-driven strategies are crucial, urban governance also needs to consider subjective data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:27:00">[55:27:00]</a>. The perception of a city and society, as well as its "intangible infrastructure" and "symbolic infrastructure," significantly impact reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:32:00">[55:32:00]</a>. For example, traffic issues are not just about infrastructure but also the cultural idea of a car as an object of desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:08:00">[57:08:00]</a>. Therefore, experimental, open-ended cultural probes are necessary to complement data-driven approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:25:00">[57:25:00]</a>.

### Importance of Civic Spaces and Community Ties

The pandemic highlighted the interdependency of communities and societies, where the "weakest link" affects the whole system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. Strong horizontal ties between citizens, supported and promoted by government, are essential for activating human talent and potential during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. This requires fostering civic spaces and recognizing that governance is not solely about governments, but a shared responsibility with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>.

### Multilateralism and City-to-City Learning

International cooperation and city-to-city peer learning are vital. Mayors and city managers find tremendous value in talking to one another, understanding shared challenges, and collaborating on solutions, especially when higher levels of government lack coordination or have disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>. Networks like the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative facilitate this dialogue, sharing best practices and encouraging replication of successful innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The crisis has reinforced the importance of public institutions, from health systems to governments, and the need to fortify them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>. The focus should shift from optimizing for efficiency to optimizing for public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

Post-pandemic, there's a strong commitment to prevent a return to "normal" in certain areas. For example, Mexico City's congress recently passed mobility as a human right, a global first, accelerated by the pandemic's focus on essential movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>. Similarly, the rapid acceptance of pedestrian streets, once met with resistance, highlights how experiencing these changes can lead to widespread conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. These "experimental probes" can help citizens become convinced of new urban realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

The ability to innovate and act quickly, as demonstrated during the crisis, must be locked in for the future. This involves a combination of big-picture thinking, political imagination, and ensuring that technology, optimization, and experimentation serve these ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. It also means establishing the necessary infrastructure, collaboration, and resources for rapid activation when future shocks occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>.

The OECD Observatory of [[Public sector innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI), in partnership with the UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation, convenes a global dialogue focusing on modern challenges and the evolving role of government, including an annual review of key [[Global public sector innovation trends | global trends]] and case studies in [[Public sector innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This partnership, active since 2016, aims to inspire action and replication of successful initiatives globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Identifying Key Trends in 2020

The year 2020, marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitated an adjustment in how innovation trends were approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A substantial knowledge base was utilized, comprising 683 cases from 91 countries submitted through OPSI's 2020 call for innovation and research, and 450 cases from the COVID-19 Innovative Response Tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Based on extensive analysis and interviews with government leaders, five key [[Public sector innovation trends | trends]] in government innovation were identified, each forming the basis of a dedicated report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:

1.  **Innovative responses to the COVID-19 crisis** Governments rapidly stepped up to take action under exceptional circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. An example highlighted was "Hack the Crisis" from Estonia, discussed by Mick Vack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
2.  **Seamless government** This concept explores how to eliminate friction points between government machinery and the citizens it serves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The UAE Ministry of Possibilities, discussed by Aer Talak, exemplifies building experimental departments for agility and proactiveness in public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
3.  **Focusing on the overlooked** This report highlights innovations addressing the needs of societal segments at risk of falling through the cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Barefoot College, discussed by Sue Stevenson, offers training to rural communities in developing countries, enabling them to bring solar electricity to their villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
4.  **Leveraging new technologies responsibly** This trend discusses the tensions governments face when using powerful new technologies for insight while mitigating harm to freedom and rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Singapore's GovTech, responsible for the "Digital Verification for National Digital Identity," was featured as a case study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
5.  **Upskilling and investing in people** This report explores how governments are innovatively investing in and upskilling their citizens and public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. "Elements of AI," presented by Teemu Roos, was featured as a case study in this report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

These reports and over 14 case studies are available at trends.oecd-opsi.org <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Case Studies and Lessons Learned

### UAE Ministry of Possibilities
Led by Aer Talak, the UAE Ministry of Possibilities is a virtual ministry launched in response to the UAE's Centennial Plan Vision 2071, which aims to make the UAE the best nation in the world by 2071 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. It serves as a neutral space, close to the core of government yet removed from traditional bureaucracies, to incubate and solve systemic "impossible" challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

*   **Structure:** It has no single active minister; instead, it relies on time-bound departments focused on priority national portfolios, applying design thinking and experimentation to develop disruptive solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. These departments bring together federal and local government teams, the private sector, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Mission Pillars:** The ministry's work is centered around four pillars: identifying impossibles, incubating virtual time-bound departments to solve issues, educating and training individuals on design and experimentation mindsets in government, and inspiring other governments with the UAE's methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[01:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. It is the first ministry dedicated entirely to incubating radical solutions for critical government challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Challenges and Lessons:**
    *   **Unknown Solutions:** Initiating projects with unknown solutions and envisioned end states is challenging for government employees who typically operate in environments of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
    *   **Adapting to Agile Methods:** Team members found it difficult to adapt to agile working methods, which focus on continuous iterations based on user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. However, a "learning by doing" approach helped acquire new skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
    *   **Common Understanding & Dedicated Teams:** Success requires a common understanding of the "impossible" and dedicated teams with specific competencies, not involved in other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
    *   **Patience:** Patience is crucial, as there will always be resistance to new approaches that challenge existing beliefs and norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Replicable Model:** The ministry has documented its methodologies to guide other governments, aiming for a replicable model once efforts are refined and tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **Empowering Teams:** Empowering teams means providing a safe zone and legal permission to incubate and test, backed by leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>. The value "protect those who try" is a core principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **Creating Synergies:** Synergies are created by bringing stakeholders on board early, understanding their cultural context, and making them part of the decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. The ministry uses a model where a cabinet minister champions a time-bound department, appointing a director and a mix of core and temporary team members, including citizens and various government entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. A leadership team, including ministers, director generals, and private company chairmen, ensures buy-in by making them "owners of the problem" rather than focusing solely on solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.

### Hack the Crisis (Estonia)
Mick Vack, Head of Accelerate Estonia, discussed "Hack the Crisis." Estonia operates as a highly digital society, with only three government services not available online, fostering a strong public-private cooperation model for over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Accelerate Estonia's mission is to find "perfect storms" – public-private collaborations that create new markets, focusing on societally important issues like mental health and environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Their tagline is "solving Wicked problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

*   **Rapid Response:** When an emergency situation was declared on March 12, the Accelerate Estonia team, largely from the private sector with hackathon experience, proposed an online hackathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Within hours, they secured ministerial support and partnerships, set up technology using existing collaborations (e.g., Event Tornado), and launched the hackathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.
*   **Impact:** The hackathon engaged over 1,000 participants, with 30 teams finishing, some resulting in actively used solutions like a government chatbot and physical assets like breathing ventilators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. This event led to nearly 70 local events worldwide, including the EU-wide "EU vs. Virus Hack" and the "Global Hack," involving around 100,000 people hacking against the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. It resulted in thousands of teams seeking immediate responses and sustainable business models, leading to new companies and improved public-private dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.
*   **Key Learnings:**
    *   **Government Capacity:** Governments need capacity to absorb incoming innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
    *   **Mental Health:** Rapid innovation can take a high toll on mental health, necessitating care for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.
    *   **"Free Radicals":** Crucial for innovation to be embedded are "free radicals" within government who take time to adopt new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
    *   **Urgency and Mission:** Successful quick innovation with the private sector requires a strong sense of urgency and mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
    *   **Pre-existing Partnerships:** Strong collaboration with hackathon organizers, the tech community, and innovative government personnel was critical for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Building these connections with the private sector is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

### Barefoot College
Sue Stevenson, Director of Strategic Partnerships and International Development at Barefoot College International, discussed their work with the world's poorest and most remote communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Founded on Gandhian principles of "Leave No Man Behind," they have programs in 93 countries across Latin America, Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and Pacific Island states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. They address 14 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

*   **Flagship Program:** Their flagship program is an innovative, multifaceted, women-led clean energy program. They train mainly illiterate and semi-literate women as "solar engineers" (Solar Mamas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
*   **Co-curriculum (ENRICH):** Based on community feedback, they developed the "ENRICH" co-curriculum, focusing on soft skills like aspirations, confidence, and competences in financial and digital inclusion, women's health, microenterprise, civil society, human rights, and environmental sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. This provides tools and knowledge to leverage energy access into other competencies for long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
*   **Sustainability Model:** Trained women return to their communities to build, install, and maintain solar systems. Households pay a portion of what they would have spent on kerosene/batteries into a village fund, which pays the solar engineers' salaries and covers replacement parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.
*   **Multifaceted Benefits:** Benefits include extended light hours, time savings from water pumping, improved education outcomes, better health outcomes (no kerosene smoke), empowerment of women and girls, environmental sustainability, and livelihood development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. This platform enables social and economic growth by putting education and technology directly into communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
*   **Why Women?** Women are viewed as catalysts due to being an untapped, largely marginalized, and restricted resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. A 2015 McKinsey report stated that achieving gender parity could increase world GDP by 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. An example from Timbuktu showed how becoming a solar engineer empowered a woman to participate in community meetings previously exclusive to men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.
*   **Government Partnerships:** Barefoot College works with governments, private organizations, and NGOs, seeking proactive investment to scale their model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
    *   **Zanzibar:** The president of Zanzibar recognized the Solar Mamas as crucial for their energy policy to reach "last mile" communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.
    *   **Madagascar:** The government partnered in building a Regional Training Center, planning to train 744 solar engineers and electrify 630,000 homes by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
    *   **Fiji:** The government is building a Regional Training Center, and the Minister for Women highlighted its role in empowering women and driving rural prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
*   **COVID-19 Response:** Barefoot College pivoted microenterprise training to help communities meet new needs (e.g., producing PPE in Zanzibar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>. They reassessed supply chains and provided funding to prevent hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. They recognized that communities, capable of self-sufficiency in the long term, primarily needed help with sudden shortfalls in income and resources caused by larger economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

### Elements of AI
Teemu Roos, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki and lead instructor of "Elements of AI," presented the initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. The goal is to improve AI literacy among the general public through online education, combating the "societal cost of the mystification of AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. This allows the public to participate in discourse needed to regulate AI and digital technologies democratically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. Critical decisions about society's thriving in the age of AI are political, not technological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

*   **Course Details:** "Elements of AI" is a free online course (www.elementsofai.com) launched over two years ago with over half a million participants globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. It requires no coding or complex math, focusing on AI literacy and understanding how these technologies affect society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. It is rated as a top AI/computer science course and is a finalist for the "innovation in politics" award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>.
*   **Global Initiative:** What makes it innovative is the initiative around the course, aiming to bring it to people through grassroots activities and local partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. It was launched in English and Finnish in 2018, then expanded to Sweden, Estonia, and Germany in local languages, and will be launched in every EU country and language by summer 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.
*   **Diversity and Impact:** The course boasts significant diversity, with 38% female users globally and a majority in Nordic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. Users include people in the working life and those up to 90 years old, with heartwarming stories of multiple generations learning together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   **Follow-up Course:** A second course, "Building AI," was launched to offer more technical content and programming, aiming to upskill people to innovate new solutions with AI and manage AI projects, transforming them from consumers to contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.
*   **Collaboration with Government:** The initiative benefited from strong support from the Finnish government and the European Commission due to the alignment of goals in promoting digital literacy for societal resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. The University of Helsinki, as a publicly funded organization, had the freedom to set its agenda, and a private company, Reactor, invested efforts without direct monetization plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. Once positive impact was demonstrated, government support and funding increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.
*   **AI is for Everyone:** The core message is that AI is for everyone, and learning about it helps people form educated opinions on its application and engage in policy dialogues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>.

## Keys to Success for Public Sector Innovation
Panelists shared insights on fostering [[Impact of innovation in the public sector | impactful innovation]] in partnership with or within government:

*   **Prove Impact and Value:** Clearly explain the value and impact of the innovation to get buy-in from all stakeholders – citizens, private sector, federal, and local entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>.
*   **Question Obstacles:** If someone says something is impossible within government, seek a second opinion. Laws can be interpreted flexibly, and governments should be prepared to take risks for breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.
*   **Systemic Approach:** Innovation labs should not just redesign outdated services but also address the systemic errors that created those services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>. This requires an agreement within the public sector to give these ideas a "lifeline" and support systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.
*   **Strategic Risk-Taking:** Governments undertake services that are too risky for the private sector. Therefore, they should be prepared to run riskier projects, acknowledging both good and bad outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>.

## Leveraging Innovative Momentum into 2021
The disruptive year of 2020 has accelerated innovation and highlighted the importance of government in partnership with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

*   **Continued Partnership:** The partnership between public, private, NGO, and social enterprise sectors is absolutely key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>. The pace of innovation seen in 2020, which might otherwise have taken 5-10 years, must continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.
*   **Focus on Crisis-Affected Areas:** Focus should remain on areas hit by the crisis requiring rapid innovation, such as mental health issues, accessibility to physical and digital services, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Balance Urgency with Long-Term Goals:** It's important to leverage the urgency brought by the crisis while balancing it with long-term commitments, such as the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.
*   **Trust in Science:** The crisis has fostered greater trust in science, which can be leveraged to address other critical issues like climate change, helping people understand that change is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>.
*   **Embrace Agility and Proactiveness:** The pandemic accelerated pre-existing strategies and demonstrated that "impossibles were made possible." Governments should continue to be bold, agile, and proactive, as seen in the UAE's cabinet restructuring with new ministerial roles focused on digital economy, AI, government development, and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.
*   **Risk of Dropping the Ball:** There's a risk of not ensuring equal distribution of benefits from innovations, particularly in online education, which could widen the knowledge or skills gap instead of shrinking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>. New innovations are needed to make benefits equally accessible to all citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Another risk is innovation labs reverting to usual procedures, which would dissatisfy people; dedication to doing things differently and trusting new approaches is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Personal Learnings for the Future
Individuals involved in [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] reflected on personal changes for the future:

*   **More Action, Less Hesitation:** Continue and intensify efforts already initiated, acknowledging the loss of physical interaction but doubling down on what has been effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   **Courage and Boldness:** Pursue initiatives with courage, even if the outcome is uncertain or it means neglecting some traditional KPIs. Aim big and do something truly impactful rather than trying to do everything perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.
*   **Nimbleness and Human-Centricity:** Continue being nimble and leveraging technology, but crucially, remember that not everything can be digitized; the human-centric aspect must be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Well-being:** Dedication to doing things differently is crucial, but it's equally important to make time for personal reflection and self-care to avoid burnout, especially when working on the "edge of government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27">[01:15:27]</a>.

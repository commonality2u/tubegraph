The latest report from OPSI (Observatory of Public Sector Innovation) focuses on tackling policy challenges through [[public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This work is supported by the European Union's research and innovation framework program, Horizon Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. EU investment in supporting governments' internal [[innovation in the public sector]] efforts was first requested in an expert group report in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, leading to a partnership with the OECD in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Over the past seven years, significant achievements have been made in supporting [[innovation in the public sector]]:
*   The OPSI platform was established, offering case studies and a toolkit navigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   The Declaration for [[public sector innovation]] was adopted in 2019, now having 43 signatories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   A Mission Action Lab was set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   The previously cautious government context has opened up to sharing experiences on [[public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   A network of national contact points with practitioners from government administrations was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   The work has moved from initial lists of 'noise' to concrete actions like 'Innovation weeks', trainings, and prizes, influencing the core business of government and policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Driving Forces and Challenges

[[Innovation in the public sector]] is seen as crucial for government agility and responsiveness, increasing public value, improving service quality for citizens, and achieving better spending, especially during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The report emphasizes that [[innovation in the public sector]] ultimately improves lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Governments worldwide face numerous critical challenges where [[public sector innovation]] is a necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>:
*   **"Permacrisis"**: Multiple parallel crises, including health, energy, climate, and geopolitical dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Welfare state model crisis**: Exacerbated since early 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Tight public finances, inflation, and potential recession** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Rising public demand**: For engagement, accountability, democratic governance, and deliberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

To address these, radical changes are needed in working methods, such as flexibility, digitization, and hybrid models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Administrations must collaborate with citizens and [[innovation in the public sector]] system actors to better utilize these methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. New organizational frameworks conducive to [[innovation in the public sector]] and capacity building are also essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

A long-term strategic approach is crucial to bridge multiple political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Focusing solely on adaptation or incremental improvement will not suffice; a "step change" is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Types of Public Sector Innovation

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) model posits that [[public sector innovation]] is needed not only to reach goals but also to adapt to different situations, implying a need for different [[types of public sector innovation]] for various goals, challenges, and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

OPSI's work involves systematic reviews of these "innovation facets," which include:
*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation**: Necessary for addressing new complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. It requires directionality, setting ambitious, targeted, and time-bound goals to instigate purpose-driven systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This facet requires institutional entrepreneurship, funding models, and governance tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. The European Commission, for example, has designed five missions under Horizon Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation**: Driven by austerity and the need to "deliver more with less" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. This involves continuously improving systems and is strongly influenced by auditing, evaluation, and performance measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Innovation**: Focuses on building agility within organizations to respond to citizens' needs and new situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. It requires allowing public sector and civil servants time and license to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Organizational drivers include making resources available and fostering a supportive culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory Innovation**: Involves taking a future-oriented stance, anticipating what is coming, building strength to meet future challenges, and developing a collective vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. It uses strategic foresight as input for decisions on opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a> and often involves transformation units to explore, experiment, and create evidence for decision-making regarding new opportunities and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

## Global Initiatives and Partnerships

The OECD and the European Commission have a long-standing collaboration on the agenda of [[innovation in public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The launch of the latest report marks another milestone in making [[public sector innovation]] efforts in governments strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The ability to innovate is considered core to government effectiveness and stability, especially in turbulent times and complex, interrelated challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Governments need to be more efficient, develop greater agility to adapt, foresight to anticipate, and ability to guide missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

The Mohamad Bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation in the UAE works closely with OPSI on the "Edge of Government" initiative, collecting hundreds of innovative cases from governments worldwide since 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:19">[01:34:19]</a>. These cases are showcased at the World Government Summit in Dubai and published in an annual report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:31">[01:34:31]</a>. In 2022, over 4,000 [[public sector innovation]] cases were collected for the global trends analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>. The UAE's approach includes ambitious, unwavering visions, pressure to deliver, and launching transformative programs with ministers signing performance contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>.

## Country Examples

Several countries are actively working with and applying the OPSI models and frameworks:

### Korea
[[Public sector innovation]] is considered very important in Korea, with strong political support being critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. The multi-faceted [[innovation in the public sector]] model provides an envisioning statement for Korean government [[public sector innovation]] strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. This approach helps in integrating different views and interests, building consensus, ensuring ownership, and increasing support for the [[public sector innovation]] agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

The Ministry of the Interior and Safety and the Government Innovation Department play vital functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. Korea is very dynamic in making methodologies and practices for measuring impacts of government [[public sector innovation]] activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>. There is a legal mandate for data-driven public administration and evidence-based policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. Both quantitative and qualitative considerations are used, relying heavily on an open [[public sector innovation]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>. Think tanks, research institutes, and academic societies cooperate to measure government behaviors and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. Mission-oriented and anticipatory [[innovation in the public sector]] are particularly important in Korea, utilizing data, technology, social media, and behavioral insights to improve accountability, social inclusiveness, and digital government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

### Austria
Austria's Federal Ministry for the Civil Service uses the OPSI facets model in several ways:
*   As an abstract model for background information on various [[public sector innovation]] approaches, helping discuss project aspects like mission fulfillment or forward-looking sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.
*   For mapping projects or instruments, such as the Common Assessment Framework (CAF) used at federal, province, and local levels as an example of enhancement-oriented [[public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.
*   "Finance online," a portal for taxpayers, is another example of enhancement-oriented [[public sector innovation]], showing how incremental innovations over time contribute decisively to organizational development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.
*   Projects like "Future of Work" (a real-life lab implementing mobile work forms) and "Digital Public Administration and Ethics" (defining ethical standards for digital technologies) are classified as anticipatory [[public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   "Greening Commutes and Duty Travels" is a mission-oriented [[public sector innovation]] project aiming to avoid or shift travel to environmentally friendly means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>.

### Sweden
Future by Lund, one of six Innovation Platforms in Sweden, works not only within municipal organizations but also with external actors (companies, universities, research institutes) to foster [[public sector innovation]] for sustainable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. They recognize that societal challenges require action from multiple actors, starting from collective sense-making and developing innovative solutions from networks and ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

They use a "zone model" to categorize [[public sector innovation]] processes:
*   **Yellow Zone**: Unclear mandate, ideation, experimentation, based on relations and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.
*   **Green Zone**: Developing ideas, forming partnerships with a shared mandate to achieve specific results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.
*   **Red Zone**: Clear mandate for a single organization to take decisions on funding and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.
The OPSI Innovation Facets model is overlaid with this zone model to discuss activities across zones and move projects forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

Future by Lund utilizes a portfolio approach to provide a holistic view for all stakeholders in the ecosystem, identify gaps or opportunities, and track the accumulated set of projects over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>. They "track" instead of "measure" system-wide innovation, documenting activities, actors involved, investment levels, and how events impact engagement and mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

## Emerging Trends and Future Outlook

Several trends are emerging in [[public sector innovation]], particularly around mission-oriented [[public sector innovation]]:
*   **Experimentation with Missions**: Many organizations (science and technology, cities, public banks) are experimenting with missions, but there is less thought on whether mission-oriented policies need mission-oriented organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>. Specific capabilities and attention to organizational setup are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Orchestration**: Missions are increasingly about galvanizing the ecosystem to work in the same direction, rather than top-down directives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. Public sector organizations need better skills in engagement and stakeholder management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Developing Dynamic Capabilities**: Due to ongoing crises, there's a growing interest in enabling the public sector to respond to and proactively shape issues around crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>. Investment in HR and training for these capabilities is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>.

There is a need to move from a public spending mentality to a "Strategic investment mentality" for managing portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>. This requires system thinking, building strategic collaborations, and hands-on engagement with stakeholders instead of just a consultation culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>.

## Tools and Approaches

A portfolio approach is essential to avoid "lock-in" in [[public sector innovation]] practices and ensure a mix of approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>. It helps in:
*   Developing a distribution of responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>.
*   Coordinating knowledge across different types of innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.
*   Tailoring projects for different types of risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:35">[01:21:35]</a>.
*   Avoiding fragmentation among projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.
*   Tackling risk aversion and fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>.
*   Building synergies between actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:02">[01:22:02]</a>.

OPSI provides tools like the "portfolio explanation tool" and the "portfolio mapper tool" to help organizations visualize, balance, and use their [[public sector innovation]] projects for strategic decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>.

Amelia emphasizes the importance of starting with "portfolio sense-making" – understanding current activities, their relation to organizational intent or mission, and identifying gaps in resources or capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:11">[01:28:11]</a>. From this, a design brief for the portfolio can be derived, utilizing design tools for project management and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:43">[01:28:43]</a>.

Rainer adds that diversity of approaches to sense-making is critical, as many organizations have a monolithic understanding of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Organizations should dedicate time for staff to learn new, diverse sense-making approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:32">[01:29:32]</a>.

The [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | COVID-19 crisis]] has profoundly affected public administration, highlighting the critical role of [[public_sector_digital_transformation | digital transformation]] in government response and future resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) has been tracking innovative responses, noting a significant acceleration in [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]] across the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Quantum Leap in Digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>
The pandemic has prompted a "Quantum Leap" in [[public_sector_digital_transformation | digital transformation]], even in countries with already high rates of digital adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Denmark, for instance, had a strong digital foundation with 74% of its population using the internet daily, 93% using mobile banking, and 86% interacting with government digitally in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>. The crisis led to a rapid scaling of existing digital infrastructure, enabling public sector employees to work from home effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. This period has been identified as a major [[digital_disruption_in_public_sector | digital disruption]] in work habits, accelerating changes that previously faced an uphill battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

### Examples of Digital Adaptation
*   **Virtual Services**: Jurisdictions began issuing virtual wedding and distant wedding registrations, showcasing the magnitude of adapting deeply human and social services to digital platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Rapid implementation of video consultations with General Practitioners (GPs) and the use of chatbots to answer COVID-19 related questions quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   **Local Commerce**: Municipalities helped develop local e-commerce platforms for shops without an online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.
*   **Public Services Hubs**: In Portugal, "We Are On It" (e-Portugal) was created as a single point of contact and a large hub, providing access to reliable and up-to-date legal information, public service workings, and direct digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. This portal is crucial for citizens and companies to access support packages and counter misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Community-driven Tech**: Platforms like "Tech for COVID-19" in Portugal emerged, bringing together over 5,000 professionals to provide solutions such as free online video consultations, tracking apps, and platforms to help local businesses sell online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **Legislatures**: Adapted to meet and scrutinize the executive in a virtual sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Libraries**: Discussing becoming "libraries in the cloud" and moving further into digital solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.
*   **Communication**: Moving from traditional "digital post" (PDFs of letters) to "next level digital communication" through platforms like Signal and Teams, especially for reaching young people who don't use email for social services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Digital Transformation
The crisis has presented both facilitation and hindrance to [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | innovation and digital transformation]]:

### Facilitators
*   **Clarity of Need**: The crisis made it unequivocally clear that change and [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | innovation]] were necessary, eliminating the bias towards existing, often inadequate, solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Legitimacy of [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | Innovation]]**: For municipalities that viewed innovation as a luxury, COVID-19 demonstrated its necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. This has increased the legitimacy of [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | public sector innovation]] generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.
*   **Breaking Barriers**: The crisis removed previous difficulties in collaboration between government departments and external stakeholders (e.g., civic tech movements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
*   **Demonstrating Value**: The crisis served as a "magnifying lens" showing the potential of innovation in bringing value, not just interesting proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.
*   **Empowering Public Servants**: The crisis has been an intense "training ground" for public servants, forcing them to work in massively new ways and develop innovative skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. This has revealed the extraordinary capacity of public administration to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>.

### Hindrances/Risks
*   **Centralization**: Crisis mode often entails a centralization of decision-making at the top, which can distance decisions about innovative solutions from frontline knowledge and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Back Burner for Non-COVID [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | Innovation]]**: [[Public sector innovation]] work not directly related to the pandemic may have been deprioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
*   **Silofication**: Specialists may "close rank," leading to innovations that work in one sector not necessarily being suitable or synchronized with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide**: Increased digitalization of public services risks exacerbating existing inequalities, especially for populations without internet access (e.g., 20% of Portugal's population lacked internet access last year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
*   **Misinformation**: The vast amount of dispersed and sometimes unreliable information circulating during a crisis poses a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
*   **Uncoordinated Efforts**: The "voluntaristic" rush to solve problems can lead to atomized, replicated initiatives that lack coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>.
*   **Social Impact**: Remote work, while enabling [[public_sector_digital_transformation | digital transformation]], can also lead to issues like loneliness among public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>.

## Trust and Open Government
The crisis has underscored the importance of trust and transparency in government. In South Africa, campaigns like "#listen to the doctors" and daily video sharing from experts helped build trust and provided citizens with technical details behind decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[0:30:31]</a>. This approach highlights the critical role of [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | public governance]] and an open government approach in managing crises and implementing [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

## The Path Forward: [[Adapting public administration for digital transformation | Building a New Normal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>
Governments must operate across immediate, medium, and long-term timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>. The crisis has revealed that normal planning processes are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. There is a need to "reimagine" the public service and economy post-COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.

### Strategies for Sustainable Digital Transformation:
*   **Strategic Timeframes**: Move from the immediate "crisis mode" to living with the crisis, then adapting in a "post-crisis world," and finally defining a "new reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.
*   **Counteracting Presentism**: While rapid solutions are vital, there's a need to enlarge the focus beyond immediate urgency to ensure solutions are sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.
*   **Embrace a "New Normal"**: Avoid a "nostalgia of normality" and instead actively build a better "new normal" based on lessons learned, recognizing that the crisis made these changes more urgent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Based Decision-Making**: Utilize evidence (qualitative and quantitative data) to inform decisions and build the new normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>.
*   **Reinvest in [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | Innovation]] Ecosystems**: Continue the collaborative spirit seen during the crisis, maintaining bidirectional engagement with entrepreneurs, scientific communities, and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.
*   **Focus on Use and Sustainability**: It's not just about producing innovative outputs, but ensuring their actual use and long-term sustainability, addressing why good ideas might not be adopted or maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>.
*   **Responsible Innovation**: Consider the anticipated and unanticipated consequences of innovations, utilizing foresight and anticipatory methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.
*   **Experimentation**: Embrace an experimental approach to [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | innovation]], allowing for testing, learning from failures, and improving to reduce risk before widespread implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.
*   **Balance Perspectives**: Dialogue and activities must balance the desire to return to old normal, to keep successful new prototypes, and to seize the "window of opportunity" for radical change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
*   **Shift Management Style**: Move from a command-and-control approach to a more socially active way of managing outcomes, fostering new trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

The crisis has been a "huge laboratory" for [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | innovation]], accelerating a gradual accumulation of small changes into a paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. The challenge is to maintain the "collective resonance" and collaborative spirit witnessed during the crisis, ensuring that participatory governance becomes the new normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a>. The future of public sector innovation should involve "less innovation theater, less sticky notes, less postage, and more dirty hands" to practice [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | innovation]] in all future crises, including the climate change crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:39">[01:27:39]</a>.

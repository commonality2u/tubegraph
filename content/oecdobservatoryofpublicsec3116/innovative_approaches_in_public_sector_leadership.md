The traditional design of 20th-century governments assumed predictable environments with established routines and available knowledge bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, events like the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed that stability is often "fictional" and the future is highly uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. In such times, governments cannot afford to stand still, as the cost of late action or inaction can be severely high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Therefore, a critical challenge for governments is to embrace uncertainty and learn how to govern towards positive future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Navigating Uncertainty

Modern challenges are global, complex, and deeply systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This requires governments to prepare rather than merely react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The core of this shift lies in recognizing that the idea of "normal" is a myth, and societies are entering a "never normal situation" of continuous fluidity and flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

Key shifts for effective leadership in uncertainty include:
*   **Abandoning misleading metaphors** Leaders should move away from metaphors like "war on the virus," which imply a clear enemy and a finite end point, and instead view challenges as complex, adaptive, natural living ecosystems requiring human and living solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Embracing Interdependence** Recognition of biological interdependence (systemic issues) and moral interdependence (all are in relationships, and the crisis disproportionately affects the vulnerable) is crucial for collective, integrated solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Learning and Unlearning** Instead of trying to predict the future, leaders must focus on using ideas about the future to make better present decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This involves fostering a "learning mindset" to learn from data, unlearn flawed old assumptions, and discover new operating methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Reimagining Government's Role

In the face of uncertainty, governments need to evolve from the traditional "control" worldview, which assumes definitive answers and rigid planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, to one that prioritizes learning and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This requires:

### Shifting Focus: From Performance to Capacity Management
Traditional performance management, often tied to hierarchical structures, can hinder learning and adaptation due to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. Moving to capacity management encourages continuous development and the learning of new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

Mindset shifts for capacity focus include:
*   **Optimization to Resilience:** Build in spillover or ramp-up capacity rather than pairing down resources to a minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **Quantitative to Qualitative Indicators:** Incorporate ethnographic stories and design thinking to listen to qualitative data, not just quantitative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **Output to Outcomes:** Focus on the desired results, which inherently leads to considering the capacity needed to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
*   **Linear to Exponential Thinking:** Recognize that system-level capacity means small inputs can have profound, non-linear effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **Scarcity to Abundance/Growth Mindsets:** Believe in the ability to learn, change, and improve over time, both for individuals and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
*   **Stable Equilibrium to Iterative Work:** Embrace continuous adjustment, experimentation, and sustained improvements through prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   **Silo to Integration:** Understand that local sub-optimization can sometimes lead to better global outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

### Redefining Leadership and Trust
In an uncertain world, the state's leadership role is not solely as a regulator or provider of order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Governments must become "ecosystem stewards," facilitating multiple interests and convening different parties to foster conversations and aggregate ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. This involves:
*   **Whole-of-Government and Whole-of-Nation Approaches:** Thinking across agencies and bringing together multiple sectors, including private, community, and individual citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
*   **Building Trust Through Co-Creation:** People buy into and trust what they help create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. This argues for [[Innovative public administration practices | participatory government]] that involves citizens in problem-solving and policy creation, rather than merely giving them what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>.
*   **Transparency in Decision-Making:** Leaders should openly communicate that decisions may change as new evidence emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. Trust in this context means accepting evolving positions based on learning, rather than rigid adherence to initial statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   **Regenerative Investments:** When taking financial risks during crises, governments should aim for investments that shape the future and have a regenerative approach, potentially involving value sharing with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
*   **Polarity-Based Thinking:** Leaders must balance seemingly competing priorities, holding opposing thoughts in their heads while continuing to function effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>. This includes balancing present needs with future considerations, micro-level impacts with macro-system stewardship, and knowing when to speed up or slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>.
*   **Focus on Relationships:** The quality of relationships and dialogue between different actors (government layers, public-private, civil society) is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. Trust in these relationships is built on credibility, reliability, and intimacy (understanding each other's viewpoints) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Empowering Citizens Through Experience:** To encourage behavioral change in citizens, governments should facilitate learning through experience, allowing citizens to see that things can be done differently and yield different outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. Special attention must be paid to the most vulnerable, ensuring their voices are heard when problems are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.

The call to action for leaders in the public sector is to cultivate the ability to learn, foster a sense of urgency for necessary actions, and shape quality relationships across all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.

Governments face an increasingly acute need to respond to emerging [[challenges_faced_by_governments_that_require_innovation | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The complex systems and problems in today's environment have become the norm rather than the exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While governments have historically excelled at reacting quickly and efficiently to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, a purely reactive approach to setting policy is proving increasingly inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## The Shift from Reactive to Proactive Governance

Many governments currently operate in a reactive mode, often setting aside future work as a separate exercise and waiting for an event to necessitate a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This contrasts with a proactive stance, where governments would anticipate and respond innovatively before issues emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The objective is to be proactive so that waiting for a crisis is no longer necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Core Capabilities for Proactive Governance
Governments need both the ability to respond to unforeseen [[challenges_faced_by_governments_that_require_innovation | challenges]] expediently and to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Crucially, they also need to anticipate different futures and [[preparing_governments_for_future_challenges | prepare for these realities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This involves building a system that helps policymakers learn from both innovation and strategic insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Why Proactive Governance is Crucial

The need for stronger [[innovation_strategies_in_government | innovation]] in the public sector is evident due to significant societal [[challenges_faced_by_governments_that_require_innovation | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, such as widespread events connected to climate change, migration, and other rapidly developing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The global pandemic has further highlighted the need for governments to react faster in more complex situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Benefits of Proactive Approaches
*   **Strengthening Trust and Democracy:** Being proactive is crucial for strengthening trust in democracy and citizens' trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Anticipatory innovation governance can also strengthen the trust of government towards its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Addressing Complex Systems:** The shift is necessary to address complex problems that are becoming the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Preventing Future Problems:** Current decisions can influence the future for millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:35">[01:50:35]</a>, highlighting the need for foresight in policy to prevent future problems like radioactive waste storage or carbon dioxide deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:10">[01:49:10]</a>.

## Key Elements of Proactive Governance

### Anticipatory Innovation Governance
This approach involves the ability to test innovations on the ground and ensure citizens have a voice, partnering with civil society, businesses, and others throughout policy cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. It requires linking anticipation with innovation to ensure that futures and foresight knowledge is not siloed but actively used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The most important factor of anticipation is that it leads to action today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Country Examples and Strategies:
*   **Finland:** At an early stage, Finland is optimistic about building a new model of governance, leveraging its strategic government program system (implemented in 2015), experience with experimentation culture, digitalization efforts, and ecosystemic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. They aim to integrate extensive foresight work with political decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Ireland:** Ireland is at the start of systematically introducing strategic foresight into its policy-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. Their "Our Public Service 2020" reform plan aims to anticipate [[challenges_faced_by_governments_that_require_innovation | challenges]] over the next 10 years, making the public service fit for purpose by 2030 and beyond, considering megatrends like climate crisis, biodiversity loss, and migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. They focus on capacity building and plugging strategic foresight into wider policy development systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.
*   **Canada:** The Canadian government has pushed for more experimentation, defining innovation as "doing new things" and experimentation as the process of rigorously measuring if those things work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. They build capacity through training programs, support communities of practice, and work on system changes, including directives for departments to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.
*   **Sweden:** The Swedish government's Comet Committee focuses on advancing technology, innovation, and ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>. Their model involves:
    1.  **Understanding:** Continuously building knowledge about what is happening, including how new technologies affect policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>.
    2.  **Testing:** Creating "regulatory greenhouses" as transparent testing grounds where different actors (agencies, companies, civil servants, civil society) can jointly test new regulations, technologies, and work ways under real conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.
    3.  **Changing:** Adopting a more agile and step-wise approach to regulation and policy development, starting with understanding, then standards or agreements, and finally legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.
*   **Norway:** Norway is developing "seamless services" for seven prioritized life events (major life transitions) to create user-centric digital services across government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. Foresight methodology and services are offered to these live events as tools and methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. Exploring future scenarios helps align stakeholders and agree upon a common mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:37">[01:21:37]</a>.

## Challenges to Implementing Proactive Approaches
Despite the clear need, [[challenges_of_government_innovation | government innovation]] faces significant hurdles:
*   **Reactive Mindset:** Governments often struggle to move beyond a reactive mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Political Will:** Motivating political decision-makers and securing their support for [[innovation_strategies_in_government | changes in governance systems]] is a particular concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   **Integration:** Lack of an inbuilt connection between intensive foresight work and actual political decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Access to Expertise and Data:** Departments often lack methodological expertise to run rigorous experiments and struggle with organized, usable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion and Openness to Failure:** Governments find it difficult to accept risks and failure, despite the fact that experiments, by nature, carry the possibility of failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. The conversation needs to shift to framing the status quo as risky, and experimentation as a way to *reduce* risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.
*   **Timelines:** The usefulness of experiments often lies in their results being available a year or two in advance, requiring an [[anticipatory_governance_in_technology_policy | anticipatory]] mindset rather than immediate crisis response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
*   **Precedent and Established Practice:** It is inherently difficult to do new things in government where precedent is powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>. Overcoming the "innovator's dilemma" — moving from established practice to new imperatives — is rife with organizational [[challenges_of_government_innovation | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Technological Dilemma:** Governments face a "double-blind position" with technology: when it's early enough to control technological development, there's little evidence; by the time evidence exists, the ability to control developments is often lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Policy-Making Processes:** Traditional policy-making processes may not be adequate for complex and ambiguous [[challenges_faced_by_governments_that_require_innovation | challenges]] like sustainability transitions, as they often result in traditional policy documents rather than fostering new economic concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:16">[02:00:16]</a>.
*   **Siloed Operations:** Futures do not fit into current government silos, necessitating cross-organizational collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:10">[01:22:10]</a>.
*   **Flexible Commitment:** Governments are accustomed to rigid roadmaps and waterfall processes, making "flexible commitment" and iterative approaches challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>.
*   **Paradigm Shifts:** It is hard to anticipate paradigm shifts and justify budgeting for them due to their unknowable nature and the difficulty in motivating change for something that hasn't happened yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:32">[02:05:32]</a>.

## Broader Implications and the Future of Governance

The urgency of [[preparing_governments_for_future_challenges | preparing governments for future challenges]] extends to ensuring the survival and evolution of democratic values and systems of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:17">[01:47:17]</a>. The need for [[anticipatory_governance_in_technology_policy | anticipatory governance]] at a global level is recognized for resolving [[policy_challenges_and_strategic_approaches | challenges]] that individual nations or regional groupings cannot tackle alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

To foster this, key levers include:
*   **Empowering People:** Giving permission to empower those directly dealing with problems to envision their own future, thus defining their own [[policy_challenges_and_strategic_approaches | problems]] and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:01">[02:21:01]</a>.
*   **Collaboration, Co-creation, Co-design:** Actively involving stakeholders from the outset to collectively address [[policy_challenges_and_strategic_approaches | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:59">[02:21:59]</a>.
*   **Humility:** Leaders must be willing to admit they don't have all the answers and commit to finding solutions together with an open mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:13">[02:22:13]</a>.
*   **Embracing Complexity:** Recognizing that systems are complex and largely uncontrollable, but can be influenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>. This means a willingness to completely rethink existing systems that are no longer viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:56">[02:06:56]</a>.
*   **Seeking Discontinuous Thinking:** Actively seeking out individuals who think beyond current advanced thinking, such as science fiction writers, to inspire imagination for paradigm shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is not merely to improve existing systems but to embark on a cultural journey of step-wise development that may take decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. It's about acting ethically in the present to shape a future, rather than solely guessing what's next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:16">[02:15:16]</a>. This involves making governments adaptable and resilient, capable of anticipating uncertain futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The current understanding of governance systems needs to be updated to better navigate the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, contributing to [[public_administration_reform | public administration reform]].

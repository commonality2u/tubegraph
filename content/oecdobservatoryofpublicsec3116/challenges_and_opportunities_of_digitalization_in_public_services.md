The COVID-19 pandemic significantly highlighted the importance of public trust for effective public policies, as well as demonstrating how public services adapted, often utilizing digital technologies, to keep citizens safe and meet their expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. While there are benefits to digitalization, its integration into public services presents both considerable challenges and opportunities.

## Opportunities of Digitalization

[[Digitalization and government services | Digitalization]] is a powerful tool with significant potential to incorporate citizens into political discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. It can be cost-free, overcoming the time barrier that often hinders political participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.

During the pandemic, digitalization immensely aided governments in dealing with the consequences of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. For instance, benefits for those out of jobs could be quickly processed through digital systems, with people receiving funds within weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. The Latvian government, for example, transitioned to a fully digital operation in one week, including web conferencing, voting, and developing an online system for new legislation where every member of society could participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

### Key Benefits

*   **Efficient Service Delivery**: Digital systems can quickly process benefits and other public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
*   **Government Transformation**: Governments can rapidly become fully digital, enabling remote work and online processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.
*   **Citizen Engagement**: Digital tools offer inclusive ways for society members to participate in policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

## Challenges of Digitalization

Despite its benefits, [[digitalization_and_government_services | digitalization]] also presents significant challenges, particularly in creating distance between citizens and government and exacerbating existing inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

### Exacerbation of Inequalities
Digitalization can replicate and worsen existing inequalities, particularly affecting vulnerable groups such as indigenous people and the elderly who may have been excluded from digital health services even before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. If inclusive co-design and co-creative methods are not used, these disparities will deepen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

### Social Media and Misinformation
The widespread use of social media allows everyone to become a media outlet, leading to the spread of misinformation and fake stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. This phenomenon can turn fact-based discussions into story-based discussions, making government policies reactive rather than proactive or strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. The challenge lies in distinguishing between freedom of speech and the dissemination of false information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

### Polarization and Trust
The pandemic has exacerbated polarization within societies, making it challenging to find common ground and communicate effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. This is partly due to the increased distance between citizens and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. A survey showed that 43% of participants did not believe their governments cared about them or were taking the right actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

### Internal Government Challenges
Within governments, there can be competition between ministries, as each represents separate group interests (e.g., education for children/parents, health for doctors/health, economy for tourism/restaurants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. When ministries work in silos rather than cooperatively, it can foster societal competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

## Strategies for Building Trust and Inclusivity in a Digital Age

To navigate the [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_administration | challenges and opportunities in public administration]] posed by digitalization, several strategies are crucial for fostering trust and ensuring inclusivity:

### Prioritizing Communication and Transparency
Clear, timely, and simple communication from governments is vital for building trust and even supporting citizens' mental health during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. Research suggests that leaders who communicate difficult truths rather than downplaying issues can gain greater public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. Governments must also maintain a clean communication line, presenting arguments based on facts rather than reacting to social media narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

### Emphasizing the Local Level
Local leaders and community-based policies are fundamental for building trust, as people often participate most and know more about issues at this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. Leveraging existing community trust and participation mechanisms can be more effective than creating new, top-down approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

### Adopting Inclusive Policy-Making Tools
[[Innovation and digital transformation in public services | Innovative]] and inclusive policy-making tools, such as co-creation processes, can help reach different groups and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Design Thinking**: This method involves designing policies around the people who use and serve them, bringing all stakeholders (e.g., doctors, nurses, managers, officials, insurance companies for a salary system) to the table to design together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. Once experienced, this inclusive process changes how public servants approach policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.
*   **One Plus Two Plus Four**: A facilitation tool where participants first think alone, then discuss in pairs, and finally in larger groups. This ensures everyone's opinions are heard and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **Empathy Maps**: Asking stakeholder groups what they think others think about them can reveal misunderstandings and open up discussions about trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

### [[Adapting public administration for digital transformation | Adapting Public Administration]]
Public administration must become more flexible and master a diverse set of tools, including big data analysis, ethnographic interviews, user experience design, and quick surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. This requires fostering a culture of humility, where leaders and civil servants are willing to admit what they don't know and ask for help from citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. It also means moving away from rigid, legalistic approaches and embracing flexibility and diversity in policy design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.

### Empowering Public Employees
Empowering public employees and giving them ownership in designing and implementing policies is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. By understanding the challenges public employees face, governments can improve their internal operations and better connect with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>.

### Cultivating Long-Term Vision and Accountability
There is a need for leadership with a long-term vision that extends beyond election cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>. This requires accountability for political actions that affect future legislation, ensuring decisions are not solely driven by short-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

Ultimately, building more [[digital_transformation_and_inclusion_in_public_services | inclusive public policy]] tools and institutions is not only a basis for better services but also empowers people and strengthens public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.

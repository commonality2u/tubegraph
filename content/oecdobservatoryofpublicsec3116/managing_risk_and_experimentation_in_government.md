This article explores how government organizations can foster [[experimentation_and_learning_in_government | experimentation]] and manage risk, drawing insights from the experience of IP Australia, a government agency in Australia responsible for intellectual property rights [00:11:17]. These insights were shared during a webinar on "making innovative public sector organizations" [00:00:05].

## IP Australia's Innovation Journey
IP Australia is the Australian government agency responsible for issuing intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, designs, and plant breeders' rights [00:11:22]. The agency is also involved in promoting awareness of IP rights and contributing to government advice on the innovation system [00:11:31]. A key factor in IP Australia's [[innovation_for_exploration_and_creativity_in_government | innovation]] journey is its status as a cost-recovered agency, funded by fees for patents and trademarks [00:12:22]. This financial independence has been crucial to their ability to invest in and manage [00:12:51] innovation [00:13:00].

The journey began significantly around eight years prior to the discussion [00:13:30], spearheaded by former Director-General Patricia Kelly and her executive team [00:13:15]. A pivotal moment was a capability review that suggested the organization's culture and embrace of [[innovation_for_exploration_and_creativity_in_government | innovation]] could be enhanced [00:13:51]. This review served as a platform, allowing IP Australia to embrace the opportunity particularly through the adoption of a clear vision and strategic plan [00:19:03]. This led to the establishment of a clear strategic direction, "Roadmap to 2030," which is incorporated annually into their corporate plan [00:19:21].

## Key Strategies for Managing Risk and Experimentation

### Dedicated Budget and Acceptance of Failure
A crucial element in IP Australia's [[innovation_for_exploration_and_creativity_in_government | innovation]] approach is the explicit dedication of a small percentage of their annual budget – less than 1% – specifically to [[experimentation_and_learning_in_government | experimentation]], technology, and ideas [00:17:01]. This commitment signifies an acceptance that not all experiments will succeed [00:17:33], acknowledging that innovation cannot be achieved without being prepared to take some risks [00:20:10]. The agency has demonstrated successes since adopting this approach [00:17:36].

### Agile Methodologies and Prototyping
IP Australia actively uses agile methodologies for its projects [00:30:54]. This involves working up prototypes in collaboration with business areas, IT, customers, and external experts [00:30:59]. This iterative process allows them to identify failures quickly and address business concerns [00:31:21]. This approach was particularly useful in building and applying AI tools [00:31:39].

### Strategic Vision and Roadmaps
The "Roadmap to 2030" provides high-level "guardrails" that set the scene for [[experimentation_and_learning_in_government | experimentation]] and continuous questioning about how to achieve their ambitious goals [00:19:58]. This long-term vision, broken down into operational excellence, service excellence, and value-added objectives, ensures that every part of the agency understands the ambition [00:21:05] and the need for risk-taking to achieve it [00:21:33]. The strategic roadmap, a deeply collaborative effort, has been a common touchstone that steers the organization's course [01:21:02].

### Partnerships and Collaboration
IP Australia frequently leverages external expertise through commercial relationships and partnerships with private sector companies [00:23:26]. This has been particularly successful in developing revolutionary tools like the Trademark Search, introduced in February 2017 [00:22:55]. This tool, combining image searching and machine learning, drastically simplified trademark searches by allowing users to upload logos instead of using text descriptions [00:23:41]. This collaboration with a private sector company, coupled with internal technicians and customer feedback, resulted in a 54% reduction in calls related to trademark searching [00:24:52].

Another successful collaborative tool is Trademark Assist, introduced in 2018 [00:25:40]. This interactive tool uses machine learning to educate and assist trademark applicants, providing tailored information and helping users submit high-quality applications [00:25:48].

The success of these partnerships often stems from long-term trust, good personal working relationships, and an internal culture that views private sector partners as collaborators [00:36:58].

### Cultivating a Risk-Aware Culture
Managing risk is intertwined with [[innovation_for_exploration_and_creativity_in_government | innovation]] and culture [00:46:05]. IP Australia faced a period where its external advisors indicated the organization was "maxed out on risk" due to four very large projects simultaneously transforming IT systems and physical workspaces [00:33:09]. Despite this, the leadership accepted the appetite for risk, which was crucial [00:33:56].

The agency is continuously working to build up staff confidence in risk management and how to deal with risk [01:07:24]. It is a shared responsibility across the organization [01:07:29]. There is a recognition that people move at different paces on the [[innovation_for_exploration_and_creativity_in_government | innovation]] journey [01:19:07].

### Adapting to Unexpected Challenges
The groundwork laid by IP Australia's focus on [[innovation_for_exploration_and_creativity_in_government | innovation]] and flexible work arrangements proved invaluable during the COVID-19 pandemic [00:37:53]. Prior investments in activity-based working spaces [00:38:15], IT infrastructure (laptops, Wi-Fi, AV equipment) [00:39:20], and flexible workplace policies [00:40:05] allowed them to scale from 100 people working remotely to 1,000 in one week [00:41:54]. A strong trust relationship with staff and a culture where managers encouraged embracing new physical infrastructure and work methods were critical [00:40:24]. This demonstrated the organization's confidence in its ability to adapt [00:43:45].

The crisis also highlighted the value of previous scenario planning, such as the national pandemic plan developed in response to H1N1 years prior [00:44:07]. Regular business continuity exercises, including a pandemic exercise just before COVID-19, also provided a "trial run" [00:44:51]. This experience suggests that agencies should be less dismissive of thinking through various future scenarios [00:46:32], aligning with [[preparing_for_future_challenges_through_government_innovation | preparing for future challenges through government innovation]].

### Bottom-Up Innovation and Communication
For young technical staff seeking to drive bottom-up [[innovation_for_exploration_and_creativity_in_government | innovation]], it is essential to understand the "bosses' framework," including their strategic objectives and risks [01:13:17]. Proposing innovations framed within this context is crucial [01:13:45]. Key advice includes:
*   Don't oversell the innovation [01:14:01].
*   Be prepared to "fail fast" and openly explain risks [01:14:07].
*   Be open to evaluation, whether it's working or not [01:14:10].
*   Cultivate strong communication skills to articulate ideas [01:15:09].
*   Do your homework by talking to customers and stakeholders, bringing evidence-based proposals [01:15:23].

An example given is a young public servant who, after talking to local innovators, proposed an ongoing collaboration, demonstrating how localized, bottom-up initiatives can align with strategic directions [01:15:53].

## Challenges and Continuous Improvement
Even with a strong [[innovation_for_exploration_and_creativity_in_government | innovation]] culture, challenges remain. IP Australia needs to refresh its "Roadmap to 2030" and strategic plan to show continuous evolution, preventing complacency and stretching out future horizons [01:05:11]. This ensures the organization remains vigilant in preparing for future scenarios [01:06:16].

While some project failures have occurred, IP Australia acknowledges the need for more systematic evaluation and lesson-learning routines [01:09:52]. It's recognized that sometimes a project should be "killed" if it's not meeting its objectives, rather than being allowed to continue struggling [01:14:33].

The agency's approach has involved periods of very [[challenges_in_governmental_innovation_and_reform | transformational change]], which created a "buzz" but also sustained pressure and "change exhaustion" for some staff [00:56:12]. This has led to calibrating the pace of change to focus more on project-driven, adaptive innovations [00:59:17] while still maintaining a healthy risk appetite [00:58:55]. This aligns with models of [[innovation_strategies_for_governments | innovation strategies for governments]] that differentiate between sustaining and transformational change [00:57:37].

The consistency of leadership in maintaining momentum across changes of leadership and over time has been crucial for IP Australia's success [01:24:50].

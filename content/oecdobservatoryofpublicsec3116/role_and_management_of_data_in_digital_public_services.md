The effective use and management of data are fundamental to designing and delivering inclusive and trustworthy digital public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Leveraging data allows governments to meet user expectations, personalize services, and improve efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

## Importance of Data in Service Delivery
Digital services should make the most of data to provide maximum benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. When data is already available in government registers, it should be utilized for the benefit of users, provided it is legally compliant and ethically acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

In Slovenia, a standard functionality on the e-government portal allows citizens to have much of their data pre-filled in application forms after authenticating with their digital identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. This data primarily comes from the central population register and can be linked to other official databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. This approach implements the "once only" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

Beyond pre-filling, efficient data exchange in the background is crucial to avoid bothering citizens with unnecessary interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. Slovenia established a multi-purpose data exchange platform over 10 years ago, connecting over 50 data sources from public administration and beyond, including banks, which resulted in significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. This platform now serves as a unified communication channel for both data users and owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>.

In France, the use of APIs and identity management to connect data is emphasized to simplify services and enable proactive service delivery to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations
While beneficial, data management presents several challenges:
*   **Access to Data:** Difficulties in getting access to data can hinder the ability to join up services effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Legal and Ethical Frameworks:** Personal data exchange requires an appropriate legal basis, adhering to standards like GDPR which mandate that data processing purposes align with original collection purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. Cross-border data exchange further complicates this, necessitating trust and strong legal frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
*   **User Consent and Trust:** Citizens often express concerns about government departments linking their data due to fears of social credit systems or misuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. Designing services that allow for clear and manageable consent is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>. Trust is built through transparency regarding the content and use of personal data, as this impacts citizens' trust in service providers and public administration as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.
*   **Complexity:** Digital tools, if not built with the right methods and experts, can complicate citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. Simply putting existing paper processes online, or building under pressure, can lead to complex and difficult services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Multi-channel Performance:** Users' digital journeys are often interrupted, requiring fine-tuning of legislation to allow for more digital-friendly approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Strategies for Effective Data Management
Several strategies are highlighted for better [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data governance for public sector innovation]] and use:

*   **Systematic Approach:** An overarching strategic data management plan is essential, covering open, closed, and personal data at technical, semantic, organizational, and legal levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. This plan promotes data use for services, monitoring, and forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   **Transparency and External Oversight:** Governments must be transparent, honest, and consistent with data use, respecting legal frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>. An outside "judge" or respected institution, such as an information commissioner or data protection authority, can help calm public debate and ensure compliance through regular checks and audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>. In Portugal, citizens are informed about which data attributes a service will access and for what purpose when they authenticate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.
*   **Common Identifiers and Interoperability Platforms:** Common identifiers like personal identification numbers and tax numbers are key for efficient data exchange and processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. Interoperability platforms and single digital gateways, like Portugal's national portal for public services, are useful technological building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
*   **User-Centric Design:** Data should be used to make services user-friendly and respect accessibility principles, always remembering vulnerable groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This includes incorporating user feedback at all stages of development and delivery, including design, testing, and post-release analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Language:** Governments need to deconstruct complex technical and administrative language and communicate simply with citizens, ensuring understanding of service functionality and data usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

## Commitments for the Future
Moving forward, there is a commitment to:
*   Accelerate [[Digital Transformation of Public Services | digital government]] by providing a common framework for designing and delivering public digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.
*   Improve data usage, leveraging data science to make faster, more agile decisions and responses, especially in emergency situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>.
*   Introduce more design thinking, co-creation, collaboration, coordination, and inclusiveness into strategies, alongside attention to skills and [[Data governance for public sector innovation | governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. The OECD Digital Government Policy Framework aims to help governments overcome remaining [[Challenges in digital government transformation | challenges in digital government transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

[[Role of Digital Tools in Government | Digital tools]] and [[technological_advancements_in_governance | technology]] can significantly improve how government works by addressing administrative burdens and enhancing citizen-government interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This involves reducing frictions and negative experiences people have when accessing public services or benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Government Initiatives and Tools

### US Biden Administration Approach
The Biden Administration in the United States has focused on reducing administrative burdens in government, tying these efforts to improving customer experience and public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Key actions include:
*   **Executive Orders:** Signing an executive order on racial equity and a more extensive customer experience executive order in December 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Guidance to Agencies:** Providing guidance from the center of government to agencies on how to measure and reduce administrative burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

### New Tools and Practices
The administration has introduced new tools and practices to modernize government processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>:
*   **Human-Centered Design (HCD):** Emphasizing the use of HCD as a policy of the government to design or review existing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   **Customer Experience Staff:** Successful agencies often have dedicated customer experience staff whose primary job is to review processes and incorporate public feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

### Repurposing Existing Processes
Existing governmental processes have been repurposed to focus more on administrative burden reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>:
*   **Budget and Performance Reporting:** Agencies are required to pay more attention to measuring and reporting on customer experience and burden reduction initiatives as part of their mandatory budget and performance reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   **Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA):** The Office of Management and Budget reinterpreted the PRA to expand its scope beyond just time spent filling out forms. It now includes consideration of learning costs, compliance costs (like gathering documentation), and psychological costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

## Strategies for Burden Reduction through Technology

[[Digitalization and government services | Digitalization]] and [[public_sector_and_technology_integration | technology integration]] are seen as key enablers for reducing administrative burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

### Automatic Renewal (Ex Parte Renewals)
*   **Concept:** Shifting the burden of proving eligibility from individuals to the state by using existing data to automatically renew benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.
*   **Medicaid Example:** The Biden Administration encouraged states to expand automatic renewal for Medicaid, a public health insurance program for low-income individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. This has led to a significant increase in automatic renewals, from about 25% to almost 50% nationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. This shift frees millions of people from paperwork and reduces the risk of losing coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   **Impact on Inequality:** Automatic renewal can "level the playing field," helping to reduce inequalities by removing hurdles that disproportionately affect disadvantaged families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

### Leveraging Administrative Data
[[Innovation in government | Innovation]] through technology allows governments to leverage administrative data to reduce burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
*   **Code for America:** This nonprofit Civic Tech firm collaborated with the state of Minnesota to help organize its administrative data, connect different data sources, and provide digestible data to caseworkers for automatic Medicaid renewals for the aged, blind, and disabled population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. This increased automatic renewals from 40% to nearly 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
*   **US Digital Service (USDS):** As an internal Civic Tech organization, USDS sent digital experts to states to help improve Medicaid services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. These "tiger teams" provided technical capacity (identifying data sources, checking code) and policy capacity (clarifying flexibilities in national policy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. This intervention helped lower-performing states reach the national average for automatic renewals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.

### Balancing Access and Privacy
While [[digital_transformation_in_government | digitalization]] can significantly reduce burdens and increase access, careful consideration is needed to avoid increasing inequality or privacy concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **Potential Pitfalls of Automation:** The use of algorithms for fraud detection (e.g., in Australia and the Netherlands) has shown that automation can go wrong, leading to disproportional focus on fraud, false positives, lack of human oversight, and shifting more burdens back to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. This highlights the importance of not having "blind faith" in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Addressing Digital Inequality:** Older adults often struggle with digital interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. When designing digital solutions, it's crucial to build an "easy road" for the majority while reallocating resources to support those facing difficulties or unusual life situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **Privacy vs. Access Trade-off:** There is a tension between privacy concerns and the desire for easier access to services through data sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>. Governments often "overvalue privacy relative to access," despite citizens' willingness to share data for convenience, especially when the data is already held by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. A "do no harm" policy for data sharing suggests that sharing data to benefit citizens is intuitively more acceptable than using it to punish them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

## Role of Behavioral Science
Behavioral science can contribute significantly to reducing administrative burdens and assessing the [[impact of innovation in the public sector | impact of innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>, particularly in the context of [[enhancement_oriented_innovation_in_government | enhancement oriented innovation]].
*   **Experimental Design:** Conducting A/B testing or randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions and identify bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.
*   **Data Analysis and Reporting:** Systematically writing up results from interventions to establish credibility and ensure governments learn from projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.
*   **Human-Centered Approaches:** Familiarizing practitioners with human-centered design and journey mapping to systematically apply design practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.
*   **Evaluation is Key:** Reminding implementers that intuitive solutions may not always work as expected, and robust evaluation is critical to ensure actual burden reduction and improved outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. For example, some interventions aimed at reducing stigma have inadvertently increased it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>.

## Conclusion
The successful [[innovation in government | innovation]] and [[digital transformation in government | digital transformation]] in government require a culture that centers on the public's experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. This involves not only cultural change but also practical changes, capacity building, inter-agency collaboration (especially for data sharing), and a willingness to simplify existing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. Governments are adept at building new systems but less so at reviewing whether existing ones are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. Technology is a powerful enabler, but its implementation must be guided by clear goals to reduce burdens and improve access, rather than inadvertently creating new ones or exacerbating inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

Public servants frequently encounter diverse challenges, problems, and situations, none of which are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. [[Methods and tools in innovation toolkits | Innovation tools]] or [[public_sector_innovation_methods_and_strategies | methods]] can be beneficial by providing new approaches or ways of operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Abundance of Innovation Tools

While there is no shortage of [[Methods and tools in innovation toolkits | tools]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, a common difficulty lies in knowing where or how to begin utilizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Hundreds of valuable [[Methods and tools in innovation toolkits | innovation tools]], toolkits, guides, and playbooks already exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The true need is for a more effective filter or a "compass" to guide individuals to the appropriate resources for their innovation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The OPSI Toolkit Navigator

The OPSI Toolkit Navigator was created to address this need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. It connects a specific situation, problem, or challenge to the relevant toolkit that can assist in finding a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, effectively filtering out unnecessary clutter to provide a clearer path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### How it Works

OPSI developed this resource through collaboration with hundreds of public servants and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:

1.  **Analysis and Organization**: Hundreds of existing toolkits were analyzed and organized based on the actions they inform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  **Situation Exploration**: The common types of situations, problems, and challenges faced by public servants were explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  **Conceptualization**: Research was conducted into how public servants typically describe what they want to achieve and how they conceptualize their situations or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Based on this, navigational path options were designed to allow the OPSI Toolkit Navigator to suggest [[Methods and tools in innovation toolkits | tools]] according to desired actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Beyond Just Tools

It is recognized that [[innovation strategies | innovation]] encompasses more than simply finding the correct [[Methods and tools in innovation toolkits | tool]] at the opportune moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Therefore, the OPSI Toolkit Navigator also provides connections to:

*   [[Skills and Approaches for Innovation Ecosystems | Skills]] and capacity building resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Real-life [[examples_of_innovation_types_in_action | case studies of innovation]] in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Fellow public servants and experts who have navigated similar paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

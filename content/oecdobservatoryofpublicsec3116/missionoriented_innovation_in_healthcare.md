[[missionoriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is a coordinated package of initiatives tailored to mobilize science, technology, innovation, and beyond, in order to address a societal challenge in a very precise way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. This approach aims to solve problems that would otherwise remain unaddressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>.

## Definition of [[missionoriented_innovation | Mission-Oriented Innovation]]

[[missionoriented_innovation | Missions]] are "[[purpose_driven_innovation | purpose-driven]], ambitious tasks and outcomes that we really want to commit to to achieve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. They are not merely about simple improvements, but about solving significant challenges collaboratively through innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Key characteristics of [[missionoriented_innovation | missions]] include:
*   **Ambitious and concrete goals** to be met within a defined time frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   Spanning **several stages of the innovation cycle**, from research and demonstration to clinical trials and market launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   Crossing **various disciplines, sectors, and policy silos** (e.g., between ministries, agencies, or different communities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>.
*   Utilizing **different types of support instruments**, including supply-side and demand-side approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

The essence of [[missionoriented_innovation | mission orientation]] lies in the **integration** of these aspects, specifically tailored to achieve a particular mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

## Why [[missionoriented_innovation | Missions]] in Healthcare?

Healthcare is an "adaptive complex system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, characterized by intricate relationships between diagnosis, decision-making, treatment, outcomes, infrastructure, regulations, and global perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Attempts to change one part of this system can cause unpredictable ripples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

[[missionoriented_innovation | Missions]] provide an approach to move these complex adaptive systems to a "different and a more desirable state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>. This is particularly relevant in Europe, where there is a shared belief in universal healthcare that needs to be preserved and improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>.

Major challenges like cancer, with 2.7 million diagnoses and 1.3 million deaths in Europe in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, necessitate a [[purpose_driven_innovation | purpose-driven]] and impactful approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This requires a paradigm shift in healthcare, embracing personalized medicine for tailored and impactful approaches, and ensuring equal access to diagnosis and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Opportunities of [[missionoriented_innovation | Mission-Oriented Innovation]]

[[Mission-Oriented Innovation | Mission-oriented initiatives]] offer several opportunities:
*   **Broader Engagement:** Fostering engagement beyond traditional silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.
*   **Stronger Direction & Momentum:** Providing clear direction towards public goods and generating inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>.
*   **Policy Coordination:** Leading to fewer overlaps, more collective action, and consistent plans across silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.
*   **Neutral & Open Approach:** Coordinating diverse actions to explore various solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.
*   **Intentional Policy Mix:** Combining different tools and articulating knowledge supply and demand, along with pooling resources and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.

## Challenges of [[missionoriented_innovation | Mission-Oriented Innovation]]

Despite the opportunities, implementing [[missionoriented_innovation | missions]] presents challenges:
*   **Setting "Real" Missions:** Ensuring goals are truly bold, targeted, and measurable, avoiding "mission washing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.
*   **Going Beyond S&T:** Moving beyond purely scientific and technological solutions to address behavioral and systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.
*   **Complex Governance:** Managing multi-level, cross-ministerial, and cross-agency governance structures, which can be heavy and complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.
*   **Engaging Non-STI Stakeholders:** Difficulty in engaging actors beyond science, technology, and innovation, including citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact:** Lack of established methodologies and tools for measuring the impact of systemic interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
*   **Scaling Up:** Challenges in scaling successful initiatives from subsystems to broader applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.
*   **Addressing Incumbent Biases:** Overcoming resistance to disruptive changes in established roles and technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Quick Win" Mentality:** Shifting from single-point projects to a broader ecosystem-wide portfolio with a clear vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.
*   **Timing Coherence:** Aligning different policies and initiatives to ensure systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:41">[00:49:41]</a>.
*   **Lack of Concrete Methodology:** Needing clear methods and a theory of change for how to achieve goals and assign responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### Vision Zero Cancer (Sweden)

Vision Zero Cancer is a [[purpose_driven_innovation | vision-driven innovation]] milieu where actors across society collaborate to beat cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:38">[02:22:38]</a>. While starting in Sweden, it has a global ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:48">[02:22:48]</a>. It aims to build a resilient society through collaboration and innovation, placing the citizen and patient at the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:57">[02:22:57]</a>. This multi-stakeholder initiative for system innovation in cancer control was established through a call from the Swedish innovation agency Vinnova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:24">[02:25:24]</a>.

**Goals:**
*   Reduce cancer onset and transform cancer from a deadly to a curable or chronic disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:23">[02:25:23]</a>.
*   Ensure cancer care is delivered equitably and with high quality to all who need it by the end of 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:41">[02:25:41]</a>.
*   Work holistically across prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:16">[02:26:16]</a>.
*   Stimulate clinical trials and implement personalized medicine for cancer patients across Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:51">[02:50:51]</a>.

**Structure & Approach:**
*   Managed as a partnership and coordinated by the research institute at Stockholm School of Economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.
*   Founded on a [[MissionOriented_Innovation | quintuple helix]] collaboration, gathering people from different sectors: large industrial companies, local authorities and regions, regional cancer centers, cancer society, patient associations, academia, and industry associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:50">[02:39:50]</a>. Currently has about 40 partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>.
*   Aims to be a "one-stop shop" for innovation in cancer care in Sweden, moving from isolated initiatives to a national point of contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:47">[02:59:47]</a>.
*   The "vision" is an ethical standpoint ("no one should die of cancer and more people should live longer and better"), with "missions" setting concrete targets below this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:43">[03:01:43]</a>.
*   Focuses on learning to engage in new ways and developing mechanisms, tools, and practices for working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:22">[03:22:22]</a>.
*   Actions are identified and prioritized by the core team, but also constantly seek to attract and relate to other initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:48">[03:14:48]</a>.
*   Projects are evaluated based on their contribution to the 2030 agenda and vision, considering goals, purpose, expected results, benefits for end-users, gender aspects, societal [[impact_of_mission_oriented_innovation_on_society | impact]], implementation possibilities, and scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:32">[03:16:32]</a>.
*   Emphasizes active leadership, managing different interests, appreciating diverse knowledge, and building a community of values and cultures based on cooperation and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:31">[03:42:31]</a>.
*   Initial focus was on lung cancer, with a move towards an agnostic approach and pediatric cancer, emphasizing personalized medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:16">[03:13:16]</a>.
*   Launched "Testbed Sweden" for precision medicine to stimulate clinical trials and implement personalized medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:41">[02:08:41]</a>.

### Australia's Genomics Health Futures Mission

The Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF), established in 2015, is a long-term sustainable source of research funding in Australia, aiming to transform health and medical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>. It oversees eight research missions, including the Australian Brain Cancer Mission (AUD 50 million government, AUD 133 million leveraged) and the Genomics Health Futures Mission (AUD 500 million over 10 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

**Approach:**
*   Missions focus on areas of unmet need, are priority-led, planned, coordinated, and outcome-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>.
*   They harness resources across the system, requiring investment, leadership, and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.
*   Utilize innovative research approaches and different grant models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.
*   Each mission is supported by an expert advisory panel of diverse field experts (researchers, consumers) who advise the minister on strategic priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.
*   Panels develop a high-level "Roadmap" (e.g., Genomics Health Futures Mission goal: "save or transform the lives of more than 200,000 Australians through genomic research") and a more detailed "Implementation Plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>. The roadmap identifies priority areas for investment, covering both technological and community/engagement aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.
*   Strategic documents are drafted by the expert panel, reviewed by an international panel, and then undergo public consultation (webinars, online submissions) before finalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>.

**Challenges and Lessons Learned:**
*   **Managing conflicts of interest:** Difficult in a smaller community where experts might also seek research funding. Diversity of membership (not just researchers) and international membership helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>.
*   **Working within a 10-year time frame:** Difficult to forecast priorities and define what can be achieved within the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>.
*   **Mission budget limitations:** Budgets vary (AUD 50-500 million over 10 years), making it hard to narrow the scope of key priority areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>.
*   **Translating goals into investments:** Ensuring short, medium, and long-term investments link back to the overarching mission goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:52">[01:26:52]</a>.
*   **Identifying clear metrics for performance:** Difficult to articulate measurable outcomes that attribute to the mission's goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>.
*   **Leveraging opportunities:** Finding ways to increase the [[impact_of_mission_oriented_innovation_on_society | impact]] beyond direct funding, through partnerships and international collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>.
*   **Clear Terms of Reference for Expert Panels:** Essential to articulate finite budgets and the need to narrow scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:35">[01:29:35]</a>.
*   **Early Evaluation:** Critical to check if funded grants meet objectives and refine the mission's path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>.
*   **Identifying "partners in the sector":** Collaborations and consortia are crucial for advocating for the mission and increasing its [[impact_and_strategic_orientation_of_innovation_missions | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>.

### Germany's National Decade Against Cancer

Part of Germany's High-Tech Strategy 2025, the National Decade Against Cancer is one of two health missions (the other being digitization of medicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>. Launched in January 2019, it aims to be a long-running, multi-stakeholder initiative with broad public visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. The earmarked budget is 1 billion Euro over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>.

**Strategic Aims:**
*   Improve cancer patients' lives through fast transfer of innovations into clinical practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10">[01:39:10]</a>.
*   Reduce preventable cancer cases by 10% every 10 years (from 40% down to 36% in the first decade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:26">[01:39:26]</a>.
*   Allow access to all patients by networking research institutes with high-quality care hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.
*   Improve communication with citizens, especially on cancer prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>.
*   Educate the next generation of cancer researchers and clinicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:18">[01:40:18]</a>.

**Structure & Initial Results:**
*   Brings together key players from medicine, research, society (including patients), politics (Ministry of Health involved), regulatory authorities, and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.
*   Led by a high-level Strategy Committee (parliamentary secretary level) composed of diverse stakeholder groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:23">[01:42:23]</a>.
*   The strategy committee leads working groups on "grand challenges" in cancer research, cancer prevention, and networking research and care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:31">[01:44:31]</a>.
*   Launched major funding programs (e.g., "Practice-Changing Clinical Trials" - EUR 60M+, "Tumor Heterogeneity" - EUR 40M) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:22">[01:45:22]</a>.
*   Extended the National Center for Tumor Diseases, adding four new centers (EUR 100M/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:55">[01:45:55]</a>.
*   Engaged in comprehensive public dialogue, collecting thousands of feedbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>.
*   Initiated a process to define principles of patient involvement in research at the EU level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>.

**Challenges:**
*   **Sustaining long-term commitment:** Difficult to keep all stakeholders engaged for 10 years and maintain public attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:56">[01:47:56]</a>.
*   **Accommodating particular interests:** Aligning the decade's activities with diverse stakeholder interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a>.
*   **Common ownership:** Some partners are more involved due to direct benefits (e.g., researchers shaping funding opportunities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:40">[01:48:40]</a>.
*   **Involving many authorities/competences:** Integrating health research, regulatory systems, health insurers, public, patient representatives, and industry, who often have very different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:06">[01:49:06]</a>.
*   **Changing culture of cancer research:** Pushing for stronger patient involvement in patient-oriented research, which requires cultural change for both clinicians and patients (e.g., serious listening, education, common decision-making, language barriers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:41">[01:49:41]</a>.

### Netherlands' Top Sector Policy for Life Sciences & Health

The Netherlands has 25 [[MissionOriented_Innovation | missions]] divided into four societal themes, including Health and Care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:16">[01:56:16]</a>. The Ministry of Economic Affairs leads the overall policy, while the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports is responsible for designing the health mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:51">[01:55:51]</a>. Health Holland acts as the coordinator for the realization of these missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:52">[01:56:52]</a>. The total investment across 97 partners (researchers, entrepreneurs, governments, citizens) is 1.1 billion Euro each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:30">[01:57:30]</a>.

**Approach - "New Narratives" and Field Labs:**
*   Emphasizes new narratives, new language, and trust to support a major transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:19">[01:58:19]</a>.
*   **Co-creation** is central, involving sharing processes, costs, risks, and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:17">[01:59:17]</a>. This means welcoming uncertainty and experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:48">[01:59:48]</a>.
*   **Field Labs** are key instruments for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:46">[01:58:46]</a>. They are mostly physical places or initiatives working with local communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:51">[02:07:51]</a>.
*   Utilizes a **multi-level perspective** (landscape, regime, niche) for sustainable transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>. The approach starts at the "niche" (local initiatives), connects actors across layers (regional, national), and builds trust and co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:16">[02:02:16]</a>. The aim is to reach a "tipping point" where the group committed to the new normal is too large to go back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:14">[02:03:14]</a>.
*   Example: A Dutch healthcare organization for dementia patients, "Don t Louise," shared its dream with the whole village, inviting diverse actors (baker, municipality, tech entrepreneurs, school, neighbors) to contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:31">[02:03:31]</a>. This resulted in an open village where residents can freely walk, enabled by community and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:31">[02:04:31]</a>.
*   Field labs work with a population of at least 100,000 people to attract investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:51">[02:05:51]</a>.
*   Formal cooperation agreements and governance structures are based on five key elements: monitoring, working together, learning together, ICT and data, and financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:02">[02:11:02]</a>.
*   Encourages peer-to-peer learning among field labs and national-to-field lab learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:50">[02:12:50]</a>.

**Challenges:**
*   **Connecting national procedures/policy makers to local initiatives:** A matter of language and tempo, as local levels desire quick fixes while ministries operate at a different pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:58">[02:13:58]</a>. This requires encouraging regional actors to consistently share their stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:45">[02:14:45]</a>.

### UK - Camden Council's Food Mission

Camden Council, a local authority in London, embarked on a mission-oriented journey after the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted existing structural inequalities, particularly in health and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:34">[02:17:34]</a>. The council launched the "Commission on the Future of Camden," which identified four renewal missions, including one around food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:54">[02:18:54]</a>.

**Mission Statement:** "Fighting effectively everyone is wealthy with nutritious, affordable, sustainable food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:32">[02:19:32]</a>. This statement emphasizes the cross-cutting nature of the challenge (climate emergency, food poverty, inequalities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:40">[02:19:40]</a>.

**Approach & Learning Journey:**
*   [[MissionOriented_Innovation | Missions]] are seen as a "vehicle to grow a movement," starting with a council decision but becoming a continuous effort driven by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:57">[02:19:57]</a>.
*   The council uses a "mission on a page" framework to capture components: layers of the mission, story, issues/root causes, system of problems, opportunity areas, tools/levers, and success metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:20">[02:21:20]</a>.
*   **Working in conditions of uncertainty:** Difficult to have a project plan when the outcome is unknown or when influencing other actors. Requires extensive storytelling, both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>.
*   **Balancing short-term delivery with long-term vision:** Addressing immediate problems (e.g., food poverty now) while maintaining a long-term, inspirational approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:32">[02:22:32]</a>.
*   **Defining the mission's role:** A continuous process, with the mission evolving to change and take different roles (e.g., enabling infrastructure, network builder, learning facilitator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>.
*   **Breaking silos:** Requires establishing new internal governance structures, ways of working, and decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:15">[02:23:15]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability:** Organizations need to be open to listening, deliberation, and criticism to truly improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a>.
*   **Changing established processes:** Convincing internal stakeholders that [[MissionOriented_Innovation | missions]] are enablers, not just added tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:50">[02:23:50]</a>.
*   **Leadership backing:** Senior leadership that tolerates uncertainty and doesn't expect perfect answers is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:44">[02:24:44]</a>.
*   **Language matters:** Communicating the mission in an encouraging, inclusive, and relatable way, avoiding technical jargon, so it doesn't sound like "just another strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:20">[02:25:20]</a>.

**Challenges:**
*   **Impact at a higher level:** As a local authority, influencing regional or national policy is a challenge, but Camden aims to be a voice for other boroughs and build coalitions for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:40">[02:26:40]</a>.
*   **Organizational resilience:** Maintaining optimism and faith despite resistance and the need for continuous adaptation and rethinking of structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:10">[02:28:10]</a>.

## Conclusion

The experiences from these diverse contexts demonstrate that [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] in healthcare is a complex but vital undertaking. It demands a shift towards [[purpose_driven_innovation | purpose-driven]], systemic change, requiring active stakeholder engagement, flexible governance, and a willingness to learn and adapt. While challenges such as managing diverse interests, measuring long-term [[impact_and_strategic_orientation_of_innovation_missions | impact]], and overcoming established bureaucratic cultures persist, the shared ambition to address pressing societal health challenges drives continued collaboration and innovation.

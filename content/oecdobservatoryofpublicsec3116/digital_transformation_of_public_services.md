The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the urgent need for more innovative and agile government, underscoring that public governance is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. In response, countries have seen a significant acceleration in [[Digital Transformation in Government|digital transformation]] efforts within public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

## Drivers of Digital Transformation

The immediate demands of the crisis have compelled public administrations to deliver services in new ways, overcoming previous barriers to digital adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>.

*   **Urgency:** The crisis necessitated rapid, hands-on solutions to enable remote work and provide quick answers to new demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>.
*   **Removal of Bias:** The crisis removed the bias towards existing solutions, as their inadequacy became apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Increased Legitimacy:** For some municipalities, innovation, previously seen as a luxury, has proven to be a necessity, increasing its legitimacy in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure Availability:** In countries like Denmark, existing digital infrastructure (e.g., 74% daily internet use, 93% mobile banking, 86% government digital interaction, 90% official digital post in 2019) allowed for massive scaling of capacity when employees were sent home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.
*   **Shift in Work Habits:** Full-time remote work during the crisis significantly disrupted digital work habits, potentially leading to lasting transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

## Examples of Digital Innovations

Governments and civil society organizations have rapidly deployed digital solutions to address crisis needs:

*   **Integrated Portals:** Portugal launched "we are on it" (estamos ON) as a single point of contact and a large hub, providing access to reliable information, legal initiatives, public service workings, and direct digital services via the e-Portugal portal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This portal also offers direct access to support programs for citizens and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Virtual Service Delivery:**
    *   Virtual weddings and distant wedding registrations have been introduced in some jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
    *   Rapid implementation of technologies like video consultations with GPs and chatbots for quick COVID-19 related questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
    *   Community-led platforms like "Tech for Covid-19" in Portugal offered free online consultations via video channels and apps, and supported local businesses to sell online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
    *   Libraries in Denmark are exploring becoming "libraries in the cloud" and moving further into digital solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.
    *   Next-level [[Digital Transformation in Public Administration|digital communication]] between government and citizens, moving beyond static PDFs to more interactive platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.
    *   Social services have adapted to use phone, text platforms like Signal and Teams, especially for young people who may not use email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
*   **Legislative Adaptations:** Legislatures have implemented adaptive responses, such as virtual meetings, to continue their oversight role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Information Dissemination:** Governments are using influencers to reach broader and different audiences with official messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. South Africa implemented "listen to the doctors" and "listen to the experts" social media campaigns, sharing daily videos from experts to build trust and share technical details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Work Plans:** Portugal's collaborative work plan for public administration involved 22 projects led by 27 public entities and civil society organizations working together to promote innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations in Digital Transformation

Despite the rapid advances, [[Challenges and opportunities in public sector digital transformation|digital transformation]] during a crisis also presents significant challenges:

*   **Information Overload and Misinformation:** The proliferation of information, both reliable and unreliable, across various channels, including social media, makes it difficult to provide a clear, central answer to public queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.
*   **Risk of Atomized Initiatives:** The urgent need to solve problems can lead to rushed or fragmented initiatives that sometimes replicate efforts without proper coordination or dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide:** A significant concern is ensuring that the [[Digitalization of government services|digitalization of government services]] does not exacerbate existing inequalities, especially for populations with limited internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. In Portugal, 20% of the population lacked internet access in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.
*   **Remote Work Issues:** While enabling remote work, the virtualization of public service has also created new issues, such as loneliness among public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>.
*   **Not a Silver Bullet:** [[Digitalization of government services|Digitization of public services]] is not a panacea; it addresses immediate problems like reducing physical contact but introduces new demands and doesn't solve all underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. It's about the use of technology and access to it, not just the technology itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>.
*   **Privacy and Surveillance:** The development of tracking apps, like those in Denmark, raises concerns about privacy and requires public debate, ensuring people are fully aware of how their data is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.

## Sustaining Digital Transformation Beyond the Crisis

To prevent a return to old defaults and embed the gains of [[Digital Transformation in Public Administration|digital transformation]] in the long term, several strategies are crucial:

*   **Identify Tipping Points:** Governments must identify and push "tipping points" to move towards a new, stable system, leveraging new trust built during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>.
*   **Reimagine the Public Service:** The crisis reveals that normal planning processes are insufficient, necessitating a reimagining of public service, country, and economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>.
*   **Scenario Planning:** Using a scenario approach (short-term, medium-term, long-term) can help build future visions and integrate anticipatory governance and [[agile_and_digital_transformation_in_government | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Based Decision-Making:** Moving beyond assumptions about the "new normal" requires using evidence-based decision-making processes, triangulating qualitative and quantitative data to understand and analyze vast amounts of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>.
*   **Invest in Innovation Ecosystems:** Reinvesting in and continuously engaging with the innovation ecosystem (entrepreneurs, scientific community, public administration) is vital for sustained transfer of knowledge and crowdsourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.
*   **Focus on Use and Sustainability:** The challenge isn't just generating solutions but ensuring their actual use and long-term sustainability. It's crucial to understand why solutions aren't used and to plan for their ongoing management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>.
*   **Responsible Innovation:** Innovation must be responsible, considering anticipated and unanticipated consequences, and utilizing foresight methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.
*   **Embrace Experimentation:** Innovation is about experimentation – testing, learning from failures, and improving to reduce risk before widespread implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
*   **Empower Public Servants:** The crisis has served as an intense training ground for public servants, demonstrating their adaptive and innovative capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>. Continued investment in individual capabilities and creating an environment where professionals can innovate within their fields and learn across sectors is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[01:21:46]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Innovation:** The crisis has brought innovation to parity with other government priorities; this moment must be used to advocate for a systems-wide rethink and refocus on institutional capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:42">[01:22:42]</a>.
*   **Engage Citizens:** A participatory state model, where collaboration and citizen engagement in shaping innovations become the "new normal," is important for creating an inclusive and enduring environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:03">[01:20:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a>.

The collective experience of the crisis, characterized by a "collective resonance" among citizens and public servants, provides a unique opportunity to build a new and better normal, rather than simply returning to the old one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>. The shift requires less "innovation theater" and more "dirty hands" – practical application and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>.

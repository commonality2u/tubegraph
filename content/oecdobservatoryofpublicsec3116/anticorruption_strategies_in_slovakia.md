This article details a project focused on strengthening public integrity in Slovakia, emphasizing the application of behavioral insights to improve anticorruption efforts. The project, a collaboration between Slovakia and the OECD, aimed to enhance capacities within the Slovak public administration and explore innovative approaches to corruption prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Project Overview and Context

For four years, the OECD worked with Slovak institutions, including the Anti-corruption Prevention Department and the Government Office, to reinforce integrity. The project involved analytical work, capacity building for civil servants to implement integrity measures, and the development of concrete tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:05">[03:05:05]</a>.

Key areas of focus included:
*   Incorporating a strategic approach to integrity policies, particularly within the framework of the former National anti-corruption policy of the Slovak Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.
*   Improving horizontal coordination across integrity functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   Engaging the whole of society in integrity efforts to ensure fit-for-purpose reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   Applying a behavioral risk-based approach to corruption prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. This approach is crucial for identifying and mitigating prevalent and pressing risks, thereby making corruption prevention more effective and strengthening accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

The project built upon the Integrity Review of the Slovak Republic, published in 2022, which provided a comprehensive view of the Slovak integrity system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. A key finding of this review was that while Slovakia had implemented measures to strengthen [[challenges_in_corruption_risk_management | corruption risk management]], the practical application of these frameworks was still lagging. This challenge is not unique to Slovakia but is shared across many OECD countries, as highlighted in the recent Anti-corruption & Integrity Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## The Role of Behavioral Insights

The work in Slovakia is rooted in the OECD Recommendation on Public Integrity, launched in 2017. This recommendation advocates for a sustainable and strategic approach to fighting corruption by shifting focus from ad hoc policies to a context-dependent, behavioral risk-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. It also emphasizes cultivating a culture of integrity across the whole of society, including public servants, businesses, civil society organizations, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

Behavioral insights are crucial for anti-corruption and integrity measures in two main areas:
1.  **Supporting Ethical Choices:** Traditional anti-corruption measures often focus on punishing corrupt individuals. However, behavioral research suggests that most people possess a moral compass and strive to act with integrity, even when unobserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. Policies should empower these public officials and foster an environment that supports ethical choices, creating an "open culture of integrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
2.  **Ensuring Effective Implementation of Integrity Policies:** Policies may fail to achieve their desired impact or even backfire if they do not consider the real behaviors of public officials during implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.

The OECD has conducted extensive work on applying behavioral insights to public integrity since 2018, with previous projects in Brazil, Romania, and Chile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. The project in Slovakia is notable for producing the first experimental evidence in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:11]</a>.

## The Experiment: Encouraging Risk Reporting

The core question for the experiment in Slovakia was: How can public sector employees be empowered to detect corruption risks and feel safe reporting them? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>

The methodology followed the OECD's BASIC framework for applied behavioral science:
*   **Behavior (B):** Initial diagnosis revealed several behaviors that hindered reporting, including managers "ticking the box" on formal requirements without practical adherence to conduct codes, misreporting progress on plans (e.g., National Recovery and Resilience Plan), and underutilization of electronic reporting surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>. The primary target behavior identified was the widespread reluctance of employees to speak up about *potential* corruption risks due to a "culture of fear and silence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>. Employees knew to report incidents, but the line was blurred for potential risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.
*   **Analysis (A):** Drivers of silence included:
    *   Lack of good examples from leaders, who often did not speak up themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.
    *   Limited understanding of existing reporting channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.
    *   Psychological costs, such as fear of retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.
    *   Lack of a feedback mechanism after reporting, leading to uncertainty about what would happen next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy (S):** The experiment focused on addressing two specific barriers:
    1.  Lack of understanding regarding what constitutes a reportable risk (i.e., clarifying that potential risks should also be reported) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:46:00">[23:46:00]</a>.
    2.  Lack of good examples from leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>.
*   **Intervention (I):** A randomized vignette experiment was conducted with 2,537 public servants from line ministries and central authorities. Participants were presented with a hypothetical scenario involving potential conflict of interest risks in hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a>. They were randomized into three groups:
    *   **Control Group:** Received no intervention message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:00">[25:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Treatment 1 (Understanding of Risk):** A message using a health analogy ("being honest and speaking with your doctor about risk factors... can help diagnose cancer in time") to explain the importance of reporting potential corruption risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>.
    *   **Treatment 2 (Exemplary Leadership):** A message imagining a manager leading by example, raising hiring risks, and encouraging colleagues to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a>. Both treatment messages concluded with an injunctive social norm: "Every civil servant should be honest and speak about corruption risks." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>.
    *   To encourage participation, a lottery offered three individuals a 15-minute chat with the Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:58:00">[29:58:00]</a>.

### Key Findings of the Experiment
*   In the control group, only 48% of respondents were likely to communicate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47:00">[31:47:47]</a>.
*   The **Exemplary Leadership** message was the most impactful, increasing the likelihood of communicating a risk by approximately 14 percentage points compared to the control group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:00">[33:27:00]</a>.
*   The **Understanding of Risk** message increased the likelihood of communicating a risk by approximately 9 percentage points compared to the control group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[33:42:00]</a>.
*   Overall, the experiment demonstrated that behavioral insights could increase integrity among public officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:56:00">[33:56:00]</a>.
*   **Age effect:** Younger respondents were significantly more likely to communicate a corruption risk. For every year increase in age, the likelihood to communicate an integrity risk decreased by 0.23 percentage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>. This could be due to a greater fear of retaliation and a stronger status quo bias among more senior individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>. Career length, however, did not correlate with the likelihood to communicate a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>.
*   **Feeling of Safety:** Both treatments increased the feeling of safety among respondents, though the effect sizes were small (around three percentage points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a>. Those who preferred to communicate a risk to their manager felt significantly safer, and this was also the most common preferred option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:00">[35:52:00]</a>.
*   **Trust in the System:** Trust in the risk management system correlated with the feeling of safety and likelihood to communicate, meaning people who trusted the system were more likely to feel safe and report corruption risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:00">[36:58:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding of Risk (measured post-treatment):** On average, only 30.8% of respondents correctly identified the vignette situation as a corruption risk. Neither treatment significantly improved this understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:00">[37:34:00]</a>.

## Recommendations for Slovakia

Based on these findings, the project offers three main recommendations for Slovakia, particularly as it formulates a new National Anti-corruption Strategy for 2024-2029:

### 1. Empower Leaders to Set the Standard
The strong impact of the leadership message highlights the importance of equipping leaders with the knowledge, skills, and resources to lead by example and act with integrity. Anti-corruption coordinators also play a key role in setting this example across agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:14:00">[39:14:00]</a>.

### 2. Make Risk Communication Easy and Well Understood
Policies should align with how people behave. Since employees prefer reporting to their managers, this channel should be explicitly supported and made safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:32:00">[40:32:00]</a>. Awareness of existing channels, such as electronic surveys, needs to be raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:02:00">[41:02:00]</a>. Clear, concise, and behaviorally informed guidelines should be implemented to ensure everyone knows how to report a corruption risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>.

### 3. Cultivate a Culture of Safety
Feelings of safety are crucial for encouraging people to speak up. It is essential to foster an environment where reporting is a social norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>. This means addressing fears of retaliation and ensuring that reported risks lead to tangible action, closing the feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Future Work

This study represents a significant step in applying behavioral science to complex and sensitive policy issues like public integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:50:00">[53:50:00]</a>. The use of vignettes and randomized assignment allowed for rigorous testing of interventions and demonstrated that even small changes in messaging can lead to substantial behavioral shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[48:03:00]</a>.

While the current experiment provides "concrete lines of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>, future work should focus on scaling up these interventions in real-world settings across multiple public administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. This could involve testing different reporting channels or the impact of training programs for leaders and employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.

The project highlights the evolving understanding of corruption and the importance of adapting strategies. Ethical standards, for instance, are not static and have changed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>. Addressing public integrity also means considering the wider societal context and educating future generations on ethical behavior from an early age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:26">[01:28:26]</a>. This proactive approach to promoting integrity can help cultivate a more ethical public service and society.

Public sector innovation is defined as something novel in its context, implemented, and bringing about a shift in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Innovation can vary in scale (big or small) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> and certainty (more or less certain process) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It can also emerge in a top-down (directed) or bottom-up (undirected) manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Given its many facets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, a framework is needed to understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The OECD Public Sector Innovation Model

The [[Role of the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation | OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation]] developed a public sector innovation model to make sense of the multifaceted nature of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This model is based on two core features of innovation:
*   How directed the innovation process is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   How uncertain the process is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>

From these two axes, four distinct facets of innovation emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This is known as the [[Innovation Facets Model | Innovation Facets Model]].

### Four Facets of Innovation

1.  **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation**
    *   **Goal**: To make existing products, services, and processes more effective and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   **Example**: Using behavioral insights to encourage people to pay their taxes on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

2.  **Mission-Oriented Innovation**
    *   **Goal**: To solve specific problems and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: Historical efforts to reach the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, or contemporary initiatives to switch to sustainable energy to counteract climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

3.  **Anticipatory Innovation**
    *   **Goal**: To influence future developments before they become fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
    *   **Example**: Exploring the ethical and technological boundaries that artificial intelligence projects should adhere to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

4.  **Adaptive Innovation**
    *   **Goal**: The exploration of what is possible and the process of discovering what could be or might be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   **Example**: The emergence of social media, which introduced new ways for government and citizens to interact, reshaping expectations and creating new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### The Need for a Balanced Innovation Portfolio

Since innovation is multifaceted, there is no single, one-size-fits-all approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Focusing on only one or two facets can lead to uneven innovation efforts and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Therefore, governments need a balanced innovation portfolio that covers all innovation facets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

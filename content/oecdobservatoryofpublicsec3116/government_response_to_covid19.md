"Government Aftershock" is an event designed to help make sense of the extremely complicated context presented by the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Supported by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program and Microsoft, the event aims to explore how governments can adapt to a post-COVID-19 world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. It is part of a broader global conversation, with over 60 related events held worldwide, focusing on key questions such as:
*   What needs to be left behind from this crisis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
*   What should be kept? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   What should be done differently? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

This crisis has emphasized the vital role of the state and the need for strong public sector capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. It has demonstrated that governments can operate in more flexible ways, collaborating with the private sector and broader community, often due to a lack of other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The objective is to build a more flexible, anticipatory, and resilient state capable of facing future crises, both known (like the climate crisis) and known unknowns (like pandemics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Key Learnings from COVID-19 Response

### Speed and Societal Cooperation
Latvia's Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš highlighted two critical lessons:
1.  **Speed of reaction**: During the first wave of COVID-19, Latvia reacted very quickly, implementing restrictions before the first death in the country. This led to successfully flattening the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Decisions were made within approximately 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
2.  **Getting society to work with government**: Explaining the danger and the plan for addressing it, and inviting cooperation, led to extensive public cooperation and a huge success in reducing the first wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

However, the success of the first wave created difficulties for the second. Economic impacts, such as job losses and reduced wages, caused stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. When the second wave approached, there was more societal discussion about reaction speed and restrictions, leading to a slower response time of about three-and-a-half weeks to align government and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This delay resulted in a higher number of cases and deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. In societies valuing freedom and democracy, the challenge lies in convincing people to adhere to restrictions that require giving up some openness to protect health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The dialogue between government and society is crucial, as no government can go faster than society is willing to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Continuous informing of society is key for future preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Challenges and Adaptations
The COVID-19 crisis is an unprecedented health, social, and economic crisis, projected to cause a 4.5% fall in world GDP in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. While vaccines offer hope, living with the virus will be necessary for most of 2021 due to development, approval, production, and distribution challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

Governments have taken extraordinary and swift measures, including income support, expanded sick leaves, and directing trillions of dollars to support households and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. These [[innovative_government_responses_to_the_crisis | responses]] included:
*   Experimenting with better communication approaches with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>
*   Coordinating with communities in new ways during lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>
*   Massively shifting to remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>

The crisis has exacerbated underlying issues like inequalities, economic insecurity, uneven healthcare access, and a crisis of trust, inserting fear into the social fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.

### Importance of Trust and Digital Governance
A trusting relationship between people and their administration is pivotal for addressing societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. High trust leads to better compliance and results. For example, in 233 regions across 19 European countries, mobility for non-essential activities was significantly lower in high-trust regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. People's trust is influenced by government competence, integrity, openness, and fairness, as well as the reliability and responsiveness of service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of digital governance. Governments need to ensure the digital economy contributes to productivity and well-being, including necessary regulation for platform companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Furthermore, it underscored the fragility of communicating scientific evidence, as misinformation threatens policy efficacy, undermines trust, and amplifies fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Governments must fight misinformation by being more open and engaging directly with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

### Serbian Experience: Digitization and Economic Resilience
Serbia's Prime Minister Ana Brnabić shared how pre-pandemic investments in digitization proved crucial:
*   **E-government**: Full digitalization of government services allowed uninterrupted service provision to citizens and businesses, even during lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. This also helps fight corruption by making processes transparent and reducing physical contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.
*   **Digital education**: Investments enabled a seamless transition to online schooling, meaning not a single day of schooling was lost in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.
*   **Innovation-driven economy**: Shifting the economy from labor-intensive to innovation-driven and knowledge-based, with significant investment in the ICT sector (reaching 6% of GDP), made it more resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. This allowed Serbia to anticipate a smaller GDP decline (-1% to -0.7%) and maintain unemployment levels, even reducing youth unemployment through programs like "My First Salary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.
    *   The "My First Salary" program addresses the challenge of youth lacking work experience by having the government pay part of the salaries (at least 50%) for companies providing first jobs to youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. It is a fully digital, transparent, online application and matchmaking process utilizing artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.

Digitization also offers environmental benefits. In Serbia, going digital since June 2017 has saved 15,000 trees, 65 million liters of water, and 5,700 megawatts of electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.

## Preparing for the Next Crisis

### Shifting Paradigms
The recovery must be green, sustainable, inclusive (putting people first), and resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. Returning to the "normal" before the pandemic is not an option, as that normal was "not good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>. Decisions made today will affect the next 30-40 years, influencing technology, inclusion, and preparedness for future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
The crisis revealed that even countries considered best prepared were found unprepared and inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. However, many governments reacted very fast, doubling or tripling healthcare capacities, including beds, intensive care, ventilators, and staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. A key strength is for governments to embrace digital transformation, overcoming inherent bureaucracy to be available to citizens and businesses 24/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. The use of artificial intelligence in government could automate repetitive tasks, dramatically increasing productivity and efficiency, and facilitating services without physical contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

The pandemic has also highlighted issues like the problem of skills, particularly for lower-skilled individuals who face greater difficulty re-entering a more digital job market. Focus must be placed on digital education and skills for these groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.

The [[Government_Responses_to_COVID19_and_Innovation | government responses to COVID19 and innovation]] have been bold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. The crisis is the most global phenomenon faced, affecting every country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. Dealing with such a global issue requires global approaches, international cooperation, and a multilateral approach, similar to trade, investment, or climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. The global nature of the crisis demonstrates the importance of world cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.

The pandemic has also profoundly changed the perception of individual freedoms and civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. Mandatory mask-wearing, social distancing, and tracking applications raise complex questions about where personal freedom starts and stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. There is a need for public debate, involving humanities and social sciences experts, to guide governments on how to protect both public health and civil liberties in such circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. This tension is likely to be a worldwide problem even post-pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

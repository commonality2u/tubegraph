Gender-based violence (GBV) is a global pandemic, recognized by the OECD as a priority area within its agenda on gender equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. Even before recent crises, it was estimated that over one-third of women experienced some form of violence at least once in their lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this crisis worldwide, often referred to as a "shadow pandemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Rates of GBV significantly increased during periods of lockdowns, as many women and girls were confined with their abusers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

The pandemic has highlighted the critical need for governments to plan more strategically and act more proactively when addressing GBV, especially during times of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. No single agency can effectively deal with such complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

## OECD Framework and Pillars

The OECD has been actively working to [[integrating_missionoriented_approaches_in_government_and_policymaking | strengthen governance and survivor-centered approaches]] to eliminating GBV. This includes hosting global roundtables on access to justice and launching a Technical Advisory Group on GBV comprised of policy experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The group is finalizing an important framework built on three pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>:

1.  **Systems Approach:** Strong intersectional coordination and holistic legislation and policies are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
2.  **Cultural Change:** Ensuring survivor-centric responses and guaranteeing access to justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
3.  **Improving Accountability:** Essential for effective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

## Challenges During Crisis

Governments faced significant challenges in addressing GBV even before the pandemic, often struggling with a lack of resources and efficient methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. The pandemic intensified these issues, creating additional pressure within families due to factors like job loss and financial insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

A key difficulty during lockdowns was the inability to know precisely what was happening inside homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Victims often feared their perpetrators and worried about increasing family difficulties, or believed that domestic violence was no longer a priority for authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Initial governmental responses sometimes overlooked the victims of domestic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Reports also indicated not only an increase in the number of incidents but also in their severity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

## Strategies for a Whole-of-Government Approach

Effective governance of GBV requires a [[collaborative_efforts_in_public_health_governance | whole-of-society approach]], involving various actors beyond just government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

### Key Principles for Effective Response:

*   **Public Awareness and Political Will:** Governments must go public, declaring that domestic violence and child abuse will never be accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This includes establishing a zero-tolerance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. [[importance_of_data_communication_and_media_in_combating_genderbased_violence | Media plays a crucial role]] in informing the public that GBV remains a priority and that services are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Continuity and Accessibility of Services:** Essential GBV services, including counseling centers and shelters, must remain open and able to function, even during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Police forces must also remain available to intervene and enforce protective orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
*   **Flexible and Innovative Service Delivery:** Creativity and adaptability are needed to respond to changing circumstances, such as online consultations or alternative meeting places for survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. Governments should also make exceptions to curfew or quarantine restrictions for victims seeking help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   **[[incorporating_survivor_feedback_and_intersectionality_in_policy_making | Survivor-Centric Approach]]:** Services must be centered around the needs of survivors. Listening to survivors and using their experiences to improve existing services is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. Policies should also account for groups of women more likely to be subjected to violence, such as women with disabilities or migrant women, by ensuring helplines and information are accessible in multiple languages and formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.
*   **Data Collection and Analysis:** Robust, timely data is essential to understand the situation, identify specific needs, target efforts, and develop effective measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.
*   **Building on Proven Models:** Governments should leverage existing, effective models and strategies rather than reinventing the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
*   **Providing Hope:** Services should offer survivors hope for a better future and empower them to work towards it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

### Country-Specific Examples

#### Switzerland
Switzerland reacted quickly by establishing a national task force on violence, domestic violence, and COVID-19 in March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
*   **Coordination:** The task force ensured coordination between different services (police, shelters, counseling centers) and across all levels of government (national and local authorities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   **Monitoring:** It established a short-term information flow, collecting data weekly from various actors, including police, victim support services, and shelters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
*   **Public Information:** A poster campaign in 13 languages was launched with the help of professional organizations (groceries, pharmacies) to inform the public that domestic violence was still a priority and help was available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
*   **Increased Support:** Financial support was increased for helplines to manage the surge in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   **Data Challenges:** While phone calls to centers increased, Switzerland did not observe a general increase in police-reported domestic violence cases, highlighting the need for more nuanced data and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. The experience of the task force could be translated into a more permanent mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

#### Belgium
The European Family Justice Center Alliance promotes a model where professionals from different organizations work together under one roof to support GBV survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
*   **Adaptability:** The Family Justice Center in Antwerp rapidly transitioned its operations to a central and virtual coordination role during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. Existing multi-disciplinary cooperation provided a strong foundation for switching to online consultations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
*   **Alternative Housing:** The Belgian government quickly secured additional housing places, including hotels, for survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.
*   **Increased Reporting:** In areas with Family Justice Centers, there was an increase in reported cases, while other areas saw a decrease, suggesting the effectiveness of these integrated models in encouraging reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
*   **Shared Learning:** International collaboration with organizations like the Alliance for HOPE International in the U.S. allowed for weekly sharing of experiences and development of practical guidelines for professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.

#### Chile
Chile's Ministry of Women and Gender Equality adopted a contingency plan early in the pandemic, building on insights from other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.
*   **Service Continuity:** The plan prioritized securing the continuity of GBV services, ensuring 109 day centers and 45 shelters operated at full capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.
*   **Increased Capacity:** Resources for hotlines were increased, additional shifts were incorporated, and remote attention for day centers was provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.
*   **Cross-Government Coordination:** Chile activated its GBV coordination circuit, involving health providers, police, and public prosecutor's offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>. GBV-related services were declared essential, and restraining orders were automatically extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.
*   **New Communication Channels:** [[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_addressing_genderbased_violence | New silent helplines]] were developed, including a WhatsApp line, an online website, and alliances with pharmacies (which later transformed into information points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. SMS hotlines are also being developed to reach users without smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.
*   **Public Health Framing:** GBV information was included in daily national TV COVID-19 sanitary reports to highlight it as a public health issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. Media campaigns, such as "There is no place for violence in this community" and "Do it for her," promoted channels and reinforced collective responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.
*   **Participatory Approach:** A Council of Women on COVID was created with congresswomen and civil society representatives to develop measures addressing the pandemic's differentiated impact on women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.
*   **Territorial Reach:** Partnerships with the state bank (Banco Estado) leveraged its network of local banking shops to distribute GBV prevention information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>. The private sector is also engaged to prevent and detect GBV among employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.

## Future Directions and Lessons Learned

The pandemic has identified bottlenecks and gaps in GBV response systems, pushing for innovation, creativity, and flexibility in service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. Key takeaways for governments include:

*   **Permanent Coordination:** Existing coordination mechanisms should be strengthened to allow for rapid scaling during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.
*   **[[addressing_inequality_and_inclusion_in_governance | Inclusive Service Design]]:** Services must be accessible to all groups, regardless of age, disability, or migration status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
*   **Integrated Data Systems:** Developing single registries or platforms to unify relevant information can help avoid secondary victimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>.
*   **[[mainstreaming_behavioral_science_in_government | Behavioral Science Integration]]:** Using behavioral insights to challenge preconceived ideas and unconscious biases among first responders (police, prosecutors, judiciary) can improve service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>.
*   **Engaging Men and Boys:** Developing platforms and courses on positive masculinity can help prevent GBV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Governments should establish conditions for mutual learning and exchange of practices, recognizing that a "one size fits all" approach does not work, and adapting successful models to local contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>.
*   **Prioritization and Resources:** Overcoming the biggest barrier—insufficient commitment and prioritization by governments—is critical. This requires mainstreaming GBV across all decision-making processes and ensuring sufficient capacities and resources for service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

Ultimately, the fundamental purpose of government is to serve the people, especially those in vulnerable situations. By listening to survivors and making informed choices, governments can develop effective and survivor-centric responses to GBV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

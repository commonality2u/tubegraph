Strategic foresight is defined by the OECD as the ability to constantly perceive, make sense of, and act on the future in the present [00:00:40][00:00:50]. Its primary purpose is not to predict the future, but to enable better decision-making today [00:00:58][00:01:03]. An analogy used is checking a weather forecast to decide whether to take an umbrella [00:01:09].

## Core Benefits and Characteristics
Strategic foresight utilizes various products, such as forecasting and [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight|scenarios]], to help organizations make better-prepared decisions, stress-test innovative solutions, and future-proof current actions [00:01:31][00:01:41].

Key benefits include:
*   Providing a structured, participatory, inclusive, impactful, and systemic approach to understanding future changes [00:01:58][00:02:00][00:02:03][00:02:06][00:02:09].
*   Dealing with medium to long-term futures, though in volatile fields like Artificial Intelligence, the medium-term future can be a matter of months [00:02:12][00:02:24][00:02:27]. During the COVID-19 crisis, prediction models were only precise for weeks, necessitating [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight|scenario]] approaches due to high uncertainty [00:02:32][00:02:50][00:02:52].
*   Assisting with priority setting, steering policies, and defining long-term objectives and strategy [00:02:54][00:02:58][00:03:01].
*   Identifying challenges and opportunities [00:03:04].
*   Guiding investment in innovative solutions [00:03:09].
*   Stress-testing current decisions, policies, and approaches to future-proof them [00:03:16][00:03:23].
*   Helping to build shared visions and success stories [00:03:28][00:03:31].
*   Encompassing a variety of methods and capabilities, moving from forecasting and predicting to anticipating and exploring future ideas for better decisions [00:03:33][00:03:42][00:03:44][00:03:46][00:03:49].

## Integrating Strategic Foresight into Government Organizations

Several governments and organizations are actively working to integrate strategic foresight into their systems:

### OECD and Flanders Collaboration
The OECD, with its Innovation lead, collaborates with innovative and anticipatory governments, including Flanders [00:00:12][00:00:20][00:00:32]. Their joint work focuses on integrating strategic foresight into government systems [00:00:35]. The OECD is developing anticipatory good practice principles to help build governance systems that allow for the most effective use of strategic foresight [00:04:08][00:04:12]. This includes engaging with uncertainty, ensuring continuity across policy cycles, and leveraging strategic foresight for [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation|transformative innovation]] [00:04:27][00:04:30][00:04:32][00:04:34].

The collaboration with the Government of Flanders, spanning over two years, involved an assessment of Flanders' strategic foresight system and the creation of a blueprint to embed strategic foresight from a multi-level perspective [00:04:55][00:05:05][00:05:16][00:05:21][00:05:24][00:07:02][00:21:25][00:21:27]. The blueprint provides an overview of key foundations for embedding foresight within government and strategic drivers for improvement [00:21:36][00:22:03][00:22:08][00:22:11].

### Four Functions of Strategic Foresight
The Government of Flanders, in collaboration with the OECD, has defined four core functions for strategic foresight that help explain the practice and identify opportunities for improvement [00:12:19][00:12:22][00:12:25][00:12:30][00:12:38]:

1.  **Discover**: Involves trend and weak signal analysis. Requires dedicated time and skilled personnel with a mandate for discovery [00:12:41][00:12:45][00:13:01][00:13:21][00:13:26].
2.  **Explore**: Making sense of insights gained from discovery through horizon scanning, pattern analysis, and system analysis. This also includes engaging with the science community via science-to-policy dialogues [00:13:35][00:13:37][00:13:40][00:13:42][00:13:45][00:13:47][00:13:50][00:13:54][00:13:57][00:14:00][00:14:03].
3.  **Map**: Linking anticipatory intelligence with current policymaking by identifying opportunities and challenges. This includes building [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight|explorative scenarios]], using tools like Futures Wheels, and mapping resilient indicators [00:14:29][00:14:31][00:14:40][00:14:46][00:14:55][00:14:58][00:15:00][00:15:03][00:15:05][00:15:11]. Resilient indicators use statistical data to understand future potential, focusing on capabilities and weaknesses [00:15:13][00:15:17][00:15:21][00:15:24][00:15:26][00:15:29][00:15:32][00:15:35][00:15:39][00:15:41].
4.  **Create**: Focuses on impact and scale by translating insights into visions, roadmaps, and coalitions for the future. It emphasizes government collaboration with stakeholders to ensure recovery and resilience, especially during crises [00:16:15][00:16:17][00:16:19][00:16:22][00:16:25][00:16:28][00:16:30][00:16:32][00:16:34][00:16:37][00:16:40][00:16:42][00:16:47][00:16:50][00:16:53][00:16:55].

### Finland's Proactive Governance
Finland has a comprehensive system of strategic foresight assets, including a Committee for the Future in Parliament, a strategic foresight team in the Prime Minister's Office, and various research institutes focusing on sector-specific foresight [00:42:42][00:43:01][00:43:06][00:43:16][00:43:19][00:43:22][00:44:15][00:44:17][00:44:19]. Despite these assets, an OECD assessment identified an "impact gap" in integrating these activities into core government processes [00:44:30][00:44:32][00:44:38][00:44:40][00:44:42].

To address this, Finland focuses on [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_government_organizations|integrating strategic foresight into everyday policy cycles]] [00:45:01][00:45:04]. This involves continuous dialogue between foresight specialists, policymakers, civil servants, and decision-makers to inform strategic decisions, leading to policy coherence, effective budgeting, improved management, and impactful innovation [00:45:10][00:45:13][00:45:17][00:45:19][00:45:21][00:45:25][00:45:27][00:45:30][00:45:33][00:45:36][00:45:38][00:45:40][00:45:43][00:45:51][00:45:54][00:45:57][00:45:59][00:46:02][00:46:05][00:46:09][00:46:12].

### Estonia's Evidence-Informed Policymaking
The Estonian Parliament's Foresight Center works to inform the public and Parliament about alternative [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight|scenarios]], future risks, and opportunities [00:48:14][00:48:17][00:48:20][00:48:27][00:48:29][00:48:32]. Their work plan is informed by topics proposed by Parliament members to ensure relevance [00:49:02][00:49:06][00:49:08][00:49:11].

For [[evidenceinformed_policymaking_using_strategic_foresight|evidence-informed policymaking]], the Foresight Center ensures impact by:
*   Having Parliament members convey and debate their messages, thereby influencing ministries [00:49:41][00:49:44][00:49:46][00:49:49][00:49:53][00:49:57][00:50:02][00:50:05][00:50:07].
*   Involving ministries directly through steering committees for each topic [00:50:38][00:50:42][00:50:44][00:50:47][00:50:50][00:50:52][00:50:55].
*   Proactively using media to amplify messages, as MPs tend to take insights from media more seriously [00:51:09][00:51:12][00:51:16][00:51:20][00:51:25][00:51:28][00:51:33][00:51:35][00:51:38][00:51:41][00:51:44][00:51:46][00:51:49][00:51:54].
*   Combining foresight methods with traditional analysis to provide quantitative data, including hypothetical simulations and budgetary impact calculations, to engage MPs [00:52:03][00:52:05][00:52:07][00:52:10][00:52:13][00:52:16][00:52:19][00:52:22][00:52:26][00:52:32][00:52:35][00:52:37][00:52:39][00:52:40][00:52:45][00:52:49][00:52:52][00:52:55][00:52:57][00:53:00][00:53:04][00:53:08][00:53:11][00:53:17][00:53:19][00:53:23][00:53:25][00:53:26][00:53:30][00:53:32][00:53:35][00:53:37][00:53:39][00:53:41][00:53:44][00:53:47].

### Wales' Legislative Approach to Futures
Wales has a unique approach to futures and foresight, stemming from the Well-being of Future Generations Act 2015 [00:56:34][00:56:38][00:56:41][00:56:44][00:56:46][00:56:48][00:56:51]. This legislation created national well-being goals, legal duties, an independent Future Generations Commissioner, and mandates the publication of a Future Trends Report [00:56:53][00:56:56][00:57:00][00:57:02][00:57:05]. It also defined "long-term" as one of five essential ways of working for sustainability [00:57:07][00:57:10][00:57:13]. The Future Trends Report and the long-term way of working provide legislative mechanisms for long-term planning, futures, and foresight [00:57:19][00:57:21][00:57:25][00:57:27].

In practice, Wales integrates foresight into existing systems and processes, identifying logical entry points:
*   **Impact Assessment**: A central part of the process when public money is spent [00:59:31][00:59:34].
*   **Procurement and Grants**: Include an appraisal of how the long-term has been considered [00:59:38][00:59:41][00:59:43].
*   **Corporate Learning and Development**: Training is provided to all civil servants [00:59:46][00:59:48][00:59:50][00:59:52].
*   **Place-Specific Plans**: Each region produces its own plan addressing likely future trends [00:59:55][00:59:58][01:00:01].
*   **Go-to Hub**: A small dedicated team provides advice and empowers colleagues to use foresight tools [01:00:03][01:00:06][01:00:07][01:00:10][01:00:13].

This integration shifts key government strategies toward a longer-term picture, influencing areas like transport, national development, and waste management [01:00:35][01:00:37][01:00:38][01:00:41][01:00:43][01:00:45][01:00:48][01:00:50][01:00:52]. Wales also emphasizes harnessing networks to maximize influence and impact, developing a Wales Futures Hub across the public service to pool resources and diversify perspectives [01:01:28][01:01:32][01:01:34][01:01:37][01:01:39][01:01:41][01:01:44][01:01:46][01:01:49][01:01:52][01:01:54].

### Nesta: Strategic Foresight for Transformative Innovation
Nesta, the UK's Innovation Agency for social good, uses strategic foresight to inform [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation|transformative innovation]] to achieve its missions in education, health, and sustainability with targets for 2030 [01:04:00][01:04:02][01:04:05][01:04:17][01:04:22][01:04:28][01:04:30][01:04:33][01:04:35][01:04:39][01:04:42][01:04:44][01:04:46][01:04:48]. The Discovery team, embedded in Nesta's strategy department, helps colleagues think beyond 2030 and anticipate changes [01:04:53][01:04:56][01:04:59][01:05:02][01:05:04][01:05:06][01:05:09][01:05:11].

Nesta supports teams through various activities:
*   **Horizon Scanning**: To understand the impact of emerging technology and social change on strategy, e.g., Future Signals series and "Minister for the Future" essay series [01:05:17][01:05:20][01:05:22][01:05:24][01:05:26][01:05:28][01:05:31][01:05:33][01:05:35][01:05:36][01:05:39][01:05:42][01:05:44][01:05:46].
*   **Stress Testing Ideas**: Answering big questions for mission colleagues and exploring innovative international policies [01:05:51][01:05:54][01:05:56][01:05:59][01:06:02][01:06:04][01:06:06][01:06:10][01:06:12][01:06:14][01:06:17][01:06:20][01:06:22].
*   **Developing Novel Approaches**: Blending traditional foresight techniques with data science, qualitative research, and design (e.g., Innovation Sweet Spots program combining foresight with open data) [01:06:24][01:06:27][01:06:28][01:06:30][01:06:32][01:06:35][01:06:38][01:06:39][01:06:42][01:06:44][01:06:48][01:06:49].
*   **Speculating and Prototyping**: Exploring potential applications of new technologies, such as generative AI in early years education (e.g., activity generator) [01:06:54][01:06:57][01:06:59][01:07:01][01:07:04][01:07:06][01:07:08][01:07:11][01:07:13][01:07:15][01:07:17]. Also explores future uses of infrastructure like the UK's gas grid [01:07:20][01:07:22][01:07:24][01:07:27].
*   **Exposing Staff to New Ideas**: Bringing in external perspectives and practices to inspire staff and challenge assumptions, such as Discovery Month on generative AI or expert residencies [01:07:39][01:07:42][01:07:44][01:07:46][01:07:48][01:07:50][01:07:53][01:07:55][01:07:59][01:08:01][01:08:04][01:08:07][01:08:09][01:08:11].
*   **Creating Space for Exploration**: Designing programs like sabbaticals and "Explorations Week" to allow staff time for experimental, self-directed work and learning [01:08:15][01:08:17][01:08:20][01:08:23][01:08:25][01:08:27][01:08:29][01:08:30][01:08:33][01:08:34][01:08:37][01:08:39][01:08:41][01:08:43].

These efforts have resulted in Nesta's colleagues becoming more confident with uncertainty, bolder in their ideas, and more comfortable with failure [01:08:59][01:09:00][01:09:02][01:09:04][01:09:06].

## Challenges and Solutions in Foresight Implementation
Implementing strategic foresight faces several common challenges, but also offers pathways for solutions:

### Common Barriers
Audience participation in a live poll highlighted major barriers [00:26:31][00:26:33]:
*   **Time**: A significant recurring issue [00:26:48][00:27:31].
*   **Silos**: Organizational silos hinder cross-collaboration [00:26:48].
*   **Workload**: Existing heavy workloads limit capacity for foresight [00:26:53][00:26:48].
*   **Budget/Resources/Capacity**: Financial and human resource constraints are critical [00:26:53][00:27:14][00:27:34].
*   **Short-term Thinking**: A pervasive challenge in policy and decision-making [00:26:57].
*   **Lack of Understanding/Buy-in**: Difficulties in conveying the value of foresight and securing support from decision-makers [00:27:34][02:29:04][02:29:50].
*   **Overwhelm/Training**: The complexity and novelty of foresight can be overwhelming, and training is often needed [00:27:00][02:27:04][02:27:07].

### Enabling Factors and Solutions
*   **Ecosystems Approach**: Fostering a healthy ecosystem where supply and demand for foresight nurture each other, rather than relying on a single "super team" [01:13:42][01:13:44][01:13:46][01:13:49][01:13:51][01:13:54][01:13:56]. This involves thinking in terms of culture and behavior, processes, structures, and people [01:14:02][01:14:04][01:14:06].
*   **Institutionalization**: Moving foresight from fragmented project-based initiatives to a more structural mandate within government is a major challenge [02:24:20][02:24:25][02:24:28][02:24:31][02:24:33][02:24:36].
*   **Clear Expectation Management**: Clearly defining principles, activities, and outputs of foresight from the start and throughout the process [02:22:50][02:22:54][02:22:57][02:23:00][02:23:03][02:23:07][02:23:08][02:23:12][02:23:14][02:23:17][02:23:20][02:23:24][02:23:27][02:23:30][02:23:33][02:23:36][02:23:38][02:23:41][02:23:44].
*   **Balanced Internal and External Capacity**: Ensuring sufficient internal capacity for designing projects and collaborating on initiatives, even while engaging with external partners [02:23:50][02:23:52][02:23:55][02:23:58][02:24:01][02:24:03][02:24:07][02:24:10][02:24:12][02:24:14].
*   **Tailoring Products for Audiences**: Curating foresight products (infographics, summaries, evidence packs, figures, stories) for different audiences to maximize persuasion and usability [00:58:04][00:58:06][00:58:08][00:58:10][00:58:14][00:58:17][00:58:19][00:58:22].
*   **Involving Stakeholders**: Engaging a wide array of stakeholders, including young researchers, parliament, technology institutes, citizens, decision-makers, and academia [02:30:19][02:30:24][02:30:29][02:30:34][02:30:36][02:30:39][02:30:45][02:30:51][02:30:55][02:31:00][02:31:03][02:31:05][02:31:08][02:31:10]. Foresight by definition involves crossing boundaries of time, policy domains, and actors [00:09:38][00:09:42][00:09:44][00:09:46][00:09:48][00:09:50][00:09:53][00:09:57][01:00:00][01:00:03][01:00:07][01:00:10][01:00:12][01:00:15][01:00:19][01:00:22][01:00:26][01:00:30][01:00:33][01:00:37][01:00:39][01:00:42][01:00:45][01:00:47][01:00:50].
*   **Getting Involved**: The most important thing is to get colleagues involved in using foresight tools, even on hypothetical topics, to demonstrate their value [01:16:14][01:16:17][01:16:19][01:16:20][01:16:22][01:16:24][01:16:27][01:16:28][01:16:31][01:16:32][01:16:34].

## Measuring Impact
Measuring the impact of strategic foresight can be challenging, as there are no clear-cut metrics [01:19:46][01:19:47][01:19:50][01:20:00][01:20:10][01:20:14][01:20:31][01:20:35][01:20:37]. However, impact can be observed through:
*   **Message Spread**: How widely the foresight message has spread among policy designers and in public discussion [01:20:42][01:20:44][01:20:47][01:20:50][01:20:55][01:20:57][01:21:00].
*   **Realization and Action**: When key policy designers or the public realize an issue and understand the need to act, particularly when foresight indicates a crucial intervention point [01:21:02][01:21:05][01:21:33][01:21:36][01:21:39][01:21:42][01:21:47][01:21:50][01:21:53][01:21:55][01:21:58].
*   **Milestones and Thresholds**: Setting quantitative or qualitative milestones, such as a certain number of key persons realizing an issue and needing to act [01:22:01][01:22:04][01:22:09][01:22:13][01:22:16][01:22:19][01:22:21][01:22:25].
*   **Policy Coherence**: Foresight contributes to more consistent policy decisions [00:45:54].
*   **Tangible Changes in Strategy**: Seeing key government strategies shifting their focus to the longer term, rather than remaining mere ambitions [01:00:35][01:17:22][01:17:24][01:17:27][01:17:29]. This involves setting sensible milestones and having robust governance (e.g., project boards) to regularly discuss progress [01:17:50][01:18:00][01:18:02][01:18:05][01:18:07][01:18:08][01:18:10][01:18:31][01:18:34][01:18:36][01:18:38][01:18:41][01:18:44][01:18:47][01:18:50]. Flexibility is also crucial, as conditions can change rapidly [01:18:54][01:18:56][01:18:58][01:19:00][01:19:03][01:19:06][01:19:08][01:19:11].

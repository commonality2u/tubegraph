The COVID-19 pandemic significantly highlighted the crucial importance of public trust for effective public policies, as well as how public services themselves adapted during the crisis, often leveraging digital technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This period showcased both the immense opportunities and significant challenges posed by [[digitalization of government services | digitalization]] and social media in public services.

## Opportunities of Digitalization

[[digitalization_of_government_services | Digitalization]] has proven to be a powerful tool for public services, offering numerous benefits:
*   **Efficiency in Crisis Response** Public services were able to adapt rapidly during the pandemic, for example, by quickly distributing benefits to those out of jobs through [[digital tools for communication in public services | digital systems]] of state revenue services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
*   **Government Transformation** Governments can become fully digital very quickly, as seen with online meetings, voting, and systems for designing new legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Citizen Engagement** [[digitalization_of_government_services | Digitalization]] has the potential to incorporate citizens into political discussions, offering a low-cost way for participation compared to traditional methods that demand more time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

## Challenges and Risks

Despite the benefits, the increased reliance on [[digital tools for communication in public services | digital tools]] and social media presents several challenges:
*   **Increased Distance and Gaps** [[digitalization_of_government_services | Digitalization]] can inadvertently create a gap between citizens and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, especially if not designed inclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.
*   **Misinformation and Polarization** Social media plays a significant role in spreading misinformation and fostering polarization within societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>, making it difficult for governments to distinguish between freedom of speech and the spread of fake stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.
*   **"Government Reality Show"** Excessive transparency or over-engagement on social media during a crisis can lead to decision-making appearing more like a "reality show" than a fact-based discussion, with statements and anecdotal stories replacing arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.
*   **Reactive Policy-Making** Over-reliance on social media input can lead to governments developing policies that are reactive rather than proactive and strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.
*   **Reproducing Inequalities** [[digitalization_of_government_services | Digitalization]] can reproduce existing inequalities, as groups normally less represented in politics (e.g., women, immigrants, elderly, indigenous people) are also often less active in online tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.

## Strategies for Building Trust and Inclusivity

To navigate these challenges and build trust in an increasingly digital world, several strategies are crucial:
*   **Clear and Timely Communication** Governments that communicate timely and clearly, even when delivering difficult news, tend to see higher levels of citizen compliance and increased trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. Simplicity in communication is also key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
*   **Local Level Engagement** The local level is fundamental for building trust and includes communities that may not be included nationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. Working with local leaders and community-based policies can foster community trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, which in turn enhances trust in different levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Humble and Flexible Governance** Governments should adopt a "humble government" approach, acknowledging what they don't know and being willing to ask for help from citizens and other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. This requires flexibility and a willingness to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>.
*   **Design Thinking in Policy-Making** Utilizing design thinking in policy-making helps capture the diversity of social groups by designing processes around the people who use and serve the policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. This involves including all stakeholders at the table, fostering a sense of being heard and co-designing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>.
*   **Empowering Public Employees** Changing how governments operate internally, by empowering public employees and giving them ownership, can transform how they connect with citizens and deliver services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.
*   **Continuous Feedback and Adaptation** Rather than creating a service and then presenting it to citizens, there should be a continuous process of collecting feedback and adapting the service based on user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. Citizens need to feel their voices are heard and represented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.
*   **Diverse Participation Mechanisms** Recognizing that citizens have different levels of desire to participate, institutions should offer diverse participation mechanisms that are simple enough to encourage engagement from a broad range of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.
*   **Developing New Skills for Public Servants** Public servants need a broader skill set beyond traditional policy cycles, including expertise in big data analysis, ethnographic interviews, user experience design, and quick survey tools to effectively interact with citizens and communities in new ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

In the post-pandemic recovery, it is crucial to avoid returning to old ways and instead embed the lessons learned. The key challenges identified are reaching forgotten groups and a perceived lack of vision and leadership to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Building more inclusive public policy tools and institutions is not only a basis for better services but also empowers people, strengthening public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.

## Tools and Experiences for the Future

Some specific tools and experiences highlighted for future adoption include:
*   **"One plus two plus four" Discussion Method:** This facilitation technique allows participants to think alone, then discuss in pairs, and finally in larger groups. It ensures opinions are heard and valued, fostering deeper participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **Empathy Maps:** Asking different stakeholder groups to describe what they think others think about them can reveal surprising perceptions and serve as a turning point in discussions, building empathy and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

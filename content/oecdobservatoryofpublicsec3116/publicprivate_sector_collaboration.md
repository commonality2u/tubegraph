[[public_sector_innovation | Innovation in public administration]] is a crucial topic, often relying on real-world case studies and projects [00:00:23]. While public administrations are frequently perceived as bureaucratic and hierarchical, they can also be highly innovative [00:08:27]. This paradox highlights the importance of [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation | public and private collaboration in innovation]] to address complex challenges [00:08:48].

## LabX: Fostering Innovation in Portugal
LabX, an experimental project launched in 2017 and supported by the Portuguese government, aims to foster [[public_sector_innovation | innovation in public sector]] organizations [00:09:07]. It was designed as an open and safe space to experiment and promote innovative solutions, focusing on citizens' and businesses' needs [00:09:33]. LabX tests solutions before full implementation to learn from mistakes and reduce risks and costs [00:09:56].

The project's objectives include creating a network of innovators, designing new public services, and engaging citizens [00:07:03]. Initially an experimentation lab, LabX has evolved into an ambitious center for promoting [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] [00:10:17]. Despite historical and regulatory challenges, LabX has worked to change the public sector mindset and root strategic thinking [00:11:30]. It also aims to foster capacity building in public servants, spread good practices, engage the community, and tackle organizational silos [00:11:49].

LabX serves as an incubator for designing, testing, and improving innovative projects in public administration [00:12:31]. These projects can be proposed by public servants, public managers, universities, research centers, private companies, or the social sector, demonstrating that [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation | innovation]] can originate from various sources [00:12:41]. Since 2017, LabX has completed 25 experimental projects, engaging over 10,000 citizens and more than 2,000 public servants across 160+ public sector organizations [00:13:17]. A significant portion of this work focuses on public service design to improve access to increasingly digital public services, emphasizing co-creation and prototyping [00:13:49].

Key to LabX's success is fostering experimentation, showing that testing and learning from experiences is beneficial [00:22:06]. This has led to the emergence of "microlabs" within public administration and strong interest from local governments in having their own experimentation labs [00:22:42]. LabX also provides support, offering methodologies, knowledge sharing, and tailored project assistance [00:23:16].

A crucial policy measure in Portugal, related to LabX's work, is the "right to challenge" [01:06:48]. This allows public sector teams to request temporary removal of regulatory barriers to test new ways of doing things, encouraging personal engagement in the innovation process [01:07:12]. Strong political sponsorship has been vital for LabX's sustainability and expansion [01:26:28].

## Gov Buys Innovation: A Marketplace for Solutions in Belgium
The Gov Buys Innovation initiative, led by NedO in Belgium, addresses the need for governments to evolve and modernize while managing spending challenges [00:30:05]. It seeks to change how government spending occurs to increase the value of tax money [00:30:18].

Traditionally, the public sector often works with large companies for new technologies, leading to high costs, slow implementation, and sometimes undesired outcomes [00:30:51]. This project addresses obstacles faced by civil servants and new, innovative companies [00:30:39].

Gov Buys Innovation creates a marketplace where the public sector and innovative companies can dialogue, understand each other's challenges and solutions, and collaborate free from common obstacles [00:32:34]. It provides civil servants with the tools and autonomy to solve problems differently through market consultation and experimentation [00:32:50].

This project is not a new procurement platform but integrates procurement processes to make the platform work [00:33:23]. NedO guides stakeholders, providing expertise and procedures to work with innovative companies [00:33:47]. The long-term aim is for stakeholders to use the platform autonomously [00:34:04].

> "Gov buys innovation is the marketplace where the public sector shows transparency and and reveals its challenges. At the same time companies can showcase their innovative solutions and inspire civil servants with possibilities they honestly often didn't know they existed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>

The initiative focuses on real problems and needs [00:35:01]. Challenges include market consultation to find new solutions and experimentation with promising ideas [00:34:32]. An example is an experiment with the emergency number 112 to gain insight into the nature of calls and prioritize them, especially after events like flooding [00:35:25].

To support [[private_sector_innovation | private sector innovation]] and encourage [[publicprivate_partnerships_in_technology_and_innovation | public-private partnerships]], governments should:
*   Publish problem statements and allow companies to propose solutions [00:41:03].
*   Reduce administrative burdens for smaller, innovative companies [00:41:48].
*   Be accessible for questions and transparent throughout procedures [00:42:07].
*   Dialogue and provide constant, meaningful feedback after each step of a challenge [00:42:21].
*   Pay companies in a timely manner [00:42:53].
*   Engage with incubators that group innovative companies [00:43:11].
*   Focus on criteria that solve problems, assess success potential, and evaluate team motivation, rather than just cost [00:43:27].
*   Work with experiments, allowing for testing and potential failure [00:44:06].
*   Share successes and failures to inspire others and tackle prejudices [00:44:22].

Gov Buys Innovation builds a broader ecosystem where diverse competencies are brought together in the [[public_sector_innovation | innovation process]] [00:37:31]. The expertise of NedO lies in creating [[collaboration_between_government_and_industry | cooperation between civil servants]], who understand problems, and innovative companies, who deliver solutions [00:37:41].

## Partnership for Change: Employee Exchange in Slovenia
Slovenia's "Partnership for Change" program focuses on the exchange of employees and the transfer of good practices between the public and [[private_sector_innovation | private sector]] [00:45:32]. Initiated spontaneously in 2015 by the former Minister, it aimed to break stereotypes about the differences between the two sectors [00:47:05].

The program involves a voluntary, maximum five-day exchange based on participants' interests [00:48:52]. Candidates submit a letter of motivation, and connections are facilitated between relevant organizations [00:49:23]. Over 300 employees have participated in exchanges [00:48:40]. The process is kept simple and non-bureaucratic to ensure smooth operation [00:50:25].

This program offers "training on the field," allowing employees to learn how concepts like project management are implemented in real environments [00:51:08]. Private sector employees, conversely, are interested in understanding how public sector strategies, tenders, and e-services are developed [00:51:26].

A key added value is fostering mutual understanding and building trust between the public and [[private_sector_innovation | private sector]] [00:52:12]. This leads to larger networks and easier future [[collaboration_between_government_and_industry | collaboration]] [00:52:28]. The program started at the ministerial level but expanded to include exchanges within the public sector itself and at the local level [00:53:06].

The program also senses and leverages energy from both sides to collaborate on solving challenges [00:53:32]. Annual competitions gather diverse challenges from NGOs, academia, public services, and the [[private_sector_innovation | private sector]] [00:54:07]. Examples include raising awareness for e-invoices in schools to save paper, designing e-taxes business applications via hackathons, and matching student skills to labor market needs [00:54:37].

Partnership for Change proves that [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation | collaboration]] is possible by breaking barriers and creating positive stories together [00:55:32]. The program has established a platform for [[public_sector_innovation and crosssector_collaboration | collaboration]], experimenting, and prototyping [00:59:41]. It provides a safe way of experimenting because of its voluntary nature and interest-driven approach [00:59:02].

The Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] at the OECD has developed a new model for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] that identifies four distinct types of [[innovation in government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04"></a>. This model suggests that different types of [[innovation in government | innovation]] require different activities and support systems, necessitating varied [[strategies for fostering government innovation | strategies]] to promote them within countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44"></a>.

## Four Types of Government Innovation
The model outlines four types of [[innovation in government | innovation]]:
*   Mission-oriented [[innovation in government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16"></a>
*   Adaptive [[innovation in government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19"></a>
*   Anticipatory [[innovation in government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19"></a>
*   [[enhancement_oriented_innovation_in_government | Enhancement-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21"></a>

These categories are based on two key variables:
1.  Having a clear purpose or direction for innovation versus a discovery process being the core variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27"></a>.
2.  The level of uncertainty or certainty associated with the innovation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35"></a>.

## Innovation Portfolios
Governments are encouraged to develop [[innovation in government | innovation]] portfolios that encompass and balance all these different types of [[innovation in government | innovation]] in a way that aligns with their future goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56"></a>.

## Tailored Strategies for Each Innovation Type
Different types of [[innovation in government | innovation]] demand specific [[strategies for fostering government innovation | strategies]] and support systems:
*   **Anticipatory [[innovation in government | innovation]]** requires significantly more autonomy than [[enhancement_oriented_innovation_in_government | enhancement-oriented innovation]] because anticipating future technological developments often challenges the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16"></a>.
*   **Mission-oriented [[innovation in government | innovation]]** necessitates clear goals and targets to enable individuals to collaborate across silos effectively and achieve governmental objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32"></a>.
*   **Adaptive [[innovation in government | innovation]]** requires a "license to generate" at the outset, encouraging exploration and the discovery of new ideas that could benefit the government or transform the system entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41"></a>.

The Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] plans to further engage with governments on how to manage these [[innovation in government | innovation]] portfolios effectively, seeking feedback on the different types of [[innovation in government | innovation]] and portfolio management to help governments create, manage, and steward these [[strategies for fostering government innovation | strategies]] for optimal citizen solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57"></a>.

Gamification is increasingly being applied in public policy to engage citizens and influence behavior, often in conjunction with [[behavioral_insights_for_public_policy | behavioral insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This represents a maturing trend that has moved beyond traditional "post-it based workshops" towards more innovative applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Key Aspects

Gamification in public policy involves using game-like elements and design principles in non-game contexts to encourage desired behaviors and achieve policy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Integration with Behavioral Insights
A significant development is the merger of gamification with [[behavioral_insights_for_public_policy | behavioral insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. While [[behavioral_insights_in_government | behavioral insights]] activities, also known as "nudges," have seen growth in governments to understand human motivations for actions like paying taxes on time or contributing to retirement accounts, gamification offers new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Governments are using [[behavioral_insights_in_government | behavioral insights]] to understand human motivations and nudge them toward actions such as paying taxes on time or contributing more to retirement accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Over 200 government-related [[behavioral_insights_in_government | behavioral insights]] units have emerged in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Moving Beyond Traditional Workshops
Innovation organizations and governments are developing "serious games" and other gamification methods to move past workshop fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. An example is the European Commission's scenario exploration system, which helps users develop future journeys and scenarios through role-playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Several dozen such games are available on the OECD's OPSI toolkit navigator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Case Study: Carrot Rewards (Canada)
Carrot Rewards, the winner of the Edge of Government Award, is a prime example of combining gamification and [[behavioral_public_policy | behavioral insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This national wellness rewards platform was developed by the Government of Canada in partnership with Carrot Insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### Problem Addressed
The initiative aimed to address the unsustainable rise in healthcare costs in Canada by improving the wellness and wellbeing of Canadian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

### How it Works
Users earn points by engaging in healthy behaviors, such as setting and meeting walking goals or completing quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. These points can then be redeemed for rewards through various loyalty programs, like flights or gift cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This approach was particularly well-suited to the Canadian market, where approximately 90% of citizens are subscribed to loyalty programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

### Impact and Collaborations
The Carrot Rewards app has seen significant popularity and has collaborated with various health campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. For instance, in partnership with a flu campaign, the app sent push notifications and offered geo-localization quizzes to help users find the nearest pharmacy for a flu shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. This campaign led to 30,000 people getting their flu shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

At the Edge of Government experience, the Carrot Rewards application was physically built out, allowing attendees to walk around and have their steps calculated, earning hypothetical points redeemable for loyalty programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

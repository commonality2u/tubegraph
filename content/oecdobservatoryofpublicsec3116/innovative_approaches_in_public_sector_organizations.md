The discussion highlights the journey, challenges, and success factors in fostering a culture of [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]].

## Webinar Overview
On the topic of "Making Innovative Public Sector Organizations," a webinar was held featuring Michael Trogir from IP Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This event was part of Innovation Month 2024, hosted by Australia's public sector innovation network, focusing on the theme "Delivering Differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

The audience for the webinar primarily consisted of government employees, with participants joining from Australia, Europe, and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:01">[02:03:01]</a>. Polling indicated that many organizations agreed they were innovative, though few strongly agreed, and a significant number felt their organizations had a deliberate and explicit approach to [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:08">[04:08:08]</a>. Key interests from the audience included innovating in a risk-averse environment, involving staff, leadership, success stories, engaging older staff, key [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | challenges]] in the public sector, building an [[innovative_culture | innovative culture]], pushing through red tape, and external stakeholder engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:11">[06:11:11]</a>.

## IP Australia's Innovation Journey
The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) at the OECD focuses on uncovering what's next, turning new practices into the norm, and providing trusted advice to governments on consistent approaches to [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. IP Australia serves as a strong example of an organization with a deliberate and explicit approach to [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

### About IP Australia
IP Australia is the Australian government agency responsible for issuing intellectual property (IP) rights, including patents, trademarks, designs, and plant breeder's rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. They promote awareness of IP rights and contribute to government advice on the [[innovation_system | innovation system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. A key factor in their [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] journey is their financial independence as a cost-recovered agency, funding operations and investments through fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

### Milestones and Drivers
IP Australia's [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] journey significantly began around eight years prior to the discussion, heavily influenced by former Director-General Patricia Kelly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. A capability review of the organization suggested an increase in their culture and embrace of [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. The leadership team championed this approach, which provided crucial momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. This focus aligned with the importance of [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] for Australia's economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

Early steps included:
*   **Establishment of the Office of the Chief Economist (2012):** This built economic expertise and data analysis, improving decision-making and contributing to the national [[innovation_discussion | innovation discussion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
*   **Proactive Engagement:** The agency became more confident in proactively defining and engaging with what [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] meant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Staff Empowerment:** Staff were encouraged to contribute ideas, fostering a multi-directional approach to [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] and encouraging risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Budget:** A small percentage (less than 1%) of the annual budget was explicitly dedicated to experimentation, technology, and ideas, accepting that not all initiatives would succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

The organization leveraged the capability review as a platform for change, driven by a clear strategic choice from leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. This involved establishing a clear "Roadmap to 2030," published and incorporated into their annual corporate plan, with ambitious goals structured across three horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. This roadmap, which included operational excellence, service excellence, and value-added objectives, compelled the agency to take risks to achieve its long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

### Examples of Innovation
IP Australia has implemented several [[Impact of innovation in the public sector | innovative practices]] that demonstrate its commitment to [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]]:

*   **Trademark Search (February 2017):** This revolutionary tool combined image searching and machine learning to simplify trademark searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Users could upload logos instead of text descriptions, receiving instant results from over 400,000 images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. This reduced application rejections, saved businesses time, and resulted in a 54% reduction in trademark search-related calls to their call center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. The project involved close collaboration with a private sector company, leveraging external expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.
*   **Trademark Assist (2018):** An interactive tool that educates and assists trademark applicants through the initial stages of the application process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. It uses machine learning to tailor information and help applicants submit high-quality applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. Since its launch, it has served over 41,000 users and increased successful applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Futures Program:** An internal program allowing for experimentation, particularly in AI and machine learning applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.
*   **Internal Quality Assurance System Changes:** Significant changes to internal processes, including compliance and the quality of examination reports, demonstrating "hard yards" [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] that may not be "sexy and IT laced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

### Managing Risk and Collaboration
IP Australia explicitly accepted dedicating a small percentage of its budget to experimentation, especially around early prototyping using agile methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. This approach allowed for fast identification of concerns and was particularly useful in building AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.

The agency also undertook large, risky IT builds, such as the "Rights in One" program for trademarks, which completed in late 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. These projects were risky due to the unique and bespoke nature of their systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. The agency was "maxed out on risk" in late 2018 due to four large projects transforming IT systems and physical workspaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. Agile methodology, an appetite for risk, and strong leadership backing experts helped manage these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

Collaborating with the private sector, such as Aged Digital and Veris Systems, has been crucial, particularly when outcomes are defined by intent and customer experience rather than explicit, nail-down specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Successful partnerships were often built on long-term trust and good personal working relationships, with staff encouraged to see private sector partners as collaborators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

### Responding to COVID-19
IP Australia's prior investments in activity-based working spaces, flexible workplace arrangements, and a strong trust relationship with staff proved invaluable during the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. They had equipped all staff with laptops, good Wi-Fi, and audio-visual equipment, and managers were encouraged to embrace remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. This preparation allowed them to scale from 100 people working remotely to 1,000 people in one week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

The experience highlighted the value of confidence in their ability to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. Australia's National Pandemic Plan, developed after the H1N1 outbreak and regularly updated, also guided their response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. The crisis underscored the importance of scenario planning and strategic risk management, making agencies less dismissive of preparing for unpredictable future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.

## [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation]]

### Communicating Complex Ideas
A significant challenge is communicating complex, technical [[Public Sector Innovation | innovative ideas]] to non-technical staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>. Effective internal communication is critical for cultural shifts towards [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]], ensuring staff understand strategic direction, objectives, mission, and risk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. Technical staff must be able to communicate on multiple levels, simplifying core strategic pieces and providing layered examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

### Types of Innovation
The OPSI distinguishes between different types of [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]]: enhancement-oriented, mission-oriented, anticipatory, and adaptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. While IP Australia initially experienced significant transformative change, there was a need to calibrate to avoid "change exhaustion" among staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Using models like the "innovation passage model" helped the leadership team understand where they were and how to sustain the pace of change without breaking the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>.

*   **Radical/Transformative Innovation:** IP Australia's shift to 100% digital operations, use of AI in patent examination, and comprehensive activity-based working schemes were considered radical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
*   **Adaptive/Enhancement Innovation:** These involve optimizing existing processes and can be "hard yards" that require years to implement but are crucial for sustained improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.

It is suggested that starting with adaptive or enhancement-oriented [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] can build comfort and confidence, making it easier to transition to more transformative efforts later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

### Navigating Lack of Leadership Commitment
When leadership is not fully committed to an [[innovative approaches in public sector leadership | innovative approach]], individuals can still foster [[Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] within their work by:
*   **Focusing on improvements:** Identifying ways to improve processes or take quantum leaps in outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>.
*   **Engaging customers/stakeholders:** Demonstrating external demand or success stories from elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.
*   **Utilizing frameworks:** Using [[innovation_models_and_methods_in_the_public_sector | innovation models]] like the OPSI's to frame proposals as adaptive or enhancement-oriented change, which may be less daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.
*   **Building a track record:** Success in smaller, adaptive innovations can pave the way for more transformative projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.

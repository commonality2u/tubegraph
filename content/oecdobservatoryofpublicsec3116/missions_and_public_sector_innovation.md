The conference "Government beyond recovery panel anticipation to bold missions" was co-organized by the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the OECD's Observatory [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI), with support from the European Institute of Public Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The event focused on new missions emerging from the COVID-19 crisis, aiming to prevent future global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Core Concepts of Missions

Missions are defined as broad, objective statements set with a timeline, providing directionality and intentionality about a desired future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. These objectives are typically long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

Key challenges in implementing missions include:
*   Making them a long-term issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Thinking about alternative futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Committing to new challenges in agile and iterative ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   Avoiding "lock-in" given an uncertain future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Public Sector Innovation Initiatives

The OECD's Observatory [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) is actively working on both anticipatory approaches and [[mission_oriented_innovation_in_public_sector | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The OECD has launched a Missions Action Lab to focus on implementing missions correctly, emphasizing iterative and agile methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

New briefs launched by OPSI include:
*   Anticipatory [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] function in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   [[mission_oriented_innovation_in_public_sector | Mission-oriented innovation]] in government, based on systemic reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

A major report for public consultation on different [[types_of_public_sector_innovation | types of innovation]] and portfolio approaches is expected later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## European Commission Missions

The European Commission's DG Research and [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | Innovation]] launched five missions at the end of September, backed by significant funding from the Horizon Europe program, potentially billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The approach aims to integrate missions across the EU's policy agenda through a robust governance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

The five missions are:
1.  **Conquering Cancer**: Target: More than 3 million lives saved, living longer and better by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
2.  **Climate Resilient Europe**: Target: Prepare Europe for climate disruptions and accelerate transition to a healthy and prosperous future by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
3.  **Mission Starfish (Oceans and Waters)**: Target: Clean marine and fresh waters, restore degraded ecosystems and habitats by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
4.  **100 Climate Neutral Cities**: Target: Support, promote, and showcase 100 cities' systemic transformation towards climate neutrality by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
5.  **Caring for Soil (Life)**: Target: At least 75% of EU soils healthy for food, people, nature, and climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The development of these missions involved:
*   Foresight and a ground-up evidence gathering process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   Expertise from "mission boards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   A novel approach of listening to citizens' inputs through dedicated participative and dialogue techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   Emphasizing strong agreement across policy areas, connection with citizens, decision points for steering, and an analytical framework for monitoring performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
*   The missions are designed to go beyond the Horizon Europe framework program, seeking investments from other sources for continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

## Danish Approach to Green Missions

Denmark, a "post-pandemic country," is focusing on missions and [[mission_oriented_innovation_in_public_sector | mission-driven innovation]], particularly in the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The Innovation Fund Denmark, a publicly funded organization, invests in entrepreneurs, researchers, and businesses to create value and co-fund solutions to societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Denmark's green research strategy (September 2020) highlights four specific green research and [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] missions, which are already in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>:
1.  Capture and storage or use of CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
2.  Green fuels for transport and industry (e.g., Power2X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
3.  Climate- and environment-friendly agriculture and food production, including new food types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
4.  Circular economy with a focus on plastics and textiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

Goals of these partnerships:
*   Contribute to 70% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   Increase biodiversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   Enhance the competitiveness of Danish industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Denmark's approach emphasizes:
*   Connecting all relevant sectors and partners (private, public, financial) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   Developing roadmaps co-created by the ecosystem around each mission, allowing various institutions to identify their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.
*   Aligning on what targets mean and closing the gap between policy and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.
*   Flexible financing and governance models that allow for a "learning mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   The need for pace and courage, building the "road while driving on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.
*   Including partners with different perspectives to challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   Emphasizing international collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.
*   Integrating social science and humanities alongside technological development, as consumer and public adoption are crucial for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   Establishing reoccurring meetings with senior government officials to identify and address political barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

## Norwegian Digitalization Agency's Approach

Norway's digital strategy for the public sector prioritizes "seamless services" for citizens, businesses, and the voluntary sector, focusing on seven "life events" where navigation is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. These life events represent wicked problems requiring systemic changes across sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

The seven prioritized life events are:
*   New in Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   Losing and finding a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   Having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   Death and inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
*   Starting and running a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.
*   Seriously ill children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   Starting and running a voluntary organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

A mission approach is explored for "seriously ill children" and "starting/running a voluntary organization" to address cross-sectoral challenges through collective and targeted efforts from public, private, and voluntary sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This approach combines ambitious top-down goals with broad bottom-up efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

To future-proof seamless services and meet future user needs, Norway utilizes strategic foresight:
*   Analyzing driving forces for change and their potential impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.
*   Using scenario planning (e.g., for white paper on [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]]) to reframe future contexts, expose strategic blind zones, and develop future personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   Aims for new innovative ideas, long-term value, better collaboration, and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Role of Strategic Foresight and Citizen Engagement

Strategic foresight helps drive transformation by:
*   Considering alternative scenarios due to uncertainties (geopolitics, post-carbon economy, technology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
*   Engaging with diverse stakeholders, including excluded families, to understand lived experiences and shape future systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   Identifying desired futures while remaining aware of risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   Integrating insights into program management, early warning systems, and identifying research gaps participatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
*   Engaging with new and emerging actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

Despite being future-oriented by [[definition_of_public_sector_innovation | definition]], many [[mission_oriented_innovation_in_public_sector | mission-oriented innovation]] policies lack formal foresight practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>. The process of missions is more about co-creating the desired future by bringing together actors like policymakers, industry, and researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. This involves a balance between ambition and realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.

Citizen engagement is critical for buy-in and ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. Japan, for example, has created public dialogues to include perspectives of people born and not yet born (e.g., for 2060) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>. The European Commission also engaged with the European Youth Parliament, aiming to support youth involvement in community-based projects through the European Solidarity Corps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Commitment of Senior Leaders
Senior leaders face challenges committing to long-term ambitious goals, especially when their political terms might be shorter than the mission's timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. To encourage commitment, it's important to demonstrate:
*   Strong cross-policy agreement and robustness of the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.
*   Citizen buy-in and ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.
*   Clear decision points and an analytical framework for monitoring performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>.
*   Potential for investments beyond initial funding sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.

### Agility and Iteration
Maintaining flexibility and agility within government structures (e.g., one-year budgets, reporting structures) is crucial for dynamic mission development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.
*   **Governance Models**: Develop governance models that allow for regular evaluation, international progress assessment, and the ability to stop or finance new initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.
*   **Learning Mindset**: Foster a learning mindset within partnerships, acknowledging that initial plans may change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.
*   **Stress Testing**: Periodically stress-test missions by analyzing driving forces, looking at blind zones, and using future personas to keep the future in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.
*   **Nested Structures**: The core mission statement might remain stable, but lower-level objectives require significant adaptation based on monitoring and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

### Avoiding "Mission Washing"
A significant danger is "mission washing," where existing activities are merely reframed as missions without changing delivery methods or encouraging new inventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. True missions require doing things differently to achieve broad, future-oriented goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.

### Intergenerational Justice and Well-being
There is an increasing emphasis on intergenerational fairness, especially regarding climate change. Missions should integrate well-being and behavioral dimensions from the start, rather than solely relying on technological solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. This requires engaging with parliament, seeking bipartisan political leadership, and involving bodies like supreme audit institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>. Institutions need to be built for the long term, linking financial ministries, recruitment, and performance rewards to long-term thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.

### Handling Failure
The term "failure" is complex; often, processes lead to outcomes that don't fully succeed but still yield valuable insights or side effects (e.g., the Internet from Cold War missions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.
*   **Reflectivity**: Robust evaluation systems are crucial to learn from outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>.
*   **Exit Strategies**: Missions should have planned exit strategies to avoid abrupt, brutal discontinuation, allowing activities to be repurposed or reformed for future iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>.

## Personal Commitments for Recovery

Panelists shared their personal commitments for working differently towards recovery:
*   **Kirsten Carlson Haugs**: Committed to staying open for change, carrying forward new ways of working and collaborating experienced during the pandemic, and making conscious choices about which learnings to keep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:02]</a>.
*   **Annmarie Rasmussen**: Committed to courage and pace in doing things differently, acknowledging there's no blueprint, and fostering a "test and learn" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.
*   **Neville Reeve**: Committed to recognizing the power of sharing information to build trust and extend ownership, drawing lessons from the European experience with vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:39">[01:25:39]</a>.
*   **Cat Tully**: Committed to continually asking if decisions and investments are "intergenerationally fair" and working to foster intergenerational solidarity rather than conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:22">[01:26:22]</a>.
*   **Philippe Larédo**: Committed to continued action research and practice-based research within the Missions Action Lab, learning from missions while simultaneously providing advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:05">[01:27:05]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly exacerbated the global crisis of gender-based violence (GBV), often referred to as a "shadow pandemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. Even before the pandemic, it was estimated that over one-third of women experienced some form of violence at least once in their lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. The OECD considers GBV a profound priority area within its agenda on gender equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Exacerbation of the Crisis During the Pandemic

The pandemic increased pressure on governments and intensified stress within families due to factors like job loss, financial insecurity, and confinement during lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. Victims, primarily women and girls, were often confined with their abusers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Reports from OECD and partner countries showed a significant increase in GBV rates, similar to past health crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

In Chile, there was a 250% increase in calls to GBV hotlines during lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>. Beyond increased numbers, the severity of incidents also rose, with hospitals seeing an increase in severe injuries among women and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>.

## Challenges for Governments

Governments faced several challenges in addressing GBV during the pandemic:
*   **Difficulty in monitoring**: During lockdowns, it became nearly impossible to know precisely what was happening inside homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.
*   **Victim's reluctance to seek help**: Victims feared perpetrators, worried about bringing greater difficulties to their families, believed services were closed or not prioritized, or were afraid of getting sick at counseling centers or shelters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Initial Attention**: In many countries, the initial focus of pandemic responses was on lockdowns and economic consequences, with little attention to domestic violence or child abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:04]</a>.
*   **Data Scarcity**: Reliable and sound data on GBV cases proved difficult to collect quickly during the crisis, making it hard to identify where to target efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:35:00">[53:35:00]</a>.
*   **Insufficient Commitment**: A major barrier identified in government responses was insufficient commitment and prioritization of GBV issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:44:00">[53:44:00]</a>.
*   **Resource Limitations**: Lack of resources and capacity for service providers was another significant barrier to effective response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:12:00">[54:12:00]</a>.

## Government Responses and [[innovations_in_supporting_survivors_of_violence_during_the_pandemic | Innovations]]

The pandemic highlighted the need for governments to plan more strategically and act proactively on GBV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Many governments took action, leading to important [[innovations_in_supporting_survivors_of_violence_during_the_pandemic | innovations]] and lessons learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>.

### Key Approaches:

*   **Whole-of-Government and Whole-of-Society Approaches**: Addressing GBV requires a multi-agency, [[wholeofgovernment_approaches_to_addressing_genderbased_violence | whole-of-government approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>, involving health providers, police forces, justice, and social help centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>. It also necessitates a whole-of-society approach, engaging civil society, media, and even the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:42:00">[50:42:00]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Continuity of Services**: A primary goal was to ensure counseling centers, shelters, and police services remained fully functional and available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:30:00">[46:30:00]</a>. Services related to GBV were declared essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:41:00">[47:41:00]</a>.
*   **Public Awareness and Communication**: The [[role_of_media_and_public_awareness_in_tackling_genderbased_violence | role of media]] was crucial in informing the public that domestic violence remained a priority for governments and that help was available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. Campaigns emphasized zero tolerance for domestic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:42:00">[41:42:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptation and Flexibility**: Services had to adapt through creative solutions, such as shifting to online consultations and creating alternative housing options like hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:07:00">[36:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>.
*   **Survivor-Centric Approaches**: Placing the survivor at the center of the response is paramount, requiring active listening to their experiences and needs to inform service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:02:24">[1:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:17:07">[1:17:07]</a>.

### Country-Specific Examples:

#### Switzerland
*   **National Task Force**: A national task force on violence and COVID-19 was established in March 2020 following the semi-lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>. Chaired by the Federal Office for Gender Equality, its goals included ensuring counseling centers and shelters continued functioning and police remained available to enforce restraining orders and remove violent persons from homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>.
*   **Coordination**: The task force improved [[coordinating_multiagency_responses_to_genderbased_violence | coordination]] between different services (police, shelters, counseling centers) and across government levels (national and local) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[25:56:00]</a>. It met weekly, a significant increase from the previous committee's two-three times a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>.
*   **Public Campaigns**: A poster campaign was launched quickly with the help of professional organizations (groceries, pharmacies, garden centers) to inform the population that domestic violence was not tolerated and help was available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:00">[28:36:00]</a>. This campaign used 13 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:51">[1:12:51]</a>.
*   **Financial Support**: Increased financial support was provided to helplines due to increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>.
*   **Data Challenges**: While phone calls to centers increased, police-reported domestic violence cases did not generally increase, leading to caution in drawing conclusions due to the semi-confinement model and enhanced information campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>. There is a need for better data and evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:42">[1:13:42]</a>.

#### Chile
*   **Contingency Plan**: Chile adopted a contingency plan in March, leveraging lessons from other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:11:00">[46:11:00]</a>.
*   **Service Continuity**: Ensured 109 GBV day centers and 45 shelters operated at full capacity, increasing resources and hotline shifts to meet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:45:00">[46:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:04:00">[47:04:00]</a>.
*   **Legal Protections**: Restraining orders and other protection measures were automatically extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:44:00">[47:44:00]</a>. It was publicly communicated that women violating curfew for GBV help would not face sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:52:00">[47:52:00]</a>.
*   **New Communication Channels**: Developed silent helplines including a WhatsApp line, an online website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:21:00">[48:21:00]</a>, and plans for SMS to reach non-smartphone users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:08:00">[49:08:00]</a>. An alliance with pharmacies for information dissemination was implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>.
*   **Public Health Messaging**: Helpline information was included in daily national TV COVID-19 sanitary reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:38:00">[49:38:00]</a>. Media campaigns, such as "No Place for Violence in This Community" and "Do It for Her," promoted GBV prevention as a societal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:05:00">[50:05:00]</a>.
*   **Multi-Sectoral Engagement**: Created a Council of Women on COVID-19 with congresswomen and civil society to address the pandemic's differentiated impact on women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:52:00">[50:52:00]</a>. Partnered with Banco Estado (Chilean state bank) to make GBV information available in local banking shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:28:00">[51:28:00]</a>, and with the private sector to promote prevention and detection among employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:57:00">[51:57:00]</a>.
*   **Future Initiatives**: A project with the World Bank aims to identify bottlenecks and gaps in the GBV response system to improve [[coordinating_multiagency_responses_to_genderbased_violence | coordination]] and access to justice, hoping to develop a single registry for survivor information to avoid secondary victimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:08">[1:08:08]</a>. Collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank will leverage behavioral science to train first responders (police, prosecutors, judiciary) to challenge biases and improve service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:46">[1:08:46]</a>. A platform for online courses on positive masculinity will engage men and boys in prevention efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:27">[1:09:27]</a>, and a public awareness platform called "Chile Alerta" will be launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:54">[1:09:54]</a>.

#### Family Justice Center Model
*   **Multi-disciplinary Approach**: This model brings professionals from different organizations (police, justice, social services) to work together under one roof to support GBV survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:24:00">[34:24:00]</a>. Originating in the U.S. in 2002, it has proven highly effective and is credited with saving lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:46:00">[34:46:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid Adaptation**: In Antwerp, a Family Justice Center quickly transformed its operations into a central and virtual coordination role during COVID-19, thanks to existing interdisciplinary cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:18:00">[35:18:00]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: A survey in Belgium showed an increase in reported cases in areas with Family Justice Centers during the pandemic, contrasting with a decrease in areas without them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>.
*   **Global Learning**: The European Family Justice Center Alliance engaged in weekly experience sharing with centers in the U.S. to learn from common struggles and develop practical guidelines for professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>.
*   **Creative Solutions**: Examples include securing additional housing places in hotels for survivors and developing "sidewalk conversations" or special meeting points for professionals to connect with survivors outside homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:29:00">[40:29:00]</a>.
*   **Policy Recommendations**: Governments should make a clear choice to implement proven effective models, listen to survivors' experiences, and signal publicly that domestic violence is never accepted and services are always open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:01:10">[1:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:10">[1:03:10]</a>. Exceptions for victims seeking help during curfews should be made public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:03:00">[43:03:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Future Directions

The pandemic demonstrated the need for greater government planning and proactive action on GBV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Key lessons and future priorities include:
*   **Prioritizing GBV**: Governments must recognize GBV as a critical issue, not to be sidelined during other crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>.
*   **Robust Coordination Mechanisms**: Establishing and strengthening permanent [[coordinating_multiagency_responses_to_genderbased_violence | coordination]] mechanisms and networks in "normal" times allows for rapid scaling up during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:10:00">[56:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:32">[1:12:32]</a>.
*   **Survivor-Centric Design**: Services must be designed with the needs of survivors at the center, ensuring accessibility (e.g., multi-language support, diverse communication channels like WhatsApp/SMS) and avoiding re-victimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:02:24">[1:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:15:05">[1:15:05]</a>. This includes accounting for intersectional identities (age, disability, migration status) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:11">[1:11:11]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Policy**: Improved data collection and analysis are crucial for evidence-based policy responses, identifying vulnerable groups, and evaluating the effectiveness of measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:00">[1:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:42">[1:13:42]</a>.
*   **Innovation and Flexibility**: Fostering a culture of [[impact_of_covid19_on_global_innovation | innovation]] and adaptability in service delivery, exploring new tools and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:18:06">[1:18:06]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning**: Encouraging mutual learning and exchange of effective practices among countries, rather than reinventing the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:19:38">[1:19:38]</a>.

The OECD's technical advisory group on GBV is finalizing a framework for countries to strengthen governance and adopt survivor-centric approaches, based on three pillars: a systems approach with intersectional coordination and holistic legislation; fostering cultural change for survivor-centric responses and access to justice; and improving accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>. This framework aims to provide a roadmap for better preparedness for future crises.

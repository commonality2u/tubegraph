Governments need to [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovate]] and adapt their systems for several key reasons, ranging from improving current service delivery to preparing for future societal and environmental shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Reasons for Government Innovation

### 1. Delivering Better Value
Governments have not yet solved all the problems faced by their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. To be more impactful, governments must [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovate]] and change their approaches to deliver new or better value for their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This means finding more impactful solutions to existing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:17">[02:00:17]</a>.

### 2. Adapting to a Changing World
The world around governments is constantly changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Many [[challenges_of_outdated_government_systems | government systems]], such as healthcare, welfare, and taxation, were designed in the 1950s and no longer match today's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Key changes include:
*   **Digitalization** The shift to online services means citizens expect the same ease of experience when interacting with government as they do with other online services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This requires governments to [[role_of_technology_in_government_modernization | adapt to new systems]] emerging from [[role_of_technology_in_government_modernization | technology]] and digital use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.
*   **Changing Societal Needs** People's needs and how they live their lives have changed significantly since the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. Governments must respond to these evolving needs of changing societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

Governments must [[building_resilient_and_adaptive_government_systems | adapt]] and change with the developments occurring around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>.

### 3. Anticipating Future Challenges
Governments must also look forward and [[preparing_for_future_challenges_through_government_innovation | prepare for fundamental changes]] and complex challenges ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>. This includes addressing issues like climate change, aging populations, and the emergence of new types of societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>.

To be ready for tomorrow, [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | innovation]] and different ways of thinking are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:09">[02:00:09]</a>. This proactive approach helps governments [[anticipatory_innovation_for_governments | anticipate the future]] and fundamental changes that will impact how government functions and how people live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:38">[02:00:38]</a>.

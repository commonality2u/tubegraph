Enhancing [[public_sector_digital_transformation_strategies | public sector integrity]] and preventing corruption are critical objectives for governments worldwide. Recent initiatives, particularly within the OECD, emphasize a shift towards more strategic and context-dependent approaches, leveraging [[Behavioral insights in public integrity | behavioral insights]] to foster a culture of integrity and ensure effective implementation of policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

## Project Context in Slovakia

An extensive four-year project with Slovak institutions, including the anti-corruption prevention department and the government office, focused on improving capacities within the Slovak public administration to reinforce integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This initiative involved analytical work and direct engagement with civil servants to develop concrete tools and implement integrity measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

Key project areas included:
*   Incorporating a strategic approach to inform integrity policies, specifically within the framework of the former National anti-corruption policy of the Slovak Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   Improving horizontal coordination across integrity functions to implement strategic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   Engaging the whole of society in integrity efforts to ensure fit-for-purpose integrity reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   Applying a [[Behavioral insights in public integrity | behavioral risk-based approach]] to corruption prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This approach is crucial for identifying pressing risks, mitigating them effectively, and strengthening the accountability of civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

The "Integrity Review of the Slovak Republic," published in 2022, provided a 360-degree view of the Slovak integrity system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. It highlighted that while measures were in place to strengthen corruption risk management, their application was lagging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. This challenge is not unique to Slovakia, as many OECD countries struggle with consistently applying corruption risk management frameworks in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

## The Role of Behavioral Insights

The OECD Recommendation on Public Integrity, launched in 2017, advocates for applying [[Behavioral insights in public integrity | behavioral insights]] in policymaking to shift from ad-hoc integrity policies to a more strategic, context-dependent, and behavior-risk-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. This recommendation emphasizes cultivating a culture of integrity across all societal actors, including public servants, businesses, civil society organizations, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

[[Behavioral insights in public integrity | Behavioral insights]] are important for anti-corruption and integrity measures in two main ways:
1.  **Supporting Ethical Choices**: Most individuals possess a "moral compass" that guides their actions, even when unobserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. While people generally strive to act with integrity, they may rationalize non-ethical actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. Traditional anti-corruption measures often focus on punishing corrupt individuals, which can be costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. A behavioral approach, however, seeks to empower public officials who wish to act correctly and create an environment that supports ethical choices, fostering an "open culture of integrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.
2.  **Ensuring Effective Implementation of Integrity Policies**: [[Behavioral insights in public integrity | Behavioral insights]] consider the real behaviors of public officials during policy implementation, which can prevent policies from backfiring or failing to achieve desired impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. This applies to various integrity policies, including corruption risk management, internal and external audits, conflict of interest management, and communication on integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

## The Slovak Experiment: A Behavioral Approach

The project in Slovakia included an experiment based on the OECD's BASIC framework (Behavior, Analysis, Strategy, Intervention, Change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. The central question was how to prevent corruption in the Slovak public administration, specifically empowering public sector employees to detect and report corruption risks and feel safe doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

### Identifying Behavioral Barriers

Through focus groups and interviews with anti-corruption coordinators and public officials, several behaviors hindering integrity were identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>:
*   **"Ticking the Box" by Managers**: Managers formally complied with procedures but didn't act in line with the code of conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
*   **Misreporting**: Managers misreported progress to meet obligations, particularly for the National Recovery and Resilience Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>.
*   **Underutilized Electronic Survey**: An existing electronic survey for reporting risks was not encouraged by managers, and employees underused it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.
*   **Culture of Silence**: Employees were generally reluctant to speak up about corruption risks due to a "culture of fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>. This was particularly true for *potential* risks, not just incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.

The experiment focused on addressing the reluctance to speak up about potential corruption risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>. Drivers for this included a lack of leadership by example, limited understanding of reporting channels, and psychological costs (e.g., fear of retaliation, lack of anonymity, no feedback loop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.

### Experiment Design and Interventions

A randomized vignette experiment was conducted with 2,537 public officials from line ministries and central authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:33:00">[30:33:00]</a>. Participants were presented with a hypothetical situation involving a potential corruption risk (e.g., suspicions of conflicts of interest in hiring procedures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a>.

Two interventions targeted the identified barriers:
1.  **Understanding of Risk (Analogy Message)**: This message used an analogy from health (speaking to a doctor about risk factors like smoking) to explain the importance of reporting potential corruption risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Exemplary Leadership**: This message described a manager who actively raised hiring risks and encouraged colleagues to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:50:00">[28:50:00]</a>.

Both messages concluded with an injunctive social norm, reminding participants that "every civil servant should be honest and speak about corruption risks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>. A lottery with a chance to chat with the Prime Minister was offered to encourage participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a>.

### Key Findings

*   **Baseline Reporting**: In the control group (no intervention), 48% of respondents were likely to communicate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:00">[31:53:00]</a>.
*   **Impact of Interventions**:
    *   The **Exemplary Leadership** message was the most impactful, increasing the likelihood of communicating a risk by approximately 14 percentage points compared to the control group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29:00">[33:29:00]</a>.
    *   The **Understanding of Risks** message increased the likelihood by approximately 9 percentage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[33:42:00]</a>.
*   **Age Effect**: Younger respondents were significantly more likely to communicate a corruption risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>. An increase in age by one year decreased the likelihood by 0.23 percentage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:00">[34:27:00]</a>. This could be due to a greater fear of retaliation among senior staff and a "status quo bias" from longer careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>, or different beliefs about the utility of reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>.
*   **Feeling of Safety**: People generally felt safer communicating a risk after being asked whom they would report to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:23:00">[35:23:00]</a>. The interventions slightly increased this feeling (around 3 percentage points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>. Most preferred to communicate risks to their managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>. Older respondents were less likely to feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:21:00">[36:21:00]</a>.
*   **Trust in System**: Trust in the risk management system correlated positively with feeling safe and likelihood to communicate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:01:00">[37:01:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding of Risk (Measured Outcome)**: Only 30.8% of respondents correctly identified the vignette situation as a "corruption risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>. Neither treatment significantly improved this understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:02:00">[38:02:00]</a>.

## Recommendations and Outlook

The findings provide concrete lines of action for Slovakia's new National Anti-Corruption Strategy (2024-2029) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>:

*   **Empower Leaders**: Since leadership messaging was most effective, it is crucial to empower leaders to set standards through their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:28:00">[39:28:00]</a>. This can be achieved by providing training that equips them with the knowledge and skills to lead by example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35:00">[39:35:00]</a>. [[innovative approaches in public sector leadership | Anti-corruption coordinators]] also play a key role in setting examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:52:00">[39:52:00]</a>.
*   **Simplify Communication Processes**: Make the risk communication process easy and well-understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:18:00">[40:18:00]</a>. Policies should align with employee preferences, such as reporting to managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a>. Raising awareness of existing reporting channels (like electronic surveys) and implementing clear, concise, and behaviorally informed guidelines are vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:02:00">[41:02:00]</a>.
*   **Cultivate a Culture of Safety**: Feelings of safety are a key enabler for people to speak up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>. Fostering a culture where speaking up is a social norm is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>.

This study exemplifies [[innovative approaches in public sector organizations | innovative approaches in public sector organizations]] and contributes to [[strategies for fostering government innovation | strategies for fostering government innovation]] by rigorously testing interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:34:00">[47:34:00]</a>. The use of vignettes allowed for testing the impact of interventions on a sensitive topic like corruption, minimizing social desirability bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:51:00">[47:51:00]</a>. The substantial magnitude of the effects, even with small changes in wording, highlights the power of [[Behavioral insights in public integrity | behavioral interventions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:16:00">[48:16:00]</a>.

Future work includes scaling up these interventions in real-world settings, such as comparing different reporting channels or training programs across various public administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:19:00">[56:19:00]</a>. Simplifying methodological guidance around corruption risk management will also contribute to better practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:30:00">[58:30:00]</a>. The findings are also relevant for [[building_trust_in_public_institutions | building trust in public institutions]] and fostering a culture of integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

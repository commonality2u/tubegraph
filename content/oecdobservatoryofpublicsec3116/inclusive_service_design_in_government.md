Inclusive service design in government focuses on ensuring that public services meet the expectations of all users, especially in the digital age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This approach recognizes that while digital opportunities are vast, services must respond to the needs of people who expect inclusivity and trustworthiness from their public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Core Challenges in Digital Public Services

During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments faced pressure to become "digital by default" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, a key question for governments is how to leverage digital opportunities while ensuring services meet the expectations of final users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Challenges identified in the implementation of "digital by default" concepts include:
*   **Skills and Capabilities of Citizens**: A significant portion of the population may not be comfortable or able to use digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, leading to a risk of exclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:43">[01:27:43]</a>.
*   **Silos and Lack of Collaboration within Government**: Different government departments often operate services in isolated silos, hindering seamless user journeys and integrated problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Closing In-Person Access**: A "digital by default" mindset can limit thinking by separating e-services from traditional services, leading to disconnected experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Access to the Internet**: Some citizens lack internet access in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Accessibility Needs**: Ensuring services are accessible to people with disabilities is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.
*   **Difficulties in Data Access**: Obtaining and using data across government can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The OECD's [[Digital transformation and inclusion in government services | digital government policy framework]] aims to help governments overcome these challenges, emphasizing that access must provide the same opportunities to all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Country Approaches to Inclusive Service Design

### Slovenia
Slovenia emphasizes an **omnichannel** approach, acknowledging the need for digital channels while not forgetting those who cannot or do not want to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Balancing Digital and Physical**: Traditionally, Slovenia has strong physical administrative services, which citizens often prefer due to the counseling received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. During the pandemic, when physical units were inaccessible, digital portal use surged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Digital Identity**: A new electronic identity card is planned for early next year to provide citizens with an effective ticket to the digital world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Data Use**: Slovenia prioritizes the use of data from government registers, pre-filling application forms using central population register data, and efficient data exchange in the background to reduce citizen interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. This aligns with the "once-only" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Trust**: Legal compliance (like GDPR) and ethical considerations are paramount for data exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. External institutions, such as the Information Commissioner, are crucial for demonstrating transparency and building public trust in data use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.
*   [[Digital transformation and inclusion in government services | Digital Transformation]] Strategy: The emerging [[Innovation in the public sector | Digital Public Services Strategy]] will focus on modern service design, user engagement, co-creation, and unifying user experience across channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### United Kingdom
The UK's approach to [[Innovation in public services | innovation in public services]] and digital service design has evolved systematically over about ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
*   [[Role of adaptive innovation in government services | Agile Ways of Working]] and Digital Skills: Investing in digital skills for public servants allows government to build in-house capabilities and react quickly to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Multi-Channel Support**: Good services support multiple channels and allow users to switch between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. For instance, the 'Notify' platform can send both digital and physical (letters, texts) notifications, ensuring vulnerable users are reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Common Components and Design Patterns**: Having a toolkit of tested building blocks (e.g., for notifications, identity checks) and documented design patterns accelerates service development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Cross-Government Collaboration**: Services should not stop at departmental boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. A single domain like gov.uk can simplify government by encouraging departments to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **User Research Standards**: Services must conduct research with a broad range of users, including those who are less digitally literate, to inform design for all channels (digital, call center, paper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>.
*   **Digital Identity Challenges**: While digital identity exists, making it inclusive remains a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Concerns about data linking between departments and consent need careful management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.

### France
France focuses on a "digital by design" approach, but not "digital by default," acknowledging that a large part of the population is not comfortable with digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>.
*   **Physical Access Points**: France multiplies physical places, especially in less urban areas, to welcome and assist citizens with digital services or improve their digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a>.
*   **User Research and Simplification**: Services should be usable, useful, and designed with citizens in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. Extensive research and talking to diverse user groups (e.g., farmers) are crucial for simplifying services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Accessible Communication**: Communication about services needs to be accessible and understandable by everyone, including those with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. This includes using simplified language (like "FALC" – *francais facile à lire et à comprendre*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>.
*   **Design System and Homogenization**: Building a design system helps standardize and homogenize services, making them more comfortable and familiar for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.
*   **Proactive Data Use**: Utilizing data and APIs can enable proactive service delivery, such as offering social aid to a person known to need it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   **Quality Monitoring**: The "Observatory of Digital Public Services" monitors the quality of 250 high-volume digital services every three months against criteria like mobile accessibility, disability accessibility, and API use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. User satisfaction is a key indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.
*   **UX Commandos**: Teams of experts (designers, developers, user researchers) are deployed to existing services to improve specific key performance indicators (KPIs) like accessibility or satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. This fosters better working methods and long-term improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.

### Portugal
Portugal strongly advocates for a [[Usercentric and omnichannel approaches to public service delivery | user-centric and omnichannel approach]] to public service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.
*   **Omnichannel Delivery**: While digital access is privileged, accessibility through alternative channels like telephone or face-to-face interactions is ensured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. The goal is for citizens to initiate contact in one channel and complete it in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.
*   **Service Networks**: A nationwide network of "cities and shops" and "citizen spaces" offers one-stop access to services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. These spaces include trained mediators who assist citizens with using digital services, improving digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. Mobile citizen spaces (vans) extend this reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **User Needs and Clear Language**: Designing services with a focus on user needs and using clear, understandable language is crucial, as citizens may not understand public organization structures or technical jargon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.
*   **Technological Building Blocks**: Portugal leverages existing tools like a public service design toolkit, digital identity solutions (including mobile authentication), an interoperability platform, and a single digital gateway (the national portal for public services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Networks**: Important networks, such as the Council for Information and Communication Technology and the Interministerial Network for Modernization, foster coordination and quick responses across government areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
*   **Transparency of Data Use**: Citizens can see what data a specific service will access and for what purpose when authenticating via their digital identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.
*   **Digital Literacy Programs**: National programs like "Encode" aim to improve digital literacy for citizens and companies through surveys, training actions, and measures for public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>.

## Key Enablers for Inclusive Service Design

*   **Digital Skills and Mindset**: Public servants need skills and an understanding of [[Role of adaptive innovation in government services | agile ways of working]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This digital mindset is a mix of skills, agile working, and organizational support from the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **Components and Platforms**: Investing in shared components (like notification platforms, identity checks, form builders) and platforms streamlines service development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **[[Data governance for public sector innovation | Data Governance for Public Sector Innovation]]**: The use of data is crucial for efficient service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. This requires strong legal frameworks (e.g., GDPR), ethical guidelines, transparency, and often an independent oversight body to build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.
*   **[[Inclusive policymaking and community engagement | Inclusive Policymaking and Community Engagement]]**: Governments should actively involve users through co-creation and gather feedback at all stages of the service lifecycle, not just design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
*   **Strategic Approach**: Balancing emergency responses with systematic approaches is key to long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This includes strategic data management covering open, closed, and personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   **Innovation Labs**: These can act as catalysts for change and agility by providing test beds and good examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. However, they need to be anchored to the broader organizational context and have a plan for wider application to avoid being isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.
*   **Reducing Complexity**: While digital systems may have inherent complexity, the goal is to make services simple and convenient for the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. This involves hiding sophisticated backend systems (security, identity, data exchange) from the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>.

## Moving Forward

Looking beyond the immediate crisis, leaders are committed to:
*   Accelerating [[Digital transformation and inclusion in government services | digital government]] by providing common frameworks for design and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.
*   Improving [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data governance]] and leveraging data science for faster understanding and more [[Adaptive innovation in public services | agile responses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:34">[01:24:34]</a>.
*   Prioritizing and pushing for more **inclusivity** in services and their design, especially ensuring that those in positions of power understand the importance of including all citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>.
*   Systematically improving conditions for delivering and using online services through better coordination, co-creation, and continued investment in skills and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>.

Ultimately, being digital does not mean that all users are digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:25">[01:27:25]</a>. The purpose of [[Inclusive policymaking and community engagement | inclusive public services]] in the digital age is to provide a consistent experience for all users across all different channels, managing the risk of exclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>. This journey requires strong leadership, the right skills and mindset within administration, key components like data, and clear communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:47">[01:27:47]</a>.

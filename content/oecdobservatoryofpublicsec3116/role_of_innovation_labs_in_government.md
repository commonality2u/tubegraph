Innovation labs play a crucial role in fostering [[innovation in government | innovation]] within public administration by providing safe spaces for [[experimentation in government innovation | experimentation]] and promoting new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. They address the perceived bureaucratic and hierarchical nature of public sectors, demonstrating that [[innovation in government | innovation]] and traditional structures can coexist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## LabX: Portugal's Center for Innovation in Public Sector

LabX, an experimental project supported by the Portuguese government since 2017, aims to foster [[innovation in government | innovation]] in public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. It was designed as an open and safe space to experiment and promote innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Objectives and Evolution
LabX's initial objectives included:
*   Creating a network of innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   Designing new public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   Engaging citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   Rooting strategic thinking in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   Improving public services through [[experimentation in government innovation | experimentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   Fostering capacity building in public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   Spreading good practices to engage the community and tackle organizational silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   Positively impacting public service delivery through process simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

The lab served as an incubator for designing, testing, and improving innovative projects in public administration, with ideas proposed by public servants, managers, universities, research centers, private companies, and the social sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. By 2021, LabX evolved from an [[experimentation in government innovation | experimentation]] lab to an ambitious center for [[innovation in government | innovation]] in the public sector, driven by a strong focus on [[Innovation Strategies in Government | innovation strategies]] as a whole policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:37">[01:26:37]</a>.

### Achievements and Impact
*   Carried out 25 experimental projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.
*   Engaged over 10,000 citizens and more than 2,000 public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   Involved over 160 public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:41">[01:33:41]</a>.
*   Contributed to "Simplex," Portugal's flagship program for administrative simplification and [[innovation in government | innovation]], by integrating projects that ease the lives of citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:59">[01:41:59]</a>.
*   Developed a network of almost 700 innovators and a growing network of experimental labs in partnership with local governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.
*   Published a guide on human rights-based approach to public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.
*   During the pandemic, more than 200 new projects emerged spontaneously within a couple of weeks to address citizens' needs, showing the ingrained innovation culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:06">[02:05:06]</a>.

### Key Success Factors and Challenges
*   **Changing Mindset:** The biggest challenge is making people realize that [[innovation in government | innovation]] is everyone's business and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>. LabX fosters this by showing that testing, trying, and learning from mistakes are the way forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">[02:22:01]</a>.
*   **Political Sponsorship:** Consistent political commitment and engagement from government members responsible for the project are crucial for its success and sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:28">[02:26:28]</a>.
*   **Incentives:** Portugal implemented a system of incentives for innovation in public management, built on three pillars:
    1.  **Training:** Providing training for civil servants and managers to understand [[innovation in government | innovation]] drivers and barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.
    2.  **Experimentation ("Right to Challenge"):** Allowing teams to request temporary removal of regulatory barriers to test new approaches. This empowers public servants to challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>.
    3.  **Recognition:** Establishing a prize for [[innovation in government | innovation]] in management, valuing people and working environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>.
*   **Strategic Vision:** The Portuguese government developed a strategy for [[innovation in government | innovation]] in public administration, identifying four pillars for a fit-for-purpose public administration: investing in people, developing management models, exploring digital technology, and fostering proximity with partners for diverse [[innovation in government | innovation]] flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

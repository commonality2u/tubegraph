The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) developed the OPSI Toolkit Navigator to address specific [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation_in_the_public_sector | challenges in implementing innovation in the public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This public service project, supported by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 program, aimed to provide a solution to common difficulties faced by [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The "Peak Toolkit" Problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

In 2017, OPSI was tasked with building a toolkit for all [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, the initial thought was that the world did not need "another toolkit," given that hundreds already existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The concern was that another toolkit would simply add "noise" rather than providing "signal" through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

To understand the real needs, OPSI conducted a workshop in 2017 with [[public_sector_innovation | public sector leaders]] and civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The goal was to learn about their journey when trying something new, including how they found information, who they reached out to, and what tools and methods they used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This research revealed many "daily struggles for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovators]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, leading to the development of the Toolkit Navigator not as a new toolkit, but as a guide to help people find the right existing toolkits based on their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

This quote highlights a key challenge: while many toolkits exist, individuals prefer to create their own or adapt them to their specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Identified [[Challenges in Implementing Innovation in the Public Sector | Challenges with Existing Toolkits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>

Through extensive research, including reviewing approximately 500 toolkits and conducting user research with [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovators]], several common [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation_in_the_public_sector | challenges]] were identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>:

*   **Over-reliance on Past Tools** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>: Innovators often default to tools that have worked in the past, even if they are not optimal for the current problem.
*   **Misalignment with Problems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>: Toolkits are frequently used because they are "bright and shiny" or a colleague used them, rather than being aligned with the specific problems being faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Ignoring Existing Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>: Some toolkits require very advanced skills, which may not be present in the user's team.
*   **Granularity Issues** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>: Toolkits can be either too granular (overly specific) or too broad (lacking actionable detail), making it difficult to find something at the right level of abstraction for the user's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Creating Learned Helplessness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>: Especially in the public sector, polished toolkits can be perceived as something difficult to alter, even when the user's situation and context demand adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## The Multifaceted Innovation Model: Addressing Diverse Purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>

A key backdrop to understanding innovation [[challenges_in_public_sector_innovation | challenges]] is OPSI's multifaceted innovation model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This model, derived from system-level studies of governments in Canada and Brazil, outlines different purposes for innovation in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>:

*   **Directed/Shaping (Top-down)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>: Mission-oriented innovation, like putting a person on the moon.
*   **Undirected/Responding (Bottom-up)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>: Innovation for innovation's sake, creating space for entrepreneurial spirit to find new solutions.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented (High Certainty)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>: Improving existing processes and services, such as using behavioral insights to increase tax payments.
*   **Exploring/Radical Shifts (Uncertain Spaces)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>: Examining how internal and external factors will change the nature of work.

Each of these facets requires "very different methods and very different processes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The choice of methods matters significantly, as investing heavily in certain approaches (e.g., lean business process management, quality control) biases outcomes towards specific types of innovation (e.g., enhancement-oriented) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This underscores the challenge of aligning methods with the intended purpose of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges through Navigator Design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>

The OPSI Toolkit Navigator was designed with features to overcome the identified [[challenges_in_public_sector_innovation | challenges]]:

*   **Adaptable and Transferable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>: Toolkits should be usable in different contexts, not just directly transferred.
*   **Approachable and User-Centered** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>: It should be clear what to do with the toolkit.
*   **Action-Oriented** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>: Toolkits are about leading to action, distinct from guidance or knowledge bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Modular** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>: Users should be able to combine parts of different toolkits to suit their specific context and problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **"Jobs to be Done" Organization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>: Toolkits are organized by innovation tasks, including not only typical "problem-solving jobs" (discovery, prototyping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, but also:
    *   **Group Behavioral Jobs**: Building consensus, shared understanding, challenging assumptions, cultivating mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
    *   **Approach Planning Jobs**: Preliminary scoping and getting started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   **Contextualization Jobs**: Understanding the dynamics of the working environment, visualizing systems, imagining futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    This broader categorization addresses the challenge that the work of a [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovator]] extends beyond just problem-solving to include coordination, partnerships, and creating good experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Distinguishing Levels of Granularity**: The navigator helps users understand the difference between abstract methodologies (e.g., design methodology) and specific techniques (e.g., using paper-based forms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, ensuring they find tools at the right level of abstraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Social Proof**: Recognizing that trying new methods is "scary," the navigator connects toolkits to case studies where others have successfully applied them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. It also connects to a user base of over 1700 [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovators]] globally for discussions, reviews, and seeking advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Adaptability and Remixing**: The navigator prioritizes freely accessible toolkits, especially those licensed for reuse, adaptation, and remixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This is because the act of remixing and adapting builds capacity within teams, often the "limiting ingredient for innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Toolkits are awarded badges (Open Source Basic, Open Source Champion, Hero) to indicate their adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

The OPSI Toolkit Navigator is a constantly developing resource, welcoming feedback and new toolkit submissions to further address the evolving landscape of [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

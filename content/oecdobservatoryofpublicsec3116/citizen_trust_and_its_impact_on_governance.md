The topic of [[citizen_trust_and_public_communication | citizen trust]] in government and its impact on the sustainability of transformations is a central theme in discussions about public sector innovation, particularly in the wake of global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The ability to drive change and implement solutions is significantly affected by the level of trust citizens place in their government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Importance of Citizen Trust
For sustained changes in governance to endure, it is crucial that citizens trust the government and the expanded role it has assumed during times of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This external factor is vital in driving performance and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.

## Impact of Crises on Trust
Historically, major shocks have had varying impacts on [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust in institutions]]:
*   **The Great Financial Crisis**: During the great financial crisis, [[building_trust_in_public_institutions | trust in government]] significantly declined across most developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This was partly due to public perception that governments failed to regulate banks properly and then burdened ordinary citizens with the costs of bailouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. This experience damaged public confidence in institutions and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>.
*   **The Pandemic**: The response to the pandemic is viewed differently, as the crisis itself was not caused by government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. While people may be unhappy about measures like lockdowns, there's often a general confidence that the government's response has been effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. How citizens ultimately perceive government performance post-crisis will significantly impact their [[trust_and_power_in_citizengovernment_relationships | trust in government]] and its ability to sustain changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Challenges to Maintaining Trust
Several factors can challenge the maintenance of [[citizen_engagement_and_trust_in_uncertain_times | citizen trust]]:
*   **Equitable Aid Distribution**: In complex federal systems, the efficient and equitable distribution of aid funds can be a struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. Inconsistencies in aid distribution can lead to differing perceptions of support, affecting public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>.
*   **Digital Literacy and Accessibility**: Rapid digitalization, such as the shift to online education, can expose disparities in digital literacy and access to technology across society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. If society cannot keep pace with government's digital advancements, it can hinder the effectiveness of new services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
*   **Politicization of Response**: The politicization of crisis responses can make it challenging to gain acceptance and compliance with protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. This can also influence citizens' willingness to subscribe to government assistance programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>.

## Strategies for Building Trust
To foster and sustain [[building_trust_through_effective_public_administration | citizen trust]], several strategies are important:
*   **Inclusion of the Public**: Including the public in the process of developing solutions is crucial to build trust and buy-in in advance of future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Basing decisions on data, including insights on mobility, patient numbers, and economic strength, helps in designing effective and trusted measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.
*   **Increased Collaboration**: Fostering collaboration within government, between government and society, and among nations helps in designing bottom-up solutions and de-formalizing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.
*   **Nurturing Human Capital**: Attracting and retaining talented, motivated individuals in the public service and continuously investing in their learning are key to enhancing government's capacity and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. The crisis has given public servants a shared sense of purpose, which can attract more skilled individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.
*   **Strategic Digitalization and Foresight**: Investing in digital technologies and data utilization allows for better decision-making and service provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. Furthermore, governments need to shift from solely focusing on risk management to dedicating more time to foresight and scenario planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.
*   **Promoting an Entrepreneurial Mindset**: Encouraging an entrepreneurial culture within the public sector, where experimentation is embraced and cultural aversion to risk is reduced, can lead to more responsive and effective governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. This means challenging habits and focusing on clear missions with autonomy for front-line decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

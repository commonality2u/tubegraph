The concept of "digital by default" in public services, while offering many opportunities, also presents several significant [[challenges_and_opportunities_of_digitalization_in_public_services | challenges]] that require careful consideration to ensure inclusive and effective service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. It is crucial to think about users when making the most of digital opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## User-Centricity and Accessibility Concerns

A primary challenge is remembering that services need to meet the expectations of final users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Not all citizens want or are able to use digital channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Key challenges include:
*   **Closing in-person access to government** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Skills and capabilities of citizens** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Many citizens, particularly in Slovenia, lack digital identity necessary to access advanced administrative services remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. In France, a large part of the population is uncomfortable using digital services, often due to lack of a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. In Portugal, a significant percentage of the population has never used the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.
*   **Access to the internet in society** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Accessibility needs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Services must be inclusive and accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. The principle is that digital by design for government does not mean compulsory digital by default for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

## Internal Government Challenges

While citizens expect government to be "digital by default" in the wake of events like COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, the internal landscape of public administration presents its own hurdles:
*   **Lack of collaboration inside government to solve problems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Public services often do not stop at departmental boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Difficulties in getting access to data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Different silos in government that operate services in different places** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Overcoming problems in connecting different silos within public sector organizations is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent multi-channel performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. User digital journeys are often interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   A "digital by default" mindset can limit thinking, leading to disconnected experiences if digital and traditional services are treated as entirely separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. For example, some may see supporting physical letters on a notification platform as "going backwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   If public servants lack the [[importance_of_digital_literacy | skills]] and capabilities for new ways of working, such as agile methods, government cannot react quickly enough to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   The complexity of simplifying services at their core requires significant research and direct engagement with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. A lack of sufficient direct interaction with people and confronting them with services to ensure suitability is a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
*   Communication around services needs to be accessible and understandable by everyone, simplifying complex or technical language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges

To address these challenges, governments are focusing on:
*   Ensuring access provides the same opportunities to all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Adopting a "system thinking approach" that is forward-looking rather than purely reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   Investing in [[importance_of_digital_literacy | skills]] across the public sector and among users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   Promoting an [[adapting_public_administration_for_digital_transformation | agile]] [[digital_advancements_and_accessibility_challenges_in_public_innovation | digital mindset]] within the administration, including investing in in-house skills, new ways of working, and infrastructure like shared components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   Developing strategies like the planned introduction of an electronic identity card to provide citizens with an effective "ticket to the digital world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   Improving coordination and connectedness for the benefit of all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:38">[01:26:38]</a>.
*   The OECD Digital Government Policy Framework aims to help governments overcome remaining obstacles and deliver services that meet user expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Ultimately, "digital by default" must not mean "digital only" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. The goal is to provide services to citizens, which sometimes requires multiple channels, including traditional physical ones, to ensure [[inclusive_digital_participation_and_accessibility | inclusivity]] and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

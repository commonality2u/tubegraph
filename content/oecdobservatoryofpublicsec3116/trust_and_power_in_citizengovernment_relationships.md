The relationship between government and citizens is undergoing a significant shift, driven by various democratic innovations across local, regional, national, and international levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This evolution is crucial for the future of democracy, especially given perceptions of a democratic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## The Shifting Paradigm: From Consumers to Citizens

Historically, the relationship between individuals and organizations, including the state, has often been framed as a "consumer relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. In this model, citizens are expected to choose from options presented to them, rather than actively shaping those options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This is likened to "choosing from the items on the menu" instead of "being allowed in the kitchen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

The "New Citizenship Project" aims to reframe this view, challenging the consumer-centric model and instead seeing people as citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The goal is to infuse the same creativity and energy into the democratic relationship as is currently directed towards consumerism, making democracy joyful, meaningful, and dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This shift is seen not as a "nice to have," but as an "existential challenge" to bolster and build up democracy against potential loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

The concept of citizens as "agents of change" opens up new possibilities in democratic engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## The Core Challenge: [[The role of trust between government and society | Trust and Power]]

A significant aspect of the changing relationship is the decline in [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | citizen trust]] in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Conversely, there is also a question of how much government trusts citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Despite this, people are more engaged than ever on issues affecting them and their communities, wanting to contribute meaningfully to decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Shifting Power Dynamics
Democratic innovations are designed to shift power towards citizens, enabling them to inform and shape policies and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The fundamental question revolves around where power meaningfully lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. For the shift to be real, governments must [[building_trust_in_public_institutions | trust citizens]] and place meaningful power in their hands, otherwise, it risks being merely a co-opting exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

### Follow-up and Accountability
A critical concern for democratic innovations is ensuring that citizen proposals are translated into actual initiatives and subjected to accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. Without clear follow-up, participants may feel let down or disappointed, undermining the effort and potentially becoming counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. This requires different notions of legitimacy and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

It is important to be clear with citizens about the extent to which their recommendations will be implemented, as participatory processes are not direct democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. Providing a commitment, such as following up on a certain percentage of recommendations, could help manage expectations and allow for clear evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.

## Democratic Innovations in Practice

### Agora Brussels
Agora Brussels is an initiative that seeks to install a permanent citizen's assembly as a deliberative body of randomly selected citizens who have a real say in policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. By running for office and securing a parliamentary seat, Agora can organize citizen assemblies and defend their decisions in parliament, giving citizens a direct voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This approach aims to "give the city back to its citizens," making them agents of their own political change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### We Do Democracy (Denmark)
We Do Democracy works on redesigning and revitalizing democracy, emphasizing that democracy is a design that can be restructured based on context and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. They promote the concept of "democratic fitness," encouraging the active practice and training of "democratic muscles" like listening, empathy, and compromising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This approach aims to strengthen democratic competence to solve societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### Conference on the Future of Europe
This large-scale democratic participatory exercise has a strong deliberative dimension, notably through European Citizens Panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. These panels involve randomly selected citizens reflecting on Europe's future, highlighting the transnational dimension of democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. The conference relies on three main elements:
1.  **Digital Platform:** A multilingual digital platform for individual contributions and reports from local events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.
2.  **Panels:** Four European Citizens Panels, each with 200 participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
3.  **Plenary:** A unique assembly mixing citizens, national parliamentarians, European parliamentarians, and representatives from governments and local authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

There is a sense that the conference is fostering a "silent revolution" by prioritizing citizens and changing political culture, with the intention for more permanent tools for citizen participation after the conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. However, concerns remain about the concrete follow-up and the real impact on policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

## Digital vs. Physical Spaces in Democracy

A growing concern is the increasing time spent in front of screens (averaging 13 hours per day during lockdowns), potentially leading to a disconnection from physical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. This trend raises questions about the future of democracy, particularly the importance of physical interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

The privatization of public space, both online and offline, is also a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. When platforms for political discussion are based on consumption and advertising models, it creates an unhealthy dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. Spending time on private platforms like Twitter and Facebook for "democracy" activities is seen as feeding "digital capitalism" or "surveillance capitalism," rather than genuinely establishing digital democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. There's a suggestion that individuals should be compensated for their data when using devices that track them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

## Challenges and Tensions in the Transition

The transition to more participatory forms of democracy involves "birthing pains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. While there is a push for more initiatives, a tension exists between doing things well in a meaningful, power-shifting way and the risk of initiatives being ignored or undermining public confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.

Some express concern that change is happening too slowly and that one-off projects can be used by policymakers to "cherry-pick" recommendations, implementing only what aligns with existing plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>. This highlights the need for transparency: "say what you do and do what you say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>.

The emerging forms of citizen participation, such as citizen assemblies, can be conceptualized as new forms of representation, where participants act as citizen representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>. This perspective encourages redesigning existing representative democracy rather than simply replacing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.

## Measuring Impact and Cultivating Hope

Beyond legislative changes, the impact of democratic initiatives can be broader, including:
*   [[building_trust_in_public_institutions | Trust building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>
*   Stronger networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>
*   Meeting diverse people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>
*   Inspiration for new forms of participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>
*   Enhanced feelings of engagement and political efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>

This broader view requires a new language for discussing democratic impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>.

Regarding the future of democracy, while there are concerning trends, a distinction is made between optimism and hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Optimism is the belief that things will be fine regardless of action, while hope is defined as "a combination of clarity and imagination" – the clarity to see the world as it is and the imagination to envision what could be if people get involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.

A "cultural change in the media" is also needed to encourage reporting on innovative and peaceful democratic interactions, rather than just conflictual political events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>. Increased media visibility is seen as necessary to ensure impact and encourage politicians to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.

## Moving Forward: Personal Commitments and Future Directions

Personal commitments to driving change include:
*   **[[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | Trusting the people]] and shifting to people-centered solutions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. This involves identifying target groups, engaging through anthropological approaches and face-to-face interaction, interpreting solutions with them, and continually testing and iterating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>.
*   **Recognizing the role of the private sector** in democratic innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. Entrepreneurs can bring fast-paced, risk-willing energy to build solutions, bridging the gap between public sector and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.
*   **Fostering physical democratic spaces** like Copenhagen's "Democracy Garage," which serve as service centers for deliberative democracy, building specific solutions to cultural problems, and bridging silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.
*   **Continuously pointing policymakers to the importance of listening to citizens** and engaging in more inclusive, deliberative, and impactful democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>. The goal is to move towards cities and governance that are "by and for its citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.

Overall, while progress is being made and positive change is happening, the ultimate goal of truly shifting power relationships in citizen-government interactions requires further steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>.

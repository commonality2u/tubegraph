Innovation is fundamentally local, driven by individuals within communities who face challenges and devise solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This perspective views innovators as the people themselves living in communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. It's crucial to acknowledge that innovation isn't solely a top-down process where governments create the environment for it to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Instead, it's about recognizing the innovators already present in communities and then encouraging and guiding their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Characteristics of Local Innovation

Local innovations are often highly contextualized, meaning they are adapted to specific needs and may not always require scaling to a broader level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. They frequently involve:
*   **Frugal Innovation**: This approach focuses on "doing more and better for more people with less resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. It's inspired by individuals in challenging situations who use existing resources to substitute for what they lack, creating ingenious and highly affordable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.
*   **Repurposing and Adaptation**: Existing capabilities, infrastructure, or even materials are creatively reused or adapted to new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Examples include using textile manufacturers to make masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, converting train compartments into mobile wards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>, or repurposing readily available drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
*   **Inclusivity**: Local innovation often emerges from and benefits vulnerable populations, ensuring that solutions reach the poorest and most marginalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This includes recognizing "positive deviants" â€“ outliers who find effective solutions despite facing similar challenges as their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

## Role of Governments and International Community

Governments and international partners play a critical role in fostering [[innovation_ecosystems|innovation ecosystems]] for local and regional impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>:
*   **Steering and Nurturing**: Rather than controlling or duplicating others' activities, governments should coordinate, facilitate, and nurture innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. The analogy is to "steer" rather than "row" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Creating Enabling Environments**: This includes setting up frameworks like:
    *   **Innovation Sandboxes**: Providing funding and mentorship for local innovators to experiment and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Malaysia's Global Innovation Center, for instance, offers matching grants for social enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
    *   **Platforms for Collaboration**: Digital platforms can connect innovators with ideas to organizations that can help scale them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Examples include USAID's Million Lives Club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a> and the Commonwealth Secretariat's digital platform for member countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
    *   **Strategic Procurement**: Government procurement can act as a powerful incentive to align private sector efforts with public needs, such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
    *   **Incentives and Disincentives**: Budgetary measures can encourage private sector participation in "nation-building" efforts that enhance citizen welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.
*   **Investing Locally**: Donors should prioritize investing in local structures that drive innovation, as this is often more cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. This means supporting efforts from grassroots communities and local organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.
*   **Regional Approaches**: Fostering regional cooperation in areas like health can pool resources, research, and innovation pertinent to a specific region's unique attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.
*   **Taking Risks**: Donors and governments need to be willing to take more risks to enable locally-driven innovations, especially in areas like innovative financing and supporting social entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities

The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted both [[challenges_in_building_innovation_ecosystems|challenges in building innovation ecosystems]] and opportunities:
*   **Constraints for Innovators**: Good ideas face significant hurdles, including regulatory navigation, behavior change, and stakeholder coordination for deployment at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
*   **Financing Gap**: Economic recessions lead to massive outflows of private capital from low- and middle-income countries, widening the financing gap for SDGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.
*   **Catalyzing Investment**: [[publicprivate_partnerships_in_innovation|Public-private partnerships]] and blended finance models are crucial to attract investment capital beyond traditional grants, potentially at sub-market rates, to grow the resource pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.
*   **Connecting Ideas to Application**: There's a "global pile-up of innovations" that needs to be converted into a true pipeline for adoption and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. This requires understanding local contexts and curating the best global ideas for specific local needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>.
*   **Interconnectedness**: Innovations must address complex, multi-sectoral needs beyond just health, considering environmental, economic, and social impacts holistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.
*   **Citizen Co-design**: Citizens, including grassroots innovators and social enterprises, can act as co-designers of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. Governments and corporations should create spaces for these actors to collaborate and bring their early-stage ideas to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.

## Examples of Local and Regional Innovation

*   **Malaysia's Global Innovation Center**: Creates an [[innovation_ecosystems|innovation ecosystem]] with funding, mentorship, and matching grants to stimulate innovation and support social enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. It also promotes a regional approach within ASEAN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **M Hero in Liberia**: A two-way communication platform for the Ministry of Health to connect with frontline community health workers, initially funded during the Ebola outbreak and repurposed for COVID-19 response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Shift Labs' Drip Assist**: An innovation that helps healthcare workers monitor IV infusion rates, costing a tenth of typical pumps, running on a single AA battery, and requiring less than 10 minutes of training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Project Last Mile, South Africa**: A [[publicprivate_partnerships_in_innovation|public-private partnership]] in the Western Cape enabling local manufacturers to produce textile masks for their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   **Community Maker Spaces in India**: Local communities quickly organized to make face masks using readily available materials like transparency sheets, delivering them to frontline workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   **Islamic Social Financing in Malaysia**: Experimenting with instruments like the *sukuk* model and Islamic bonds, which were oversubscribed, to empower local women and communities for livelihood development and health initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.
*   **Pooling Logistics Resources in Malaysia**: Utilizing tourist buses and vans from private companies to create an "Uber-like" transportation system for moving nurses and resources in remote areas of Sabah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

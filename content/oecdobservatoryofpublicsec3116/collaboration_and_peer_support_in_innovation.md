[[Public sector innovation and collaboration | Public sector innovation]] is a driving force of change, often requiring a concerted push to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This need for support has led to initiatives focused on fostering [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaboration]] and peer learning.

## The Innovation Incubator Program
The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), in partnership with the European Commission, established the Innovation Incubator Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This incubator aims to assist countries in exploring more radical innovations and anticipating future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Denmark, Romania, and Portugal participated in its pilot phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The program provides participating countries with vital resources, including:
*   International expert advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Peer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Co-design elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

## Anticipatory Innovation and Knowledge Sharing
Anticipatory innovation empowers governments to take future-oriented actions, enabling a proactive approach to societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Under the incubator's guidance, Portugal developed an "Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This kit is designed for public service servants and managers new to anticipatory innovation, aiming to introduce the concept in an easy-to-understand, assess, and use manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Disseminating Lessons Learned
Sharing experiences among innovators is crucial for mutual learning and for disseminating positive contributions across the entire community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. To this end, OPSI partnered with Accelerate Estonia to help disseminate lessons learned from the Innovation Incubator experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Accelerate Estonia specializes in accelerating change by identifying societal problems and finding [[publicprivate_partnerships_for_innovation | public private partnerships]] that transform these challenges into opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Together, OPSI and Accelerate Estonia have developed tools for incubating innovation projects, which governments can access on OPSI's website and adapt to their specific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## OPSI's Role in Global Innovation
OPSI serves as a global forum for [[public_sector_innovation_and_collaboration | public sector innovation]], supporting governments in understanding, testing, and embedding new initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Their work contributes to addressing societal challenges, ultimately ensuring that better services and policies lead to improved lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

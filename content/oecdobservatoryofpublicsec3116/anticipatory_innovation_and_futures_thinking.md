The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) is working to develop and test approaches for creating [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Role of Futures Thinking
OPSI aims to use novel approaches for [[futures_thinking | futures thinking]] to support the development of innovation ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This approach helps these ecosystems become more future-oriented in their goals and activities, enabling them to identify threats and opportunities not just in the present, but also in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Context within Innovation Ecosystems
The concept of [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] is seen as central to the work of the Investment and Development Agency of Latvia (LIAA), which is undertaking an ambitious project to foster [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This work recognizes that innovation is increasingly facilitated through the intricate interweaving of relationships among diverse actors with varied interests and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Orchestration and Future Orientation
The orchestration and future orientation of innovation ecosystems is a complex task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It requires governments and agencies to be able to listen and identify what is missing, and then work to bridge the gaps between ideas and new products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. By developing innovation ecosystems, the goal is to help stakeholders perceive each other and their environment more clearly, aiding in the identification of threats and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This support encourages stakeholders to recognize their complementarities, draw on each other's capabilities, adjust activities, and foster coordinated creative relationships where new things are continually created in response to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

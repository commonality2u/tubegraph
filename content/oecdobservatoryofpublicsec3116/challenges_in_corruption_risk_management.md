This article explores the [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges faced by governments]] in effectively managing corruption risks within public administration, drawing insights from a project conducted in the Slovak Republic by the OECD, in partnership with Slovak institutions [00:02:42]. The project emphasizes the application of behavioral insights to strengthen public integrity and prevent corruption [00:03:01].

## Context of the Slovak Project
The project, spanning four years, aimed to improve capacities in the Slovak public administration to reinforce integrity [00:02:51]. It involved analytical work, capacity building for civil servants to implement integrity measures, and the development of concrete tools [00:03:08]. The initiative focused on four key areas [00:03:25]:
1.  **Strategic Approach**: Incorporating a strategic approach to inform integrity policies, primarily under the framework of the former National Anti-Corruption Policy of the Slovak Republic [00:03:30].
2.  **Horizontal Coordination**: Improving coordination across integrity functions among different stakeholders to implement the strategic approach [00:03:48].
3.  **Whole-of-Society Engagement**: Engaging the whole of society in integrity efforts to ensure fit-for-purpose integrity reforms [00:04:05].
4.  **Behavioral Risk-Based Approach**: Applying a behavioral risk-based approach to corruption prevention [00:04:18]. This approach is crucial for identifying pressing risks in public institutions, mitigating them, and strengthening civil servant accountability [00:04:29].

The project built upon the Integrity Review of the Slovak Republic, published in 2022, which provided a 360-degree view of the Slovak integrity system [00:04:52]. A key finding was that while Slovakia had implemented measures to strengthen corruption risk management, the practical application of these frameworks was still lagging [00:05:21]. This challenge is not unique to Slovakia, as many OECD countries struggle with consistently applying corruption risk management frameworks in practice [00:05:46].

## Behavioral Insights for Public Integrity
The project's work is based on the OECD Recommendation on Public Integrity, launched in 2017 [00:07:47]. This recommendation offers a sustainable and strategic approach to fighting corruption by shifting focus from ad-hoc policies to a context-dependent, behavioral risk-based approach [00:08:09]. It also emphasizes cultivating a culture of integrity across society, involving public servants, businesses, civil society organizations, and citizens [00:08:27].

The behavioral approach invites policymakers to analyze and observe real behaviors before implementing policies at a larger scale, rather than making assumptions [00:09:04]. This approach has two main implications for policy [00:10:04]:
1.  **Supporting Ethical Choices**: Traditional anti-corruption measures often assume people will act corruptly if benefits outweigh costs [00:10:16]. However, behavioral research shows that most people possess an internal "moral compass" and try to act with integrity, even when unobserved [00:10:42]. While some may still act unethically, they often find justifications to perceive themselves as honest [00:11:00]. This suggests that policy should not exclusively focus on corrupt individuals but empower the majority of public officials who wish to act correctly, creating an environment that supports ethical choices and open discussion of concerns [00:11:42].
2.  **Ensuring Effective Implementation of Integrity Policies**: Even well-intentioned integrity policies can fail to achieve desired impact or backfire if the real behaviors of public officials are not considered during implementation [00:13:13]. Integrity policies encompass areas like corruption risk management, internal and external audits, conflict of interest management, and integrity communication [00:12:49].

Since 2018, the OECD has conducted further work applying behavioral insights to public integrity, including studies on corruption risk management, audit reports, and leadership, involving countries like Brazil, Romania, Chile, and the Slovak Republic [00:13:34].

## The Slovak Experiment: Preventing Corruption in Public Administration
The experiment focused on how to prevent corruption in the Slovak public administration, specifically empowering public sector employees to detect and report corruption risks safely [00:14:48].

### Methodology: BASIC Framework
The project followed the BASIC framework for applied behavioral science, developed by the OECD in 2019 [00:15:31]:
*   **B - Behavior**: Understanding the specific behavior to change and determining if behavioral science is the appropriate tool [00:15:52].
*   **A - Analysis**: Investigating why the behavior occurs, including context and social norms [00:16:07].
*   **S - Strategy**: Identifying behavioral strategies to counter identified biases [00:16:20].
*   **I - Intervention**: Empirically testing interventions in practice to learn what works [00:16:34].
*   **C - Change**: Scaling up successful interventions to create lasting change [00:16:52].

### Targeted Behaviors and Barriers
Through conversations with anti-corruption coordinators and interviews with public officials, four key behaviors related to corruption prevention were identified [00:17:14]:
1.  **"Ticking the Box" Behavior**: Managers formally complying with rules but not acting in line with the code of conduct [00:17:42].
2.  **Misreporting**: Managers misreporting progress, particularly related to the National Recovery and Resilience Plan [00:18:03].
3.  **Underused Electronic Survey**: Managers not encouraging use of an existing electronic survey for reporting corruption risks, leading to low employee usage [00:18:24].
4.  **Employee Reluctance to Speak Up**: A prevailing "culture of fear" or silence preventing employees from reporting *potential* corruption risks, even if they would report an incident [00:18:47].

The experiment narrowed its focus to the reluctance of employees to speak up about corruption risks [00:20:31]. The reasons for this reluctance included [00:21:11]:
*   **Lack of Leadership Example**: Leaders/managers themselves not speaking up [00:21:15].
*   **Limited Understanding of Channels**: Employees were unaware of existing reporting channels (e.g., electronic survey, managers) [00:21:31].
*   **Psychological Costs/Fear of Retaliation**: Perception of risks like retaliation deterred reporting [00:21:55].
*   **Lack of Feedback Mechanism**: No clear feedback loop after reporting, making employees feel their reports weren't acted upon [00:22:47].
*   **Unclear Definition of "Risk"**: Employees understood reporting incidents but were uncertain about reporting *potential* risks [00:23:46].

The experiment specifically aimed to address two barriers: the lack of understanding of what constitutes a reportable risk and the lack of good examples from leaders [00:24:46].

### Experiment Design
A randomized vignette experiment was conducted to increase risk communication [00:25:06].
*   **Population**: All people working in Slovak line Ministries and central authorities [00:26:17].
*   **Procedure**: Participants received an email with a link to a survey [00:26:24]. In the survey, respondents were shown a vignette describing a hypothetical situation where a risk should ideally be reported [00:26:33].
*   **Vignette Example**: A civil servant suspects a lack of control measures in hiring procedures, leading to potential conflicts of interest, as public officials with personal relationships to senior managers may have been hired [00:27:15].
*   **Groups**: The population was randomized into three groups [00:25:16]:
    *   **Control Group**: Received no intervention [00:25:21].
    *   **Treatment 1 (Understanding Risk)**: Received a message aimed at improving understanding of a risk by giving an analogy from a health context (e.g., speaking to a doctor about risk factors like smoking to diagnose cancer) [00:27:52].
    *   **Treatment 2 (Exemplary Leadership)**: Received a message appealing to exemplary leadership (e.g., "Imagine your manager leads by example...they encourage you and your colleagues to do the same") [00:28:47].
*   **Common Element**: Both treatment messages also applied injunctive social norms, reminding participants that "every civil servant should be honest and speak about corruption risks" [00:29:29].
*   **Incentive**: To encourage participation, a lottery offered three participants a 15-minute chat with the Prime Minister at the time [00:29:58].
*   **Sample**: 2,537 respondents participated, with approximately equal numbers in each group [00:30:33]. The age distribution showed peaks around tens, suggesting approximations were given [00:30:51].

### Experiment Results
*   **Baseline Reporting Likelihood**: In the control group (no intervention), the likelihood of communicating a risk was 48% [00:31:47].
*   **Impact of Leadership Message**: Employees who saw the leadership message were approximately 14 percentage points more likely to communicate a risk compared to the control group [00:33:27]. This was the most impactful message [00:33:39].
*   **Impact of Understanding Risk Message**: Employees who saw the understanding of risks message were approximately 9 percentage points more likely to communicate a risk compared to the control group [00:33:42].
*   **Overall Impact**: The experiment successfully demonstrated that behavioral insights could increase integrity among public officials [00:33:56].
*   **Age Correlation**: Younger respondents were more likely to communicate a corruption risk [00:34:15]. An increase in age by one year decreased the likelihood to communicate an integrity risk by 0.23 percentage points [00:34:27]. Career length in public administration was not found to correlate with the likelihood to communicate a risk [00:34:37].
*   **Feeling of Safety**: People generally reported feeling safer communicating a risk after being asked whom they would communicate it to [00:35:00]. Both treatments increased the feeling of safety, though the effect sizes were small (around three percentage points) [00:35:32]. The majority of respondents preferred communicating a risk to their manager [00:36:00]. Senior respondents were less likely to feel safe communicating a risk after being asked whom they preferred communicating it to [00:36:21].
*   **Trust in System**: Trust in the risk management system was not correlated with the two treatments [00:36:40]. However, people who trusted the risk management system were more likely to feel safe and communicate corruption risks [00:37:01].
*   **Understanding of Risk**: Only 30.8% of respondents correctly identified the vignette situation as a corruption risk (rather than an incident or not communicating) [00:37:40]. Neither treatment significantly improved the understanding of a risk among respondents [00:38:02].

## Recommendations and Implications
Based on these findings, three main axes of work are recommended for Slovakia's new National Anti-Corruption Strategy (2024-2029) [00:38:52]:

1.  **Empower Leaders to Set the Standard**: Since leadership example was the most effective intervention, it is crucial to empower leaders through training, equipping them with knowledge, skills, and resources to act with integrity themselves [00:39:28]. Anti-corruption coordinators also have a key role, and cross-agency collaboration is recommended to redefine and develop code of conduct guidelines [00:39:52]. This aligns with insights on the [[impact_of_leadership_on_reporting_corruption | impact of leadership on reporting corruption]].

2.  **Make Risk Communication Easy and Well Understood**: The process for reporting risks must be simple and clear [00:40:18]. Given employees' preference to report to managers, policies should ensure this is a safe and known option [00:40:37]. Raising awareness of existing channels, like electronic surveys, and implementing clear, concise, behaviorally informed guidelines are vital [00:41:02].

3.  **Cultivate a Culture of Safety**: Feelings of safety are key enablers for speaking up [00:41:41]. Fostering an organizational culture where speaking up is a social norm is essential [00:41:48].

The study is considered ambitious and atypical for applied behavioral insights projects, as it tackles a sensitive "wicked problem" like anti-corruption [00:53:57]. The use of vignettes and randomized assignment helps establish causal connections between interventions and behavioral changes, minimizing social desirability bias [00:45:59]. The magnitude of the observed effects—a significant increase in reporting likelihood by merely changing a few words—highlights the power of behavioral public policy [00:48:16].

Experts emphasized the value of this project in providing concrete lines of action [01:09:31]. Future work could explore incorporating peer beliefs, conducting larger-scale "real-world" experiments across multiple public administrations, and testing the long-term impact of training [00:55:55]. Analogies are crucial for understanding, and the data suggests that people generally want to report when given a cue [01:11:20]. However, potential spillovers in multi-office experiments and the "ticking the box" behavior of leadership (which can drain employee power) are important considerations for future efforts [01:13:48].

The finding that younger employees are more likely to report risks is noteworthy [01:17:49]. This could be due to a lower opportunity cost, less fear of retaliation, or different beliefs about the system compared to older, more senior civil servants who may have been exposed to corruption or bad practices for longer [01:20:46]. It may also reflect a generational shift in socio-cultural context and a greater exposure to communication about ethics and integrity [01:21:50].

Ultimately, the project confirms that encouraging risk communication is a foundational step for effective corruption risk management [01:24:24]. Simplifying methodological guidance and designing effective mitigation measures are the crucial next steps once risks are known and reported [01:24:51]. This type of behavioral approach is seen as a vital mirror for society, highlighting areas for improvement and informing future anti-corruption efforts, including potentially starting integrity education earlier at universities or high schools [01:26:56].

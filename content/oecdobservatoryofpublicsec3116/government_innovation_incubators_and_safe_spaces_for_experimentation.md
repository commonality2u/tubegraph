Government innovation incubators provide a critical environment for public sector teams to collaborate, learn, and develop solutions to complex challenges. These initiatives are characterized by an experimental approach, fostering a "safe space" where participants can exchange ideas and gain insights without the pressure of guaranteed success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This approach acknowledges that the journey of innovation is not always "flashy or flawless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## The Innovation Incubator Model

The [[innovation_incubator_program | Innovation Incubator]] is designed as a safe space for exchanging and learning, enabling participants to comfortably present their ideas without feeling the need to compromise their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This incubation process itself is an [[experimentation_in_government_innovation | experimental initiative]], continually refined through participant feedback and iterative loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

Key aspects of this model include:
*   **Value Creation** Delivering value to projects and creating impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-Border Collaboration** Setting up a secure environment for teams to work together across international borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Mutual Learning** Providing an opportunity for participants to learn collectively and improve processes by accumulating shared knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

### Insights from Global Exploration

An exploration of 88 existing incubators and accelerators in the public sector revealed two significant takeaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>:
1.  **Border Barriers** International borders still impede [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation | government collaboration]], unlike other sectors that have achieved greater cross-border efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
2.  **Need for Shared Platforms** There is a clear need to strengthen cross-border collaboration by creating shared platforms. This is crucial because many challenges are transversal, crossing borders, and even when not, similar challenges can benefit from shared tools, learnings, and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

These insights led to the development of a government-to-government [[innovation_incubator_program | Innovation Incubator]] model that specifically promotes cross-border collaboration among governments facing similar innovation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

### Value Proposition

The program's value proposition is built on several pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>:
*   **Peer Learning** Facilitating learning among participating government teams.
*   **Expert Contributions** Integrating insights and learnings from external experts to enrich the process.
*   **Recognition and Visibility** Acknowledging and providing visibility to government teams for their impactful initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term Support** Emphasizing weaving close relationships and building trust among teams, rather than focusing on one-off events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## The Role of Experimentation and "Failure"

The philosophy behind these incubators embraces [[experimentation_in_government_innovation | experimentation in government innovation]] and the acceptance of "failure" as a crucial component of the learning journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

> "failing and failure is really an essential part of any Journey [...] without failure there is no learning and if there is no learning then there's not no innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>

This approach is vital because, in the public sector, the direct application of new solutions often leaves no room for error. However, a safe space like an incubator allows participants to explore uncertainties, seek advice from peers, and learn from both successes and challenges faced by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>. This fosters a "critical friend" environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.

## Building and Orchestrating Innovation Ecosystems

The [[innovation_incubator_program | Innovation Incubator]] operates within a broader [[building_and_orchestrating_innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystem]], aiming to transform "blind spots" where borders hinder collaboration into "sweet spots" by focusing on overcoming these obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. This promotes a [[framework_for_innovation_in_the_public_sector | framework for innovation in the public sector]] that goes beyond individual projects to support organizational development and the scaling of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.

> "we a lot less successful when it comes to embedding the new Solutions into the existing system and CL scaling the new Solutions and learning from The Innovation process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>

The program's design, including its cohort-based learning track, seeks to amplify impact by creating an inclusive approach that brings together a diverse range of government teams and challenges from around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This global exchange allows for the sharing of best practices, criticisms, and new ideas, pushing forward [[government_innovation_and_adaptation | government innovation and adaptation]] and ensuring that valuable projects do not remain small and local <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:34">[01:05:34]</a>.

The overarching goal is to connect governments across borders and support experimental processes, ultimately delivering value to public administrations and improving citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:05">[01:19:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

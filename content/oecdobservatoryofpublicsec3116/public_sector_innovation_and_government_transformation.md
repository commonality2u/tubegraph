This article summarizes discussions from the Government Aftershock high-level forum, focusing on the role and expectations of government in addressing modern-day challenges through [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The forum convenes a global dialogue on crises and challenges, aiming to develop a global call to action for government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Forum Overview
The forum brought together over 4,500 participants in more than 60 local conversations worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The 21 sessions contribute to a global call to action for government, developed at the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This specific session discusses the annual work in surfacing key global [[Public sector innovation trends]] and case studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The OECD Observatory of [[Public sector innovation]] (OPSI) and the UAE Muhammad bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation have partnered since 2016 to highlight [[Public sector innovation trends]] and cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Key Innovation Trends and Reports
The year 2020 saw a significant shift in government agendas due to COVID-19, leading to adjustments in the innovation trend exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A solid knowledge base, including 683 cases from 91 countries and 450 cases from the COVID-19 Innovative Response Tracker, informed the discussion around five key trends in government innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. These trends are detailed in five reports, available at `trends.oecd-opsi.org` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The five key trends and associated reports are:
1.  **Innovative responses to the COVID-19 crisis** Governments rapidly stepped up to take action under exceptional circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Seamless government** This concept focuses on eliminating friction points between government machinery and the public it serves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
3.  **Focusing on the overlooked** This report highlights innovations addressing the needs of societal segments at risk of falling through the cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
4.  **Using powerful new technologies** This discusses the tensions governments face when using new technologies that provide insights while mitigating harm to freedom and rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
5.  **Upskilling and investing in people** The fifth and final report explores how governments are upskilling and investing in people in innovative ways, covering investing in the public as a critical resource and upskilling public service to unlock government potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Case Studies and Innovator Insights

### The UAE Ministry of Possibilities: Building Agility in Government
A case study in seamless government is the UAE Ministry of Possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This virtual ministry, launched in 2017 as part of the UAE's Centennial Plan Vision 2071, aims to be the best nation in the world by 2071 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

*   **Purpose**: The ministry was created to incubate and solve systemic challenges and "impossibilities" within government, operating as a neutral space close enough to core government missions but removed from traditional bureaucratic limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Structure**: It has no single active minister, relying instead on time-bound departments each focused on a priority national portfolio or "wicked question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Methodology**: It applies design thinking and experimentation to develop proactive and disruptive solutions, bringing together federal, local government teams, private sector, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Mission Pillars**:
    *   Identify impossibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    *   Incubate virtual time-bound departments/teams to solve and explore the impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
    *   Educate and train individuals on the mindset of design and experimentation in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    *   Inspire other governments with the UAE methodology of possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Challenges**:
    *   Initiating projects with unknown solutions or envisioned end states, contrary to the government environment of certainty and clear goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
    *   Team members adapting to agile working methods focused on continuous iterations based on user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Lessons Learned**:
    *   Importance of a common understanding of the "impossible" for collective progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
    *   Need for dedicated teams with specific competencies, not involved in other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
    *   Patience is key, as resistance to new approaches challenging existing beliefs and norms will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Future Hope**: To be a replicable model for other governments facing similar challenges, with documented methodologies to guide them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. The ministry protects those who try by providing a safe zone and legal permission away from current regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

### Hack the Crisis (Estonia): Rapid Response Innovation
Mick Vack, head of Accelerate Estonia, discussed "Hack the Crisis," featured in the report on innovative responses to COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Estonia operates an extremely digital society, with only three government services not online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Public-private cooperation is ingrained in Estonia's DNA, operating for over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

*   **Context**: Accelerate Estonia's mission is to find "perfect storms" of public-private collaboration that create new markets, similar to e-residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The focus is on societally important issues like mental health or the environment, not just technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
*   **Hackathon Launch**: On March 12, an email from the minister encouraged extraordinary suggestions. On March 13, Accelerate Estonia, with its private sector-experienced team, conceived an online hackathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Support from the minister was secured within an hour, necessary partnerships within two hours, and technology set up within six hours, using existing collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. The hackathon was opened by the minister and president on the evening of March 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
*   **Results**: The hackathon attracted 1,000 participants, with 30 teams finishing. Solutions included a government chatbot for citizen questions and physical assets like breathing ventilators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   **Impact**: The Estonian event inspired nearly 70 local events worldwide, including the EU vs. Virus hack and the Global Hack, engaging around 100,000 people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. This led to new companies and improved dialogue between the public and private sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
*   **Lessons Learned**:
    *   Government needs the capacity to absorb innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.
    *   High toll on mental health due to intense working weeks; need to give people room to breathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
    *   Crucial to have "free radicals" within government to adopt innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
    *   Urgency and a strong sense of mission are key for successful rapid innovation with the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
    *   Building connections with the private sector and tech community beforehand pays off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.

### Barefoot College: Empowering Overlooked Communities
Sue Stevenson, Director of Strategic Partnerships and International Development for Barefoot College International, discussed their work, featured in the report on focusing on the overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. Barefoot College, based in India, works with the world's poorest and most remote communities, founded on Gandhian principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

*   **Reach**: Programs operate in 93 countries across Latin America, Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and 14 Pacific Island states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. They have four regional training centers, with two more opening in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.
*   **Sustainable Development Goals**: Their programs address 14 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.
*   **Flagship Program**: An innovative, multi-faceted women-led clean energy program trains mostly illiterate and semi-literate women to be solar engineers, known as "Solar Mamas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
*   **Enrichment Co-Curriculum**: Based on community feedback, they developed an "Enrich" co-curriculum focusing on soft skills like aspirations, confidence, and competencies in financial inclusion, digital inclusion, women's health (especially reproductive health), microenterprise skills, civil society, human rights, and environmental sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. This ensures access to energy is leveraged into other competencies for long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.
*   **Community Model**: Trained women return to their communities to build, install, and maintain solar systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. Households pay a portion of what they used to spend on kerosene into a village fund, which pays the solar engineers' salaries and for replacement parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: Myriad benefits include light, ability to pump water (saving women time), better education outcomes (children's homework, extended day for adults), better health outcomes (no kerosene smoke), empowerment of women and girls, environmental sustainability, and livelihood development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. This "Power Platform" enables social and economic growth by putting education and technology in the hands of communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.
*   **Addressing Challenges**: Around one billion people lack energy access, with 600 million in Africa alone, often in rural areas too costly for grid reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. Access to energy and water solves significant time poverty issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. Empowering women as catalysts for development is critical, as they are often an untapped resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. A McKinsey report stated that gender parity could increase world GDP by 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.
*   **Government Partnerships**: Barefoot College works with governments, private organizations, and NGOs, seeking proactive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
    *   **Zanzibar**: The president emphasized Solar Mamas as part of their energy policy to reach last-mile communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.
    *   **Madagascar**: The government partnered in building a Regional Training Center, planning to train 744 solar engineers and electrify 630,000 homes by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.
    *   **Fiji**: The government is building a Regional Training Center, with the Minister for Women recognizing its key role in empowering rural women and driving rural prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.
*   **COVID-19 Response**: Barefoot College pivoted microenterprise training to help communities meet new needs, such as producing PPE in Zanzibar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. They reassessed supply chains and provided funding to prevent hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

### Elements of AI: Upskilling the Public
Timo Rus, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki and lead instructor of Elements of AI, presented this case study, featured in the report on upskilling and investing in the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

*   **Motivation**: To address the "societal cost of the mystification of AI," where public discourse is hindered by myths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>. Important decisions about societal thriving in the age of AI are political, not just technological, requiring informed regulation and direction of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>.
*   **Solution**: Provide accessible AI education for all levels, not just experts, to foster critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **The Course**: Elements of AI is a free online course (`www.elementsofai.com`) launched over two years ago with over half a million participants globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. No coding or complex math is required; it focuses on AI literacy and societal implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. It is rated as a top AI/computer science course and is a finalist for the Innovation in Politics award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.
*   **Initiative/Movement**: More than just a course, it involves grassroots activities and local partnerships to support adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.
    *   Started in English and Finnish in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.
    *   Expanded to Sweden, Estonia, and Germany in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
    *   Launched in Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, France, Belgium, Malta, Ireland, Poland, Croatia, and Italy, with plans to be in every EU country and language by summer 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   **Diversity of Participants**: Achieved 38% female users globally, and over 50% in Finland and Nordic countries, which is atypical for computer science courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. Users include working professionals and older adults (80-90 years old) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.
*   **Follow-up Course**: A second part, "Building AI," was launched recently, involving programming and more technical content, aiming to upskill people to innovate new solutions and manage AI projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. The goal is to transform people from AI consumers to contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.
*   **Sentiment**: AI is for everyone, learning about it is fun, and it leads to more educated opinions on its application, fostering policy dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.

## Challenges and Keys to Success in [[Public sector innovation]]
[[Public sector innovation]] is often perceived as difficult or impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. However, these cases prove impactful innovation is possible.

*   **Empowering Teams Across Departments**:
    *   The UAE Ministry of Possibilities empowers employees through "learning by doing" within a "safe zone" or sandbox space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. They protect those who try and provide legal permission away from current regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>. Strong leadership buy-in, like direct cabinet support, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.
    *   Creating synergies by bringing stakeholders (citizens, private sector, other government entities) on board early and making them part of the decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. Ministers or directors can champion time-bound departments, forming core and temporary teams from various users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.
*   **Role of [[Public sector innovation]] Labs**:
    *   Innovation Labs can identify and redesign outdated services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
    *   They should also look at systemic errors causing these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.
    *   Requires public sector agreement to give ideas a "lifeline" and explore systemic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.
    *   Important to be bold and go as deep as possible for better public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>.
    *   If a community doesn't want innovative solutions, it's better to start with parts of the ecosystem that do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.
*   **General Keys to Success**:
    *   **Trusting Science**: The COVID-19 crisis has fostered greater trust in science, which can be leveraged for other crises like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>.
    *   **Partnerships**: Public-private-NGO/social enterprise partnerships are absolutely key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
    *   **Proving Impact and Value**: Explaining the clear value and impact of an initiative helps secure buy-in from all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>.
    *   **Challenging Assumptions**: Always seek a second opinion if told something is impossible within government, as laws can be interpreted in various ways to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>.
    *   **Risk-Taking**: Governments undertake services too risky for the private sector, so they need public agreement to run those risks and find opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. More risky projects should be undertaken for both good and bad results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.
    *   **Strategic Alignment**: Initiatives like Elements of AI succeeded due to alignment with the government's existing commitment to digital literacy as a fundamental piece of societal resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. Sometimes, demonstrating positive impact first can lead to government support and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>.
    *   **Being Bold**: Be bold, aim big, and focus on doing something really well, even if it means not satisfying every small metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.

## Leveraging Innovative Momentum for the Future
The past year, while challenging, has underlined the importance of government and [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | government in partnership with others]], acting as a catalyst for [[Public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>.

*   **Doubling Down**: Continue the drive for partnerships (public, private, NGO, social enterprise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>. Focus on missions in crisis-hit areas requiring rapid innovation, such as mental health and accessibility to physical and digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. Do not forget commitments to a greener economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.
*   **Opportunities**:
    *   Leverage increased trust in science to address challenges like the climate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>.
    *   Recognize that change is possible, as demonstrated by responses to COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>.
    *   Accelerate existing strategies and plans that were previously stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. The UAE, for example, used the opportunity to announce a more agile and nimble government structure, including new ministerial portfolios for digital economy, AI, entrepreneurship, foreign trade, and advanced technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>.
    *   The creation of a Chief of Strategy and [[Public Sector Innovation]] for the UAE government signifies a strong commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>.
*   **Risks**:
    *   Dropping the ball on equality, as positive innovations might not be evenly distributed, potentially widening knowledge or skills gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>. New innovations are needed to ensure equal benefits for all citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
    *   The risk of new innovation labs or mission-based approaches merely maintaining usual procedures, leading to dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>. Dedication to truly doing things differently is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.

## Personal Reflections
*   **Doing More**: Continue the planned efforts and embrace the accelerated pace seen during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>. However, acknowledge that not everything can be digitized, maintaining a human-centric approach is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>.
*   **Courage and Boldness**: Be courageous in pursuing initiatives not explicitly expected, as they can yield significant impact beyond traditional metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Aim big and focus on doing something exceptionally well, even if it means neglecting some minor KPIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.
*   **Self-Care**: Recognize that continuous acceleration mode can lead to burnout. It is important to allocate time for reflection and self-care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>.

The Mission-Oriented Innovation Bootcamp Refresher, hosted by the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose (IIPP), served as a recap of the December boot camp, aimed at those who missed it or desired a refresher on its content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The bootcamp brought together OPSI, IIPP, IIPP's mission-oriented innovation network, government institutions, academics, and individuals from 36 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### What are Missions?

Missions represent a shift in how governments operate, moving beyond simply fixing market failures to actively shaping future markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. They provide a new policy framework to reorganize policymaking, focusing on achieving specific types of growth, particularly more equitable and green outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Instead of reacting to the private sector, governments embracing missions welcome uncertainty, take risks, and adopt a long-term view to direct the economy towards desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Missions are designed to break down traditional government silos, encouraging departments and agencies to work collaboratively with the private sector towards a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This approach aims to move beyond generic challenges to implement tangible changes in areas like mobility, food, and fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

#### Key Criteria for Missions (European Commission)

Based on a European Commission report authored by Mariana Mazzucato, missions should meet five key criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>:
*   **Inspirational** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>: They must motivate and be understandable to wider audiences, not just ambitious percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Clear and Targeted** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>: While inspirational, they must also have specific targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Invest in Research and Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>: Missions should drive investment in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sectoral and Cross-Disciplinary** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>: Missions should involve various sectors and disciplines, including behavioral aspects (e.g., how people eat, commute, dress) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **Support Multiple Solutions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>: Governments should enable a broad search for solutions by various actors like the private sector, universities, and NGOs, rather than dictating a single solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### The ROAR Framework

The ROAR framework captures key issues in [[mission_setting_and_implementation_strategies | mission setting and implementation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>:
*   **Directionality**: Defining a specific direction for economic growth and policies that are contextualized to challenges like Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Organizational Capabilities**: Building public organizations that can move beyond traditional grant-giving or loan schemes to become innovative themselves, changing public sector culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Assessment and Evaluation**: Developing new methodologies to [[evaluation_and_metrics_in_missionoriented_policy | evaluate and assess]] the impact of missions, especially when they create new markets, going beyond simple cost-benefit analyses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **Risk and Reward Sharing**: Addressing who invests and who benefits from the outcomes, as seen in the race for vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

### Making Missions Operational

OPSI's main interest lies in making missions operational and accessible to civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. This includes developing methods and working methods for [[mission_setting_and_implementation_strategies | mission setting]] and preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Tools like the "mission planning canvas" are being developed to assist governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

Missions are not the only type of innovation governments should support; other forms of innovation can also contribute to missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory Innovation**: Using futures and foresight to identify upcoming challenges that may require new high-level goals and missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation**: Improving current systems to meet the demands of mission goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Innovation**: Creating space for bottom-up innovations that can support the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Challenges and Insights in Mission Implementation

The growing role of [[impact_and_scaling_of_mission_oriented_policies | Mission oriented Innovation policies]] is evident, but challenges remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>:
*   **Defining Missions**: New policies often need help in defining how missions work and becoming more specific over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Mission Washing"**: It's crucial to avoid simply redefining current policies as missions without genuine change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   **[[governance_structures_and_policy_coordination_in_missions | Governance Redesign]]**: Missions require redesigning governance, including cross-policy and cross-ministerial approaches, as problems often span traditional governmental structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

#### Case Study Examples

*   **Vinnova, Sweden (Innovation Agency)**: Engaged citizens through workshops to define missions around healthy and sustainable food and sustainable mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. The focus was on changing visible experiences (e.g., sustainable school lunches, livable streets) rather than abstract targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. This approach fostered broad engagement, from school children to the prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
*   **Health Holland, Netherlands**: Set a mission for all Dutch citizens to live at least five years longer in good health by 2040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. This required a participatory experimental process across different domains and regional contexts, acknowledging that a mission is an ongoing effort that requires reframing actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.
*   **Royal Academy of Engineering, UK**: Emphasized not overcommitting upfront, but rather exploring possibilities and understanding existing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. Success depends on a concrete goal with a flexible and dynamic approach, including being extremely inclusive of diverse communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. A key danger is the "lock-in effect," where engagement is limited to core teams, missing out on crucial action points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.

#### Differing Perspectives and Coordination

Missions are perceived differently by various actors within the innovation chain and across governance levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. A clear and understandable mission statement is essential, but it must be recognized that different people will interpret their roles differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. Effective coordination requires understanding the motivations of diverse partners, as ministries often focus on policy changes, while agencies are on the implementation side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. Missions are seen as evolving policies that develop through implementation <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.

Governments must embrace new ways of gathering and understanding information, moving beyond traditional metrics to capture the broader [[impact_and_scaling_of_mission_oriented_policies | impact of government activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. This requires developing new methodologies for analysis and deeper engagement with citizens, moving past reliance on electoral cycles or large-scale organized interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

#### Missions vs. Existing Policies

Traditional government policies often focus on short-term, siloed goals driven by political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>. Missions, however, offer a reframing tool to address complex, cross-cutting problems like [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | climate change]] with a long-term roadmap, often extending to 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>. They enable the creation of new types of government structures that are more attuned to 21st-century challenges and societal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.

Missions can be set at a policy-specific area or as an overall policy strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. National governments often initiate "mega missions" like [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | climate change]], which then need to be contextualized and operationalized at regional or city levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. Missions can stem from government action plans, but also from social movements, as public opinion can compel politicians to address certain topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.

#### Role of Civil Society and Stakeholder Commitment

[[public_sector_adoption_of_mission_oriented_approaches | Civil society organizations]] are crucial for driving [[mission_oriented_innovation_challenges_and_implementation | Mission oriented Innovation]] due to the long-term commitment missions require, which extends beyond political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Engaging society from the outset fosters stronger buy-in, as seen in countries with robust civil society actors like Sweden and Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>. Without widespread public awareness and support, ambitious policy goals may fail to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

Cities often experience missions directly, such as changes in public space or services, making their involvement vital in framing and implementing missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. Even if policy levers are outside a city's direct control, building networks and lobbying partners with those levers is essential for mission success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.

#### Designing Ambitious and Realistic Missions

The challenge lies in designing missions that are both brave and ambitious, yet achievable and realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This depends on analytical and engagement tools, as well as the diversity of perspectives brought to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. A good mission is often cross-sectoral, uncomfortable for many initially, and may highlight a lack of existing tools, indicating its ambitious nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

While high ambition is desired, it must be paired with realistic implementation plans, acknowledging existing capabilities and capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>. Missions require a continuous, evolving approach with dedicated capacity and capability building programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.

#### Overcoming Internal Resistance

Internal resistance in public organizations often stems from rational reasons, such as feedback systems that punish ambitious goals or lack of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>. To overcome this, strategies include:
*   **Demonstrating Success**: Showcasing examples of missions that have worked and led to better outcomes or improved organizational reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>.
*   **Introducing New Tools**: Integrating tools from strategic design or other fields that push beyond normal activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **Opening Up Bureaucracy**: Bringing in civil society and external partners to generate dynamism and a need for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>.
*   **Building Support Structures**: Creating systems that allow for experimentation, design, trial, and error, accepting that failure can be a learning opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>.
*   **Capacity Building**: Acknowledging that missions may force new ways of working, leading to staff turnover. Therefore, continuous capacity building and planning for new types of capabilities are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>.

[[Public administration reform | Government innovation]] often takes the form of enhancement-oriented innovation, a common practice within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Enhancement-Oriented Innovation

This type of innovation focuses on [[upgrading_existing_systems | upgrading what already exists]] and enhancing current practices and systems that governments already have in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The objective is to make systems better, faster, and quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Application to Taxation Systems

A key example of enhancement-oriented innovation is improving [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | taxation systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Governments might utilize behavioural insights to encourage faster tax payments or to prompt more informed responses to inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This approach does not involve transforming entire systems, but rather optimizing existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Risk and Implementation

One characteristic of enhancement-oriented innovation is its relatively low risk profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These improvements are implemented within current structures, allowing for the calculation and management of associated risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The goal is either to direct innovation towards making a specific system better or to leverage existing ideas to enhance what is currently in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

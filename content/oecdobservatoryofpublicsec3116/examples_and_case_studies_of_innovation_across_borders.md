In a world experiencing continuous change and complex issues, governments are increasingly looking beyond their national boundaries to develop solutions for global challenges. This has led to a growing focus on [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border government innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While there are many existing examples of this collaboration, such as efforts to end pandemics or address migration, the best methods for achieving cross-border collaboration are not yet entirely clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The fundamental question is how governments can improve their ability to innovate together for the public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has significantly changed global life, accelerating digital transformation and the pace and scale of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It also highlighted existing vulnerabilities at the national level, showcasing a lack of preparedness among governments to tackle global issues like climate change or disruptions in global value chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Public sector innovation has emerged as a key tool for collectively addressing pressing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Collaborative Research and Reports

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation have partnered to determine how innovative practices can best support [[international_collaboration_on_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Their collaboration involves extensive research, a global call for innovation to collect insights and practices, and open global workshops on [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The first report in this series, "Achieving Cross-Border Government Innovation," launched previously, emphasized that complex and transnational issues require existing international cooperation mechanisms to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It showcased how governments are leveraging new governance structures, including innovative governance bodies, horizontal networks, and coordinated systems approaches, to tackle issues spanning borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

A second report, "Surfacing Insights and Experimenting Across Borders," focuses on how experimentation has become a key mode of [[government_innovation_and_adaptation | innovation in government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This report highlights that the success of experimentation within countries has led governments to apply similar approaches in cross-border and global contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Key Examples and Case Studies

The following examples and case studies illustrate how governments are innovating across borders:

### Deep Space Food Challenge
An [[international_collaboration_on_innovation | international collaboration]] between the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and NASA, this challenge incentivizes innovation in food production technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Its goal is to meet the needs of space exploration while also addressing terrestrial issues like reducing food insecurity on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This initiative builds a "vertical ecosystem" focused on a specific mission, bringing together a coalition of people working on food challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. Despite legal and policy restrictions on financial awards, NASA and CSA run parallel prize competitions, co-marketing and synchronizing activities to achieve mutual goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.

### Global Innovation Collaborative
This network and platform facilitates collaborations among city governments worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Cities like Paris, London, New York, and Berlin launch open innovation competitions and invite innovators to deploy solutions in local testbeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This has led to more resilient and sustainable cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. During the COVID-19 crisis, the "Creative Cities Challenge" focused on the creative and cultural sector, seeking technological and digital platform solutions to help the sector recover from lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>. The open call process not only identifies winners but also exposes the public sector to the "art of the possible," showcasing technology's potential for future applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.

### 5G Corridors (5G MOBIX)

### UAE Government Accelerators Program
The UAE government has set ambitious goals for 2071, aiming to be the world's leading economy, in education, in society happiness, and in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. A key part of this vision is increasing the rate of collaboration across entities and agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. The Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation was established to cultivate an [[innovation_models_and_methods_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] culture within the government sector, aiming to make innovation a key pillar of the UAE government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

The Government Accelerators program is a tool that takes innovative ideas from ideation to accelerated implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>. It uses a "100 days or less" cap for implementation, piloting solutions by empowering frontline employees and focusing on stakeholder collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. Towards the end of the 100-day journey, the focus shifts to setting up a sustainability team and scaling the proven innovative solution to different areas or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

#### Moonshot Apprenticeship Program
Launched by the UAE government in June 2021, this program unites young minds, talents, and governments to tackle pressing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. It paired UAE nationals with international counterparts to develop "moonshot projects" in priority sectors such as data economy, global talent, and global outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>.

#### Moonshot Pilot Grant
An outcome of the Moonshot program, this grant is a call for the international community to test groundbreaking ideas in partnership with the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>. Funds of up to $100,000 per project are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>.

### Agile Nations Network
The UAE joined six other nations in the Agile Nations Network to foster global cooperation on rulemaking in response to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:48">[02:00:48]</a>.

### International Space Apps Challenge
Launched by NASA 10 years ago, this is a horizontally focused ecosystem-building activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. It puts out NASA's data, software, and tools for global innovators to build upon and solve challenges at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. In 2021, 28,000 people from 162 countries participated in the 48-hour hackathon, tackling 28 challenges and producing nearly 3,000 projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>.

### London Office of Technology and Innovation (LOTI)
Set up by London's Chief Digital Officer, LOTI aims to transform collaboration within London by bringing together the city's 32 boroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. It provides a foundation for fruitful engagement using design thinking and data expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. LOTI currently has 20-30 projects ranging from understanding electric vehicle charging infrastructure to using IoT in social care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.

### Cities Coalition for Digital Rights
This initiative, involving European cities under the GDPR framework, explores the ethical foundations for responsible innovation using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.

### Social Impact Challenges (US Examples)
*   **Georgetown University's emissions challenge**: This initiative focused on medium-sized cities, aiming to identify methods for reducing emissions to near-zero levels. It used a tournament-style model to identify regional leaders and winners, allowing for customized approaches given the local nature of climate change solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:14">[01:22:14]</a>.
*   **Aspen Institute's community college excellence prize**: This prize aimed to understand what makes a community college high-performing based on educational metrics, generating evidence and understanding in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:03">[01:24:03]</a>.

## Enabling Factors and Approaches
[[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | Innovation challenges and strategies]] in a cross-border context often involve addressing several key factors:

### Experimentation and Collective Intelligence
Experimentation is gradually becoming more common in government, turning ideas into realistic solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This includes testing and implementing solutions while keeping risks manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The power of "ground-up" innovation and collective intelligence is crucial, as the most creative ideas often originate from outside an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. Harnessing knowledge from anywhere through open innovation platforms, crowdsourcing, and democratic citizen assemblies can mobilize brain power more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.

### Building Ecosystems
Understanding and engaging diverse stakeholders within ecosystems is critical for scaling innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:08">[02:58:08]</a>. Ecosystems can be approached horizontally (e.g., communities of practice around specific methods like prize competitions or citizen science) or vertically (e.g., mission-focused coalitions like those addressing climate change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>. Key elements for creating sustainable innovation ecosystems include:
*   **Legal and Policy Frameworks**: These should not be static; they can be changed through legislative proposals to enable new approaches (e.g., laws for prizes and citizen science in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.
*   **Shared Infrastructure and Common Platforms**: Platforms like Challenge.gov or Data.gov provide a low-cost starting point for innovators and a single point of access for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>.
*   **Communities of Practice**: Connecting people who want to learn at various stages of the process and supporting these communities is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.
*   **Budgeting**: Budgeting for success, not just piloting, ensures that projects can be scaled after a successful experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
*   **Addressing Agency Processes**: Streamlining internal processes that create barriers is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.
*   **Reporting Requirements**: Keeping teams honest about results and encouraging quantitative and qualitative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **External Assessments and Impact Studies**: Adopting an evaluation mindset helps identify impacts and learn for future improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.

### Addressing Cultural Barriers
[[challenges_and_success_factors_in_crossborder_collaboration | Cultural norms]] and a lack of feedback mechanisms are significant barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:28">[02:57:28]</a>. Creating a culture of openness and [[government_innovation and_adaptation | innovation]] is a key success factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:01">[02:58:01]</a>. In London, collaboration was fostered by identifying authorities that ascribed to a certain set of principles, effectively embedding an agile methodology in municipal government and creating a "cool to join" movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>.

### Institutionalizing Innovation
Many innovation efforts remain ad-hoc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. For long-term impact, [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border innovation]] needs to be institutionalized, becoming part of established roles and budgets, similar to scientific research collaborations like GAVI for vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. This ensures that new evidence is systematically gathered, documented, and shared, avoiding the waste of collective intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Many of the largest challenges facing the world today are inherently cross-border, making [[international_collaboration_on_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] increasingly necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:11">[02:25:11]</a>. Even when procedural or cultural issues make collaboration difficult, the global nature of problems like climate change, food security, and water scarcity necessitates finding ways to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:17">[02:25:17]</a>. This will likely involve more "mini-lateralism" – flexible groupings of countries, cities, or organizations working on specific tasks, rather than relying solely on traditional multilateral bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. The future will involve more structured experiments, rigorous measurement, quick learning, and continuous sharing of insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>.

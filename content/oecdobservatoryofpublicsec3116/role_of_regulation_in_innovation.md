Innovation is defined as something novel or new to a specific context that is implemented and has an impact or shifts public value [00:07:22]. It is not merely an idea, but an action that ultimately aims to improve public outcomes and serve the public [00:07:28]. While innovation can sometimes lead to failure, learning from both successes and failures is crucial for leveraging effective approaches in the future [00:07:57].

## Why Governments Must Innovate

Governments need to constantly ask themselves if they are ready for the future [00:05:00]. Complex challenges, such as the climate crisis, necessitate leveraging innovation and proactive, multi-sectoral, multi-stakeholder approaches [00:06:17]. Governments cannot succeed by always reacting to problems [00:06:27].

Innovation is essential for several reasons:
*   **Keeping Pace with Change** Governments tend to be path-dependent and slow-moving, but innovation enables proactive engagement with new technologies, opportunities, and the changing context of uncertainty and volatility [00:09:01].
*   **Building Trust** Innovation helps design and deliver services that meet citizen needs, fostering trust between governments and citizens [00:09:36].
*   **Exploring Uncertainty** Innovation provides a resource to explore uncertainty, engage with possible futures, and steer towards preferred outcomes [00:10:18].
*   **Improving Public Outcomes** Ultimately, innovation aims to improve public value and the lives of citizens [00:10:37].

> "If we talk about climate change by far the biggest challenge is innovation. If we only deal with the consequences we will never solve the problem." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> — Prime Minister Janez Janša

Despite the clear need, a survey during the COVID-19 recovery phase found that the number one challenge for delivering better public services was a "lack of vision and leadership to move on from old ways" [00:11:04]. Additionally, 52.3% of public managers were willing to acknowledge lessons learned but not as willing to change behaviors or take action, highlighting an opportunity area for providing tools and resources [00:12:40].

## Types of Innovation and Regulatory Implications

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) identifies different types of innovation activities that can be supported systemically in government [00:13:56]:

*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation** Characterized by "quick wins" and doing things better, these are often incremental improvements [00:14:45]. An example is Estonia's proactive family benefit system, where the government automatically offers services to new parents based on birth registration, reducing citizen burden [00:15:25]. Such innovations often involve streamlining existing regulations or digitalizing procedures [00:15:01].

*   **[[adaptive_innovation_examples_in_regulatory_systems | Adaptive Innovation]]** This involves adapting services and policies to constantly changing circumstances, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., forced telework or adapting communication strategies) [00:16:11]. Japan's agile governance model is an example of a governmental approach that continually understands changing conditions and risks, sets new goals, develops, implements, and evaluates new systems. This non-linear process ensures policies and service delivery approaches remain relevant to demographic shifts, media consumption, and other societal changes [00:16:42]. This model implies a regulatory environment flexible enough to accommodate continuous adaptation.

*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation** This approach addresses difficult, complex targets like climate change by involving a wide range of stakeholders to collectively define problems, develop solutions, and implement them [00:18:22]. The European Commission defines mission areas around climate neutrality, healthy oceans, and cancer [00:18:36]. This requires creating comprehensive coordination and collaborative mechanisms, collective long-term visions, institutional infrastructure, and, crucially, developing supportive funding, procurement, and [[innovation_friendly_regulation_rationale | regulatory environments]] [00:19:29].

*   **Anticipatory Innovation** This emerging field engages with uncertainty and the future by creating evidence about potential futures in the present to inform decision-making [00:20:12]. This involves using strategic foresight to explore potential scenarios and understand their implications for the public sector, allowing for current policy decisions that prepare for these futures [00:20:26]. For instance, a report with the Slovenian government imagined four different future worlds to assess implications for public sector aging and talent management [00:21:05]. This approach highlights the need for regulatory foresight to prevent future obstacles.

## Barriers to Innovation and the Role of Regulation

Common barriers to innovation include [00:41:52]:
*   Challenging the status quo and resistance to change [00:42:27]
*   Strict hierarchies and decision-making [00:41:57]
*   [[risk_management_in_innovation | Risk avoidance behavior]] [00:42:01]
*   Lack of vision, leadership, and strategic frameworks [00:42:17]
*   Funding issues and divergence between government levels [00:42:23]
*   The "magnetism of business as usual" and fear of change [00:42:27]
*   Corruption and bureaucracy [00:42:40]
*   Lack of knowledge, skills, and tools [00:48:42]
*   Fear of losing control or undesired results [00:50:23]

### Regulation as a Barrier
A significant barrier is the regulatory environment itself, particularly procurement rules, which can block experimentation [00:53:30]. Civil servants often feel constrained by internal rules when attempting innovative projects [00:53:49]. This often leads to a mindset barrier where individuals perceive regulations as more restrictive than they actually are, or imagine barriers where none exist [01:00:33].

### Regulation as an Enabler: [[innovation_friendly_regulation_rationale | Innovation-Friendly Regulation]]

**Slovenia's Approach**
Slovenia's `innovative.si` project focuses on strengthening an innovation culture within public administration by creatively resolving complex social challenges and building employee competencies for new ways of working [00:37:46]. They recognize that an effective legal framework is crucial for encouraging innovation and experimentation [00:59:14]. They work closely with units focused on "better regulation" and the "stop the bureaucracy" program to foster this environment [00:59:21]. By selecting ideas from various public administration bodies and developing them into prototypes with active user involvement, they aim to change mindsets and prove that cooperation between public administration and the economy works [00:38:47].

**Denmark's "Free Municipality Experiments"**
Denmark has implemented "free municipality experiments" (FME) for several iterations, where municipalities can apply for exemptions from national regulations that hinder their desired initiatives [01:17:23]. If parliament approves, these municipalities can conduct experiments, and if successful, the exemption can be extended to all municipalities [01:18:00]. This creates a structural framework for experimentation and has a "massive cultural impact" by legitimizing and increasing the "room for experimentation" [01:17:17]. Even if a solution developed under an FME didn't strictly require the regulatory exemption, the mandate and public expectation created by the FME encouraged the innovation [01:19:50]. This demonstrates how explicitly adapting regulations can foster a proactive, experimental mindset within the public sector [01:21:10]. The latest version of FMEs grants specific areas (e.g., schools, elderly care) to designated municipalities, removing regulatory hurdles at both national and municipal levels to encourage innovation [01:20:15].

## Fostering Innovation: Key Principles and Strategies

To overcome barriers and systematically support innovation beyond individual efforts, several strategies are important:
*   **Building Infrastructure Takes Time** An innovation agenda requires consistent, long-term work. Governments should work towards what they want to happen and play the "long game," understanding that different approaches (bottom-up, top-down) will be needed over time [00:30:40].
*   **Political Leadership Matters** Politicians are accountable for public sector productivity and services, making their inclusion and support for innovation agendas crucial [00:31:23]. Initiatives should focus on strengthening collaboration between civil servants and politicians [00:31:39].
*   **Visible and Legitimate Innovation Labs** Having a visible innovation lab with high legitimacy and a relevant core business area (e.g., MindLab in Denmark) can help strengthen the innovation agenda by showing that "innovation isn't some fun game we play in the corners" [00:32:37].
*   **Collaborating Across Silos** Digitalization efforts, as seen in Denmark, teach the importance of cross-silo collaboration, which is essential for tackling complex "wicked problems" like climate change and demographic challenges [00:33:30].
*   **Decentralized Autonomy** Bureaucracy can aid innovation by offering "decentral autonomy" within the system. This allows for innovation and improvement on things that don't require massive funding or major political decisions, providing good starting points [00:34:25].
*   **Innovation as a Means, Not an End** Innovation should be seen as a tool to achieve goals like efficiency and higher quality services, rather than a goal in itself [00:35:33]. The focus should be on improving public outcomes and citizens' lives [00:36:48].
*   **Training and Knowledge** Providing innovation training programs for public administration employees is crucial to changing perspectives on workflow, problem-solving, and design through effective communication [00:39:22].
*   **Community and Networking** Building a strong innovation community and network of "innovation ambassadors" (individuals actively promoting innovation) fosters collaboration, learning, and sharing of good practices, empowering individuals and driving change [00:39:43]. This creates a "coalition of the willing" with an open mindset [00:54:46].
*   **Experimental Space and Learning from Mistakes** Establishing a safe experimental space is vital for introducing new mechanisms and fostering multi-level cooperation, where mistakes are allowed and serve as learning opportunities [00:48:06].
*   **Focus on Problem-Solving** Instead of quickly seeking solutions, focus on understanding and well-designing the problem first [00:49:05]. A "problem-oriented approach" resonates well with politicians and senior managers, linking innovation to tangible issues and their consequences [01:06:40].
*   **Strategic Communication** Tell stories about the results and impact of innovation early on, rather than just focusing on the process, to gain long-term buy-in from management [01:11:19].
*   **Start by Starting** Don't wait for the entire system to be ready. Find windows of opportunity, engage those with an open mindset, and start where it's possible and where it matters most – at the core business [01:24:25]. Innovation should be integral ("rye bread") to daily operations, not just an add-on ("whipped cream") [01:25:11].
*   **Leverage Opportunity Moments** Global events like the COVID-19 pandemic can create "opportunity moments" for carrying the innovation agenda forward, especially when funding is available and there's energy from visible governmental innovation [01:27:32].

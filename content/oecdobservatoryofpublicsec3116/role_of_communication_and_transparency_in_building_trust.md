The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the critical importance of public [[Trust and Transparency in Public Policy | trust]] for the effectiveness of public policies, ranging from compliance with restrictions to vaccine uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Public services themselves were adapted during this crisis, often utilizing digital technologies to ensure [[citizen engagement and trust in uncertain times | citizen engagement]] and meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The OECD's work indicates that [[Building trust in public institutions | trust in institutions]] is primarily driven by the responsiveness and reliability of services, as well as perceptions of their fairness, openness, and integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Key Learnings on Trust from the Pandemic

### Trust Matters
Both governmental and interpersonal trust are crucial. Governments that started the pandemic with higher [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust]] levels also saw higher adoption of health behaviors and pro-social actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This highlights the ongoing need to focus on [[Building trust in public institutions | building trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Communication is Crucial
When governments communicate promptly and clearly about necessary actions, even if the news is difficult, [[Citizen trust and public communication | citizens]] tend to follow guidelines, and the perception of government performance increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Telling "difficult truths" can be more effective than downplaying issues, as seen in examples like Denmark compared to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. Simplicity in communication also aids public understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

### The Importance of the Local Level
Focusing on the local level, including the role of local leaders and community-based policies, has proven effective in increasing [[Trust and Transparency in Public Policy | trust]] and adherence to measures, such as vaccination efforts in Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. The local level is fundamental for [[Building trust in public institutions | building trust]] because it's where people who might be excluded nationally often participate the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Challenges to Trust and Effective Communication

The COVID-19 crisis has, in some contexts, increased the distance between [[Citizen trust and public communication | citizens]] and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Key challenges include:

*   **Misinformation and Polarization:** The rapid spread of misinformation, especially through social media, creates societal divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. This makes it difficult for governments to differentiate facts from fake stories and maintain a coherent public narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
*   **"Reality Show" Transparency:** Excessive transparency in crisis decision-making, where every comment is reacted to, can sometimes appear more like a "reality show" than a fact-based discussion, hindering proactive and strategic policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Competing Ministerial Interests:** Different government ministries often represent competing interests within society (e.g., education vs. health vs. economy), leading to internal competition and making it harder to find a common goal for public communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **Digitalization and Inequality:** While digitalization has greatly aided efficient public service delivery (e.g., rapid unemployment benefits), it can inadvertently widen gaps by not reaching vulnerable groups (e.g., indigenous people, the elderly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. Online participation often reproduces existing inequalities, with less represented groups also being less active online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.
*   **Lack of Long-Term Vision and Leadership:** A perceived lack of long-term vision and leadership, and a tendency to revert to old ways, prevent governments from fully integrating lessons from past crises like the 2008 financial crisis into building more inclusive economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>. This includes a need for greater accountability for decisions beyond an electoral cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Building Trust and Inclusivity Moving Forward

To bridge the gap between [[Citizen trust and public communication | citizens]] and governments and strengthen [[Building trust in public institutions | public trust]], several approaches are emerging:

*   **Humble Government:** Leaders and civil servants should acknowledge what they don't know, accept limitations, and publicly ask for help and input from [[Citizen trust and public communication | citizens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. This fosters flexibility and willingness to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **Co-creation and Design Thinking:** Policies should be designed *around* the people who use and serve them. This involves bringing together diverse stakeholders (e.g., doctors, nurses, managers for a salary system) to collaboratively design solutions. This participatory approach increases feelings of being heard and understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   **Empowering Public Employees:** Governments need to change internal processes to empower public employees, giving them ownership and responsibility in delivering public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.
*   **Coordination Over Silos:** Shifting from ministerial silos to greater coordination between different sectors and levels of government is essential for coherent policy development and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.
*   **Continuous Feedback Loops:** Public services should incorporate continuous feedback mechanisms, allowing [[Citizen trust and public communication | citizens]] to see how their input is being used, thereby maintaining [[Building trust in government response | trust]] in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.
*   **Diversified Participation Mechanisms:** Recognize that different [[Citizen trust and public communication | citizens]] desire different levels of engagement. Solutions should not only seek to force participation but also make people more knowledgeable about the services they use and how these are funded by their taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Community Trust:** Governments should identify and utilize existing community engagement and leadership structures instead of always creating new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
*   **New Skills for Public Servants:** Public servants require a broader skill set, including big data analysis, ethnographic interviews, user experience design, and quick survey tools, to adapt to new policy-making environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

### Innovative Tools and Experiences

*   **"1+2+4" Facilitation Method:** A simple yet effective tool for discussions: individuals think alone (1 minute), then discuss in pairs (2 minutes), and finally in larger groups (4 minutes). This ensures all participants feel their opinions are valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>.
*   **Empathy Maps:** Asking stakeholder groups to articulate what they believe others think about them. This can reveal unexpected perceptions and open crucial discussions about [[Trust and Transparency in Public Policy | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.
*   **Digital Government Systems:** Examples like Latvia's quick digital processing of unemployment benefits and online legislation design platforms demonstrate the potential for efficient and inclusive service delivery through digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
*   **[[Building trust in publicprivate partnerships | Public-Private Partnerships]] for Solutions:** Governments, such as Singapore's, engaging startups and tech companies to co-create solutions to social problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>.

Ultimately, [[Building trust in public institutions | building more inclusive public policies]] and institutions is not only a basis for better services but also empowers [[Citizen trust and public communication | citizens]], thereby strengthening [[Citizen trust and its impact on governance | public trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. This ongoing conversation is crucial for creating [[Building trust through effective public administration | better public governance]] that is both inclusive and future-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:27">[01:08:27]</a>.

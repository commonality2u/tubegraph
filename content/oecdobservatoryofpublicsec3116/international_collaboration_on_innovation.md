The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is actively engaged in fostering [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | international collaboration on governance innovation]] through initiatives like the draft declaration on public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This declaration aims to bring countries together to establish common agreements and frameworks for innovation within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

## National Declarations Informing International Efforts

The OECD's efforts are significantly informed by the experiences of member countries that have already implemented similar national declarations or manifestos on public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Discussions with countries like France and Canada provide valuable insights into how these documents are created, how they come about in specific contexts, and how they have been used to spur innovation action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Canada's Declaration on Public Sector Innovation

Canada's Declaration on Public Sector Innovation has been in place for a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Its development began in 2015, stemming from discussions among the heads of Canada's public services regarding public service renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Canada operates under a federated model of governance, involving federal, provincial, and territorial governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The 14 heads of public services meet quarterly to discuss common issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Annual gatherings on public sector innovation led to the idea of a declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The declaration, drafted in early 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, is non-binding but serves to signal that public service leaders prioritize innovation, trying new things, and taking risks to deliver better policies and programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. It was signed in November 2017, marking the first time all heads of public services signed a document together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

The declaration is used as a "signpost" to empower agencies and personnel to explore new ideas and improve outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. It also facilitates engaging with provincial and territorial colleagues to collaboratively pilot new ideas, fostering [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border government collaboration and innovation]] and de-risking initiatives by working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### France's Manifesto for Public Sector Innovation

France released its Manifesto for Public Sector Innovation in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The manifesto emerged from a growing interest in innovation within the French administration, evidenced by the creation of new public labs in most French regions in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. There was an expectation to define public sector innovation within the French context and provide guidelines for new public servants who were discovering concepts like labs, design, and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The manifesto aimed to establish innovation as a serious, results-oriented approach to public policymaking, moving beyond a mere "fashion" or superficial events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This six-page document was officially released at an event in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

The manifesto provided a common reference text, a national guideline, and official promotion of public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. It gave public sector innovators legitimacy and a basis for their projects, helping to grow a community of vision and mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. While facing initial endorsement difficulties and ongoing hostility from some top management, it has helped drive some political support and advance the transformation of the administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

## OECD's Approach to [[International Collaboration on Governance Innovation | Public Sector Innovation]]

The OECD's draft declaration aims to unify efforts and signify that innovation is integral to governmental operations, not merely an addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This declaration is rooted in lessons learned from and with countries, including detailed work with the Public Service of Canada on its innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

### Why a Declaration?

Innovation is crucial for governments to address modern challenges, and while it has always occurred, the current rate of innovation needs to match societal needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. The declaration seeks to:
*   **Systematize Innovation:** Embed innovation as a more systemic activity across government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
*   **Build Common Language:** Unpack the multifaceted nature of innovation to create a more accessible language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   **Promote Portfolio Approach:** Encourage governments to maintain a portfolio of different innovation facets (enhancement-oriented, mission-oriented, adaptive, anticipatory) to be ready for challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
*   **Codify and Storytell:** Codify language to tell a richer story about why innovation matters and how public servants can contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.

### Key Principles

The declaration emphasizes the need to:
*   Embrace and enhance existing public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   Recognize that all public servants, not just specialists, have a role and need to be equipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
*   Foster [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation | new partnerships]] and involve diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
*   Acknowledge that innovation is an evolving practice, requiring continuous [[collaborative_learning_and_innovation_in_government | learning and sharing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

## Public Consultation Process

The OECD launched a public consultation process for the draft declaration in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>, concluding on February 22nd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. Feedback is welcomed from individuals, organizations, groups, or countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

The consultation seeks specific feedback on:
*   Clarity of directives and proposed actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.
*   Language suggestions, especially regarding terminology that might have different meanings across cultural contexts (e.g., "weak signals," "civil servant" vs. "public servant") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   Feasibility of proposed actions and their potential implications in specific country contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. For example, learning from failure in experimentation needs to be framed within the context of distinct, auditable activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.

The OECD particularly encourages feedback from local governments and local innovation ecosystems, as innovation must be considered from an ecosystem perspective, involving all levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

### Future Steps and Implications

The declaration, once finalized, is intended to be an official OECD instrument, though not legally binding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. Member countries can affirm their commitment to its ideals, using it to signal the importance of innovation and to inform their innovation strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. It serves as a guide for governments to build and maintain a diverse innovation portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

[[Cocreation and international collaboration | Citizen participation]] is considered a crucial part of effective public sector innovation, relying on understanding diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. The declaration incorporates this by encouraging governments to seek and listen to different voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

The OECD is also actively researching the leadership mindsets and skills required to develop innovation competency and capability within organizations, and the specific skills needed at different stages of the innovation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. This work recognizes that effective innovation requires an ecosystem of diverse players contributing at various stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal of the declaration is to foster [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | international collaboration in government innovation]] and ensure the document is a useful tool for public servants and governments worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.

Innovation ecosystems are complex systems comprising interactions between diverse actors, exhibiting emergent, non-linear, and unpredictable behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. Their resilience stems from the diversity of actors and the interactions, including the flows of information and resources between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. The objective of orchestrating these ecosystems is to achieve a balance between value extraction and value creation, and to align around a shared purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

## Understanding Innovation Ecosystems

Traditionally, innovation has often been viewed as a linear process, relying on one-way technology transfer and a clear intervention logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. However, it is increasingly recognized that innovation is facilitated by the interweaving of relationships among a diverse set of actors with varied interests and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

### The Biophony Analogy

The concept of biophony, coined by Bernie Krause, offers a unique lens through which to understand [[innovation ecosystems and portfolio management | innovation ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Krause's extensive recordings of the natural world revealed that what might seem like a cacophony of animal voices is, in fact, a highly orchestrated acoustic arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Each creature occupies a niche, responding to others to be heard, as seen with crickets chirping at high pitches and elephants making low, bassy sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. This simultaneous, rich interweaving of sound allows animals to cooperate and respond to threats, essential for their survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

Biophony also serves as an indicator of ecosystem health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. For instance, selective logging in California's Sierra Nevada mountains dramatically altered the rich biophony, demonstrating how an ecosystem, though appearing structurally similar, can lose its thriving density and diversity due to disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Similarly, in [[innovation ecosystems and portfolio management | innovation ecosystems]], apparent structure might not guarantee activity, and a cacophony of uncoordinated voices may need to be orchestrated to foster creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

### Characteristics of Ecosystems

Key findings regarding ecosystems include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>:
*   **Complexity**: They are complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.
*   **Interactions**: Composed of interactions between heterogeneous actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.
*   **Emergent Behavior**: Display emergent behavior not observable by analyzing individual actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.
*   **Non-linear and Unpredictable Responses**: Their responses are non-linear and unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
*   **Resilience**: Their resilience derives from the diversity of actors and their interactions, and the flows of information and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

Focusing solely on innovation metrics or economic growth can bias orchestrators away from understanding how ecosystems truly function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

## Orchestrating Innovation Ecosystems

The process of orchestration involves enabling stakeholders to hear each other and their environment, identifying threats and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. It supports them in recognizing complementarities, leveraging each other's capabilities, adapting their activities, and developing coordinated, creative relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

### Key Skills and Approaches for Orchestration

Balancing diverse interests and fostering cooperation among stakeholders requires specific skills and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>:

1.  **Enthusiasm of the Orchestrating Team**: The team building the ecosystems needs enthusiasm and willingness to try this approach, especially given initial skepticism from industry partners who prioritize immediate projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.
2.  **Emphasis on Practicality and Realistic Gains**: Orchestrators must emphasize practical aspects and identify realistic gains for all stakeholders involved, avoiding overly abstract concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
3.  **Simplicity in Communication**: The ability to design and explain complex ideas simply is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>.
4.  **Setting Joint Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Establishing shared KPIs and clearly showing both individual and community gains encourages collaboration, demonstrating that "together they can achieve more than individually" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.
5.  **Assessing Stakeholder Maturity Levels**: It is critical to assess the maturity levels of stakeholders, as their aims vary depending on their life cycle stage (e.g., a struggling startup versus an established, well-funded company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
6.  **Understanding Groundwork and Preconditions**: A thorough understanding of the local and international context, including the overall conditions and the specific focus area, is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.
7.  **Convening Key Decision-Makers**: The ability to bring together key decision-makers and "shakers and movers" is vital for building the agenda forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>.
8.  **Inspiring Wider Networks and Communication**: To achieve broader societal impact, orchestrators need strong capabilities in inspiring wider networks and communicating widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>.
9.  **Continuous Evolution and Revision**: Regular evaluation and adaptation are important for the ecosystem's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.
10. **Starting with Relationships**: While defining a shared purpose is crucial, creating new, often more equal relationships among stakeholders is a prerequisite for reaching new purposes and shifting power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>.
11. **Neutral Orchestration**: A neutral orchestrator or organization is often beneficial, as it can combine different viewpoints without a biased agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51:00">[26:51:00]</a>.
12. **Maintaining Trust through Delivery**: Coordinators bear a significant responsibility to deliver on their promises to stakeholders. Losing this trust, especially by failing to show tangible results after initial engagement, can cause stakeholders to disengage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>.

### Accelerating System Change

[[systems_thinking_in_innovation | Systems innovation]] aims to develop entirely new systems (e.g., for care, health, education, energy, mobility, housing) rather than just products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. This often involves new entrepreneurial forces (disruptive ideas), incumbents trying to renew or defend themselves, and competition or complementarity between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. Innovation often occurs in a "washing machine" like dynamic, a vortex where relationships are formed and new ideas and systems emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a>. Various roles, including investors, "exiters" (those leaving old activities), consumer innovators, social activists, evaluators, and policymakers, are essential for enabling this change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>.

Historically, [[systems_thinking_in_innovation | systems change]] can be a meandering process, taking 30-40 years for transitions as new technologies, systems, and purposes evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>. The challenge is how to accelerate this process when facing urgent social challenges, especially when the "moon" or clear destination is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>.

Instead of a narrow funnel approach, a model that amplifies and expands outwards is needed to facilitate "intentional emergence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. This involves deliberately synchronizing, complementing, and coordinating multiple commitments from diverse stakeholders to create a dynamic for accelerated systems change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>.

Successful ecosystem initiatives often focus on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>:
*   Balancing flows of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.
*   Aligning incentives towards a shared purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   Encouraging autopoiesis (self-regeneration), which requires creative forces ("adequate underground") and an open middle ground to connect these forces with existing institutions and actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.
*   Recognizing that context is everything, and different interventions are required for ecosystems at various stages of their life cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) is actively working to test and develop approaches for the creation of [[innovation ecosystems and portfolio management | anticipatory innovation ecosystems]], incorporating novel approaches for [[systems_thinking_in_innovation | futures thinking]] to make them more future-oriented in their goals and activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

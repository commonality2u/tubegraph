The Forum on Government After Shock brought together global discussions on rethinking and rebuilding through innovation, providing an opportunity for reflection on successful strategies, shortcomings, and future needs in government responses to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A key focus of the discussion was the implications of the [[challenges_faced_by_governments_in_the_covid19_crisis | COVID-19 crisis]] for government and its future beyond the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Key Roles of National and Federal Governments

A poll conducted during the session explored the most effective roles played by national and federal governments in crisis response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The options presented were:
*   Deploying a unified response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   Enabling other actors, including the subnational level, to play a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Countering negative economic impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   Providing direct support to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>

Poll results showed that countering negative economic impact and directly supporting citizens were perceived as the most influential roles (30% each), while deploying a unified response and enabling other actors each received 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Minister Nikolai Astrup of Norway noted this outcome as natural, given the crisis's impact on people's jobs and lives, emphasizing that security for individuals and families is foremost in people's minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.

## Norway's Approach to Crisis Management

Minister Astrup shared Norway's experiences and insights into managing the COVID-19 emergency. He highlighted several critical components of their response:

### Building Trust and [[effective_communication_and_citizen_trust_in_crisis | Effective Communication]]
Norway, as a society with high existing trust, leveraged this to ensure public willingness to adhere to government advice and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Key communication strategies included:
*   Frequent press conferences from the central government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   Special press conferences directed at children, with the Prime Minister and other ministers answering questions digitally to ensure all parts of the population understood the measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   "People's question time" on platforms like Facebook, allowing the public to engage directly with ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Transparency about the rationale behind measures, including acknowledging uncertainties, to foster trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Close contact with health authorities and basing decisions on scientific advice, while being transparent when other considerations (like economic impact) lead to different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Targeted Outreach to Vulnerable Groups
The government recognized the [[citizen_centered_governance_and_its_challenges_during_cris | challenges faced by governments in the Covid19 crisis]] in reaching all segments of the population. Efforts were made to provide information to immigrant communities who might not follow mainstream Norwegian news, often by working closely with religious leaders to convey necessary guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. A specific focus was placed on safeguarding vulnerable children, ensuring that those already struggling before the crisis did not suffer further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Municipalities received financial support and guidance to deliver targeted support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### [[crossagency_collaboration_in_crisis_management | Cross-Agency Collaboration]] and Decentralized Adaptation
Coordination was seen as key in the national response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This involved:
*   Regular meetings with County Governors and municipalities from across the country, often including multiple ministers to ensure coordination across affected sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   A unified national approach with guidelines and advice, combined with empowering local governments to adapt measures to local circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This flexibility is crucial because local situations, such as outbreak severity, vary significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Overly harsh or insufficient local restrictions can erode public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   Closer contact with directorates across different areas, recognizing that crisis challenges, like COVID-19, affect many sectors and require coordinated government efforts beyond traditional silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### [[innovative_government_responses_to_the_crisis | Innovation]] and Digital Transformation
The crisis has accelerated existing trends and thrust new [[innovative_government_responses_to_the_crisis | innovations]] upon the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Examples include:
*   A surge in online health consultations, a practice the government had long aspired to implement but only saw widespread adoption during COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   Rapid identification and amendment of legal barriers to digitalization, such as laws requiring physical meetings or signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This highlights the need for technology-neutral and AI-ready legal frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

The Minister emphasized that successful change in society hinges on three factors:
*   **Culture:** Fostering a culture of thinking outside the box, challenging existing methods, and allowing for some degree of failure to promote innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **[[leadership_and_teamwork_in_crisis_management | Leadership]]:** Leaders who inspire this culture of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
*   **Competence:** Ensuring the necessary skills are available, particularly in smaller municipalities, necessitating close cooperation between municipal and national levels to advance innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

A new white paper on public sector [[innovative_government_responses_to_the_crisis | innovation]] and a strategy for digitalization, developed jointly with municipal organizations, aim to ensure seamless services across governmental levels, prioritizing citizen convenience over administrative divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook and Lessons Learned

The COVID-19 crisis is viewed as a marathon, requiring sustained readiness and adaptation from government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Important lessons learned include:
*   **Benefit from Crisis:** The crisis has demonstrated the possibility of doing things differently under pressure, fostering a spirit of [[innovative_government_responses_to_the_crisis | innovation]] that should be safeguarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Breaking Down Silos:** The traditional silos within government have disappeared or become less prominent due to the immediate need for [[crossagency_collaboration_in_crisis_management | coordination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Trust:** Norway's secret to maintaining trust lies in being a very open society with accessible politicians who actively engage with citizens, reinforcing trust in institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.

The crisis has also accelerated existing trends like digital transformation, such as the increased use of online health consultations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Future Challenges
The Minister emphasized that the SDGs must be incorporated into all government efforts, not treated as an add-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. Even during the crisis, the focus on inequalities, good education, and health services for vulnerable children aligns with SDG principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. Crisis measures should encourage sustainable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis is seen as the beginning of a larger transformation, highlighting the need to constantly re-evaluate legal frameworks to ensure they do not hinder [[innovative_government_responses_to_the_crisis | innovation]] and digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. The lessons learned are crucial for addressing other major societal challenges, such as the [[role_of_government_in_environmental_threats | climate challenge]] and growing global inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Overcoming these requires continued cooperation, trust-building, and a shared understanding that "we are all in the same boat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.

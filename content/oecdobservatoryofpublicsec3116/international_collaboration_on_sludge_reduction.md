Sludge refers to unnecessary frictions in processes that block access, impose psychological costs, and erode trust when engaging with public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. While the term is relatively new, the burden it describes is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Sludge in government is often unintentional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, with common examples including hard-to-find information, difficult-to-understand or complete processes, long waiting times without updates, and complex decision points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

This document explores how [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | international collaboration]] is driving efforts to identify and reduce sludge in public services worldwide.

## The OECD's Role in [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | Sludge Reduction]]

The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) Behavioral Science team leads efforts in [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | international collaboration]] on [[international_collaboration_in_behavioral_policy | behavioral policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This work stems from the OECD Network for Behavioral Insights Experts in Government, which has become a center for knowledge exchange and [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | international collaboration]] with over 100 government officials from more than 50 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. A key priority for the OECD since 2021 has been building trust in public institutions, placing it at the center of its reinforcing democracy initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Improving the quality of public services is crucial, as people's experiences with government services directly influence their perception of governments and public satisfaction drives trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

An OECD survey on trust in public institutions in 2021 revealed that interactions with public services profoundly shape perceptions of government responsiveness and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Less than four in ten respondents believed complaining about a poorly performing service would lead to improvement, reaffirming the need to focus on daily citizen-institution interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Understanding Psychological Costs

A significant contribution of the "sludge" concept is its emphasis on psychological costs, which are challenging to quantify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The paper "Fixing Frictions" attempts to better define these costs, categorizing them as:
*   **Search costs**: Occur when people search for hard-to-find information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Decision costs**: Experienced when evaluating options, especially when they are similar, leading to psychological overload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Cognitive costs**: Mental resources expended in fulfilling requirements or understanding complex information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This refers to the "brain capital" used to overcome unclear information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   **Emotional costs**: Include current and country stigma, loss of autonomy, and feelings of stress, disempowerment, anxiety, or frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

These psychological costs disproportionately impact vulnerable people, not just vulnerable groups, but individuals at any time of their life when they are most susceptible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## The New South Wales [[tools_and_methodologies_for_sludge_audits | Sludge Audit Method]]

The New South Wales (NSW) Sludge Audit Method, developed by their Behavioral Insights Unit, has been in use for four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Inspired by Professor Cass Sunstein's work, it aims to incorporate a behavioral science perspective into service improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This method seeks to address gaps in previous approaches by:
*   Systematically applying behavioral science evidence to service improvement in an accessible format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   Quantifying different aspects of sludge, particularly psychological costs and equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.
*   Providing a data-driven way to prioritize fixes and measure impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

The NSW method uses seven steps and focuses on four key metrics: time, cost, effort, and inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. The "effort" and "inclusion" components, codifying behavioral science evidence, are considered most unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. A "sludge audit toolkit" including a "sludge finder web tool" supports the audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The method has been tested on nearly 100 audits with significant impact on services in NSW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

## The International Sludge Academy (ISA)

The first International Sludge Academy, a [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | collaboration]] between the OECD and NSW government, piloted the NSW methodology outside of Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

### First International Sludge Academy (ISA 1.0)
The initiative launched in Paris at an OECD network meeting, drawing interest from 22 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Sixteen teams from 14 countries were selected to conduct parallel [[sludge_audits_and_their_impact_on_government_services | sludge audits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Participants attended masterclasses on the NSW method and received one-on-one mentorship and coaching from NSW colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. Teams then reviewed results, developed, and implemented solutions, sharing learnings throughout the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

The academy revealed a global desire among governments to reduce sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Audits covered a diverse range of processes, including citizen-facing services (e.g., France, Brazil) and internal government processes (e.g., Canada, Australian federal level HR services like employee onboarding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This demonstrated the applicability of the method beyond traditional public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

### Nine Good Practice Principles
From the first ISA, nine principles were identified to support governments conducting [[sludge_audits_and_their_impact_on_government_services | sludge audits]], outlined in the "Fixing Frictions" paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>:
1.  **Deciding to do a sludge audit**: Assess control over changing the process and implementing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. A strong "line of sight" between the audit and implementation is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Sludge audits can also serve as a compelling business case for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
2.  **Having a method**: A predefined, common, and tested methodology ensures rigor, reliability, and replicability, allowing for comparisons across time and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
3.  **Tailoring the audit to context**: Accommodate complex behavioral journeys and non-linear government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Finnish teams, for example, conducted multiple audits for different customer types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. The NSW journey mapping tool was improved based on feedback to cater to non-linear journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
4.  **Deploying an equity lens**: Recognize that sludge disproportionately affects underserved communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. Audits can specifically focus on these communities, even if they represent a small percentage of overall customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.
5.  **Evaluating progress**: Ensure audits translate into tangible changes by using behavioral frameworks and re-auditing services to measure impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
6.  **System enablers**: Successful sludge prevention programs require a government committed to improving user services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Closer connections to service owners and access to systematic customer survey data are also beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

### International Sludge Academy 2.0 (Planned)
Building on the success of ISA 1.0, plans for a second academy aim to:
*   Cater to diverse team needs, offering varied activities for those who can conduct audits independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.
*   Further develop the [[tools_and_methodologies_for_sludge_audits | sludge audit method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   Open participation to a broader set of teams beyond just behavioral science, including program, policy, and service delivery teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.

ISA 2.0 will emphasize peer learning due to the growing community of teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. The OECD will continue to publish research and case studies, and invite experts from other fields like customer experience and data science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>. A key future direction is **benchmarking** by comparing similar processes (e.g., passport renewal) across countries to identify sludge and areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.

## International Case Studies

### France: Assistance for Independent Living (APA)
The French behavioral insights team, which previously focused on administrative simplification, used the Sludge Academy to apply a more methodical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. They audited the *Assistance for Independent Living* (APA) application process, which helps elderly people benefit from aid to stay at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. The administration reported breakouts and abandonment at different stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.

The audit involved interviewing 20 people across nine departments, including caregivers, applicants, and departmental council members, and reviewing existing forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. This user-centric approach systematically revealed the complexities and associated psychological costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. It helped prioritize problematic areas beyond just language, focusing on processes that created inequality or complex steps for specific users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. The audit was multi-dimensional, including insights on psychological costs and inclusion issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. A key benefit was showing the administration how to autonomously diagnose and replicate these audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. Challenges included a lack of objective data, requiring extensive information gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.

### Brazil: Gov.br Account Recovery
Brazil's Ministry of Management and Innovation in Public Services audited the recovery process for "Gov.br" accounts, the main entry point to over 4,000 digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. While well-designed for automated recovery via digital and facial recognition, a significant number of vulnerable users (over 100 million requests annually) must use a more costly and difficult online form process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.

Learnings from the Sludge Academy led Brazil to develop its own [[tools_and_methodologies_for_sludge_audits | tool]] and methodology, adapted for Portuguese speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. Their method focuses on understanding the context and mapping user journeys, recognizing that different groups have different journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. An "equity check" helps identify where specific populations need more guidance to avoid sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. They are iterating prototypes and aim for a self-applied tool for use by federal, state, and municipal governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.

Key takeaways for Brazil include:
*   [[sludge_audits_and_their_impact_on_government_services | Sludge audits]] are a good entry point for behavioral insights in government, as they simplify communication and present results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.
*   The sludge audit tool itself should be designed to avoid sludge (e.g., reducing questionnaire length) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.
*   The term "sludge" can have negative connotations in some contexts (like Brazil's "audits"), suggesting a need for more positive framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.
*   [[sludge_audits_and_their_impact_on_government_services | Sludge reduction]] is crucial for promoting inclusiveness, equity, and public perception of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>.

## Broader Impact and Rationale

Professor Cass Sunstein highlights that even perfectly rational people can struggle with sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>. However, human beings suffer from "bounded irrationality," including unrealistic optimism, procrastination, and present bias, which exacerbate the problems of sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. Cognitive scarcity, particularly for the elderly, sick, or poor, makes sludge especially challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>.

The ability to conduct [[sludge_audits_and_their_impact_on_government_services | sludge audits]] and understand its magnitude allows for targeted interventions. Examples include:
*   A "personage" in Washington DC struggling with the immigration system, requiring a lawyer to navigate bureaucratic sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.
*   Eliminating sludge for poor children to receive free school meals via "direct certification," benefiting over 10 million children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>.
*   Changing worker authorization renewal periods from 180 to 540 days, significantly cutting sludge for both vulnerable workers and their employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.

These examples underscore that [[sludge_audits_and_their_impact_on_government_services | sludge reduction]] is not just about administrative efficiency, but about reshaping public services to be more equitable, accessible, and trusted, particularly among vulnerable populations who are most reliant on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The ultimate goal is to give people more time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>.

## Call to Action

The OECD is developing a recommendation for an [[international_cooperation_and_data_standards | international standard]] on human-centered public administrative services, open for public consultation until July 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This standard will provide a common policy framework to guide governments in designing and delivering people-centric services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Governments are encouraged to download and read the "Fixing Frictions" publication, which provides nine good practice principles for assessing, planning, and conducting a [[sludge_audits_and_their_impact_on_government_services | sludge audit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>. Participation in the next [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | International Sludge Academy]] is also encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. The true impact comes from acting in response to audits to create better services, better government, and better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

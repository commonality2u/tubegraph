[[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | Sludge]], defined as unnecessary frictions that impede access to services, impose psychological costs, and erode trust, is a pervasive barrier in government services and processes worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Efforts to reduce [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge]] are crucial for making governments more effective, equitable, and responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. [[international_collaboration_on_innovation | International collaboration]] plays a significant role in addressing this challenge, leveraging shared methodologies and experiences across diverse contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>.

## The Problem of Sludge

[[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | Sludge]] typically manifests as hard-to-find information, processes that are difficult to understand or complete, long waiting times without updates, and complex decision points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. While often unintentional, these frictions lead to significant "psychological costs" for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. These costs include:
*   **Search costs:** When individuals spend time looking for hard-to-find information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
*   **Decision costs:** The mental effort involved in evaluating complex options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.
*   **Cognitive costs:** The mental resources required to fulfill requirements or understand complex information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional costs:** Stress, anxiety, frustration, perceived loss of autonomy, or feelings of stigma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

These psychological costs disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including those who are ill, poor, or experiencing challenging life events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:34:00">[53:34:00]</a>. Sludge erodes trust in public institutions, making it harder for governments to implement policy reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## The International Sludge Academy

The OECD, through its Network for Behavioral Insights Experts in Government, has established the International Sludge Academy as a platform for [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | international collaboration]] on behavioral sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This initiative, inspired by Professor Cass Sunstein's work, aims to mainstream [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge audits]] across public administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

### The First International Sludge Academy
Launched in collaboration with the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Customer Service in Australia, the first International Sludge Academy enabled 16 teams from 14 countries to conduct parallel [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge audits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>. The NSW team, developers of the [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge audit]] methodology, guided officials from other countries in deploying their method through masterclasses and one-on-one mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.

The methodology is unique in its focus on the psychological aspects of burden, bringing a behavioral lens to service improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:15]</a>. It addresses gaps by systematically incorporating behavioral science evidence, quantifying different aspects of [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge]] (including psychological costs and equity), and providing data-driven prioritization for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>. The four key metrics considered are time, cost, effort, and inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>.

The academy demonstrated a global desire to reduce [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge]], with participating governments auditing a diverse range of processes, from citizen-facing public services to internal government HR services (e.g., Canada, federal Australia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>.

### Key Learnings and Principles

Based on the first academy's experience, nine good practice principles were identified to support governments in assessing and preventing [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>:
*   **Controllability:** Prioritizing audits where there's control over implementing solutions to ensure a direct impact on user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>.
*   **Common Methodology:** Using a predefined, tested, and replicable methodology ensures rigor and allows for comparisons across different contexts and over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>.
*   **Tailoring to Context:** Adapting the audit for complex, non-linear behavioral journeys and different customer segments (e.g., Finnish team conducted multiple audits for diverse customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.
*   **Equity Lens:** Explicitly deploying an equity lens throughout the process, focusing on underserved communities disproportionately affected by [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>.
*   **Evaluating Progress:** Translating audit findings into tangible changes and re-auditing services to measure impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:00">[26:41:00]</a>.
*   **System Enablers:** Recognizing the need for government commitment to improving user services, close connection to service owners, and systematic customer survey data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>.

## International Case Studies

The academy fostered a collaborative environment where countries shared their experiences and learned from each other's challenges and successes.

### France: Assistance for Independent Living (APA)
The French behavioral insights team applied the [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge audit]] to the APA application process, which helps elderly people access aid to stay at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. The administration reported high abandonment rates due to complexity and varying letter versions across territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>.

The audit involved:
*   **Extensive Interviews:** 20 people across nine departments, including caregivers, applicants, and professionals, to understand the process from different angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>.
*   **Form Review and Walk-throughs:** Step-by-step analysis of existing forms with applicants, identifying time taken, letters required, and emotional responses (frustration, abandonment points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>.

The findings helped prioritize problematic areas beyond just language, focusing on steps creating inequality or extreme complexity for specific users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:38:00">[33:38:00]</a>. The process was user-centric, provided objective analysis, and was multi-dimensional, including psychological costs and inclusion issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>. A key benefit was showing the administration how to autonomously diagnose and replicate these audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>. Challenges included a lack of objective initial data and deciding whether to create a full-time [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge audit]] position or train administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:00">[34:58:00]</a>.

### Brazil: Go.br Account Recovery
Brazil's Ministry of Management and Innovation in Public Services audited the recovery process for the Go.br account, the main entry point to over 4,000 digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>. While well-designed for most, a significant challenge existed for users unable to use automated digital or facial recognition recovery, forcing them into a more costly and difficult online form process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>. This affected a large proportion of the 150 million annual users, particularly the most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>.

Learning from the academy, Brazil is developing its own [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge audit]] tool and methodology, emphasizing a systematic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a>. Their prototypes aim to understand context and map user journeys, specifically recognizing different journeys for diverse citizen groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15:00">[39:15:00]</a>. This includes an "equity check" to identify where vulnerable populations need more guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:43:00">[39:43:00]</a>. The goal is a self-applied tool for use by federal, state, and municipal governments across Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:00">[40:28:00]</a>.

Key takeaways for Brazil included the realization that [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge audits]] are an effective entry point for behavioral insights in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:56:00">[40:56:00]</a>. They also focused on designing the audit tool to avoid [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge]] itself (e.g., reducing questionnaire length) and reframing the term "sludge" for better communication in their context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:09:00">[41:09:00]</a>. Brazil sees [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge reduction]] as crucial for promoting inclusiveness, equity, and public perception of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:59:00">[41:59:00]</a>.

## Future Directions

The success of the first International Sludge Academy highlights the need for continued [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | international collaboration on governance innovation]] in [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge reduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:43:00">[43:43:00]</a>. Plans for a second International Sludge Academy include:
*   **Diverse Activities:** Catering to teams with different needs, from independent audit capabilities to those requiring more foundational support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>.
*   **Methodological Development:** Further refining the [[sludge_audits_and_their_global_impact | sludge audit]] method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:08:00">[43:08:00]</a>.
*   **Broader Participation:** Opening participation beyond behavioral science teams to include program, policy, and service delivery teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:21:00">[43:21:00]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Peer Learning:** Fostering a stronger community for knowledge sharing and mutual advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:47:00">[43:47:00]</a>.
*   **Research and Publications:** Collating knowledge and presenting it through publications and case studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:06:00">[44:06:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-Disciplinary Learning:** Inviting experts from fields like customer experience and data science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:21:00">[44:21:00]</a>.
*   **Benchmarking:** Bringing countries together to compare common processes (e.g., passport renewal) to identify best practices and areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:37:00">[44:37:00]</a>.

The OECD is also developing an international standard on human-centered public administrative services, currently open for public consultation, which aims to set a clear policy framework for people-centered design and delivery of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. These efforts demonstrate the commitment to [[government_collaboration_to_tackle_global_challenges | government collaboration to tackle global challenges]] and improve public services worldwide.

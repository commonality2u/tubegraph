Governments must innovate to address current challenges, adapt to an evolving world, and prepare for future uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This involves changing approaches to deliver new or better value for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Reasons for Innovation in Government

### 1. Enhancing Impact and Value
Governments have not yet solved all the problems faced by their citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. By innovating and changing their approaches, governments can become more impactful, delivering new or better value to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### 2. Adapting to a Changing Environment
The world is continually changing around governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Many existing governmental systems, such as healthcare, welfare, and taxation, were designed in the 1950s and no longer align with today's realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Key shifts necessitating [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]] include:
*   **Digitalization and Online Services** The prevalence of online activities means citizens expect the same ease of experience when interacting with government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The massive digitalization around us requires governments to [[adapting_government_systems_to_modern_needs | adapt]] to new systems like "rotation technology" or digital use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Evolving Societal Needs** People's needs and ways of living have changed significantly since the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Governments must respond to these new societal demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### 3. Anticipating Future Challenges
Governments must also look forward and prepare for fundamental changes and challenges that lie ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This involves dealing with complex challenges and uncertainties, such as:
*   Climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Aging populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   Emerging new types of societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

To address these, governments need to [[anticipatory_innovation_and_engaging_with_the_future | anticipate the future]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This requires innovation and a different kind of thinking today to be ready for tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Anticipating these future changes is crucial, as they will fundamentally alter how governments and people function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

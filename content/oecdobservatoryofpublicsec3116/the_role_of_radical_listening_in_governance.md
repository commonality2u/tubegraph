The COVID-19 crisis has provided a new impetus for innovation in public sector practices globally, from small teams to broad learning communities, emphasizing a heightened sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A key reflection from this period, particularly highlighted by the Aftershock Dialogues Network, points to the evolving nature of public sector innovation and what [[governance | government]] can expect in the future, particularly regarding the need to "push the boundaries of the conventional to spur lasting transformation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Imperative of Radical Listening

A significant learning from the pandemic is the collective failure to adequately listen, or to engage in "radically listen[ing]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Many believe that if this skill had been mastered, the current struggles on numerous fronts would be less severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Challenges to Effective Listening in Governance
*   **Outdated Decision-Making Paradigms**: Much decision-making has been based on an outdated idea that [[governance | governments]] inherently know what to do, will announce it, and people will simply follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This notion of [[governance | government]] possessing all answers is now unraveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Immature Participatory Democracy**: The mechanisms for effective listening are underdeveloped, revealing that [[participatory_processes_and_governance | participative democracy]] is still very immature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Spaces for collaboration and discussion are limited, allowing power to be quickly assumed by a select few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Lack of Empathy and Learning Optimization**: Current systems often lack empathy and compassion and are not optimized for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Traditionally, these characteristics have been considered secondary to effective [[governance | government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Historical Trust Deficits**: In places like the United States, [[governance | governments]] are asking citizens to trust systems that have historically treated people unequally and let them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Siloed Operations**: A persistent challenge within [[governance | government]] is its siloed nature, often leading to "shouting" rather than listening between departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

### Benefits and Emerging Practices
When listening is executed well, it can foster [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | trust]], allow relationships to flourish, and enable positive outcomes even in dire circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. While there is no single, universal prescription for listening, its value lies in learning how to respond to crises like COVID-19 and empowering people to contribute to future ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

Through radical listening, some communities have successfully created platforms to be heard, leading to faster and better feedback loops, even amidst a pandemic and centralized [[governance | government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This approach has allowed individuals who previously felt excluded to gain a voice within [[governance | government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Listening should be a continuous learning process, not merely for control or extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. As one community leader stated, "you need to build the road ahead with the same people you kicked out the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>.

## Connection to Trust and Evolving Governance
The conversation around radical listening intersects with the broader themes of [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | trust]] and the evolving nature of [[governance | government]]. Governments that made prior investments in basic and fundamental infrastructure, including social capital and [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | trust]], had more options to improvise and innovate during the emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. In conditions where [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | social capital and trust]] were high, new opportunities for collaboration, including public-private partnerships, were unlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

The role of [[governance | government]] is suggested to shift from knowing all the answers to enabling spaces for listening, learning, and collaboration to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>. This involves sharing power, rather than giving it up, and encouraging a culture where good ideas emerge, and people feel jointly responsible for actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>. This approach leads to more realistic accountability in complex times where no single person holds all the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The pandemic has prompted a questioning of traditional policymaking, moving towards a mindset of "thinking like a system, acting like an entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. It has also exposed the inadequacy of a transactional model of public services (as seen in "new public management") and highlighted the importance of shifting to a relational model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. This relational model views public services as the outcome of collaboration between the state, citizens, and communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. The future of [[governance | public services]] lies in the ability to combine technocratic advancements (e.g., [[digital_transformation_in_governance | digital transformation]], analytical skills) with this relational imperative, driven by notions like [[participatory_processes_and_governance | deliberative democracy]] and community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

Despite concerns that [[governance | governments]] might revert to old practices, there's optimism that movements within communities are already demonstrating how [[governance | government]] can operate more effectively, with or without central [[governance | government]]'s immediate embrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. The public is showing increased maturity in understanding complexity and the need for rapid adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. Ultimately, people are not "hard to reach"; they are "seldom heard" and can be the greatest advocates for [[governance | government]]'s recovery and rebuild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.

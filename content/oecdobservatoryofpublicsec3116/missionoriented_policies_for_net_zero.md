A report titled "Harnessing Mission Governance to Achieve National Climate Targets" was launched to analyze how 15 countries' climate mitigation reports align with a [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | mission governance]] structure, identify gaps, and suggest ways to strengthen efforts towards net zero policies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The report aims to address whether existing governance structures are adequate to achieve [[missionoriented_portfolio_management | mission-oriented]] outcomes for national climate targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>, especially given that many Paris Agreement commitments are not being met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.

## Current Landscape of Climate Action

Significant progress has been made in clean energy markets, driven by government policies and market realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. In the past year, global investment in renewables and low-carbon technologies reached $2 trillion USD, double the amount spent on fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. Approximately 40 countries have successfully decoupled emissions from GDP growth, demonstrating that climate action can coexist with economic expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Stronger climate action can even provide an economic boost, with a projected net gain of 0.2% in global GDP by 2040 and up to 13% by 2100 when factoring in avoided climate damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

However, the momentum for climate action is at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The pace of climate policy adoption and strengthening has slowed to 1-2% per year, down from 10% annually in previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Challenges to Climate Mitigation Policies

Several challenges impede effective climate mitigation:
*   **Slowing Policy Adoption** The rate of climate policy adoption and stringency has decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Economic and Geopolitical Strains** Slower global growth, geopolitical tensions, and rising public debt strain government budgets, diverting focus from climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Shifting Government Priorities** Climate change is no longer consistently a front-page headline, and government priorities are shifting, sometimes reflecting changes in administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Public and Political Pushback** Some sectors, like agriculture in Europe, show resistance, risking a decline in public and political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. There's also a perception that climate action reduces economic opportunities or that the net zero transition isn't investable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Innovation Insufficiency** While innovation has driven progress in areas like clean energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, the current pace of innovation is insufficient to meet carbon neutrality goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Climate-related patent filings have decreased as a share of all patenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Efforts often focus on incremental innovation and deployment of existing technologies rather than R&D for entirely new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Political Polarization** Climate change is increasingly politicized, hindering decarbonization efforts worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Harder-to-Abate Sectors** Significant progress has been made in decarbonizing sectors like power, but less has been done in harder-to-abate sectors like agriculture and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Weak Governance** Inadequate governmental channels often fail to ensure climate policy is informed by science and brings the public and stakeholders along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Short Time Horizons** Short electoral cycles lead to policy flip-flops, making consistent long-term policymaking challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Siloed Approach** A common challenge is the perception that climate policy is solely the responsibility of "climate people" rather than a cross-cutting, whole-of-government endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Capacity constraints at local levels, narrow KPIs, and siloed budgets hinder collaboration, potentially leading to contradictory actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Bureaucratic Inefficiencies** Bureaucratic processes can impede implementation, even with high-level presidential backing, due to slow progress and internal resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.

## Mission Governance as a Solution

[[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | Mission governance]] is a powerful tool to address these challenges, aligning with broader public administration reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>.

### Core Functions of Mission-Oriented Policies
[[mission_setting_and_policy_making | Mission-oriented policies]] are defined by three core functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>:
1.  **Orientation**: Establishing clear goals and strategic agendas across silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
2.  **Coordination**: Aligning plans and budgets towards these goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.
3.  **Collective Action**: Allowing cooperation for mission delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

### Pillars of Effective Mission Governance

A comprehensive [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | mission governance]] framework consists of five pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>:

1.  **Structures**:
    *   **Clear and Measurable Objectives**: Missions establish clear, measurable objectives that anchor climate commitments within government strategic planning, prioritizing climate mitigation and adaptation at the highest institutional levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>. This guides resource allocation and enables stronger cross-sectoral coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. For example, the UK has embedded [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | mission governance]] at the center of government through its dedicated Cabinet Committee on Climate Change, chaired by the Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>.
    *   **Legal & Institutional Arrangements**: Climate framework laws provide transparency and a long-term perspective (e.g., UK Climate Change Act, New Zealand Climate Change Response) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.
    *   **High-Level Bodies & Mission Management Teams**: Responsible bodies (e.g., UK Cabinet Committee on Climate Change, France's General Secretariat for Ecological Planning) and dedicated mission management teams ensure accountability and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.

2.  **Strategic Orientation**:
    *   **Roadmaps & Political Consensus**: Roadmaps connecting to specific mission actions are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. Sustained political action across electoral cycles, as seen in Canada's political consensus on climate targets or Sweden's cross-sectoral approaches, helps tackle political support issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
    *   **Societal Engagement & Public Participation**: Engaging diverse stakeholders (business, civil society, local communities, citizens) is essential for legitimacy and long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Mission governance incorporates participatory processes at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Examples include citizen councils in Sweden and the UK, and extensive stakeholder consultations in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.

3.  **Coordination**:
    *   **Horizontal Coordination**: Mechanisms involving different government bodies (e.g., France's General Secretariat for Ecological Planning) help align action across ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.
    *   **Vertical Alignment**: Ensuring targets are aligned across national, provincial, and local levels (e.g., Chile's regional climate change council) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.
    *   **Mobilization of External Actors**: Systematically involving communities, the private sector, and non-profits remains a challenge, though initiatives like Sweden's Fossil-Free Sweden involve private actors in climate target planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.

4.  **Execution**:
    *   **Capabilities & Expertise**: Strengthening capabilities of public officials and institutions is vital, requiring technical expertise and adaptive policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Sweden's Impact Innovation Programs, for example, include an accelerator function to build public sector capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
    *   **Evidence-Based Decision-Making**: Integrating robust data and continuous learning into the governance process enables effective measurement of progress and policy adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This includes robust data systems and regular assessment mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. [[evaluation_and_metrics_in_missionoriented_policy | Evaluation and metrics in mission-oriented policy]] is critical.
    *   **Experimentation & Flexibility**: Explicitly embedding principles of experimentation and iterative learning allows policies to be continuously refined based on evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Denmark's "inomissions" explicitly integrate experimentation within mission portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. This is one of the most lagging areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.
    *   **Broad Policy Mix**: Effective missions require access to a comprehensive mix of policy instruments, including legal, market-creating, regulatory, and skills development approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>.

5.  **Resources**:
    *   **Long-Term Commitment & Public Funding**: Ensuring long-term financial commitment is challenging but can be built into the [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | mission governance]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. Germany's climate action program exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.
    *   **Private Investment & Market Shaping**: Crowding in resources from external actors, especially private investment, is a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. This requires ensuring investor confidence and shaping markets through policies like Denmark's carbon tax on agriculture or the UK's zero-emission vehicle measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>.

### "STI Trap" and Systemic Transformation

Previous [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] efforts, like the Apollo program, focused on scientific and technological breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. However, today's missions require systemic transformations across entire socio-technical systems, extending beyond technology to include skills, infrastructure, user behaviors, business models (e.g., circular economy), and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

A common challenge is the "STI trap," where [[mission_oriented_innovation_strategies and practices | mission-oriented innovation strategies and practices]], despite their broad goals, remain primarily led by and resourced through science, technology, and innovation (STI) authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>. This results in a mismatch between ambitious targets and the actual policy mix mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:44">[01:35:44]</a>. To escape this trap, missions need access to a broader range of public interventions and funding, including support for regulatory change, skill development, and economic incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[01:36:02]</a>.

## Implementation Pathways for Mission-Oriented Policies

Several scenarios exist for evolving [[missionoriented_innovation | innovation missions]] into true transition missions:

1.  **Gradual Broadening**: Missions can learn and adapt, gradually building trust, improving integration, and becoming transformative over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:35">[01:37:35]</a>.
2.  **Transfer of Leadership**: Mission leadership can shift from STI authorities to "challenge owners" (e.g., environment, transport ministries). This can be sensitive due to political turf and budget competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>.
3.  **Dedicated Mission Agencies**: Missions could be led by dedicated agencies reporting to multiple ministries, fostering cross-ministerial cooperation (e.g., Research Council of Norway) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:26">[01:38:26]</a>.
4.  **Elevation to Central Government**: Missions can be elevated to central government bodies like the Prime Minister's office or powerful transition committees, ensuring broad political support and a whole-of-government approach (e.g., France, Japan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:12">[01:39:12]</a>.
5.  **Regional and Local Missions**: Operating missions at regional or local levels ("micro-missions") can alleviate governance challenges and foster stronger private stakeholder engagement (e.g., city climate contracts in Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:25">[01:40:25]</a>.

### Role of Climate Councils

Climate councils play a key role in strengthening [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | climate governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. They are typically set up to advise governments and parliaments on climate policies, grounded in scientific evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. Their functions include:
*   **Assessing Progress**: Providing independent assessments of progress against targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.
*   **Forward-Looking Advice**: Offering advice on how to achieve long-term targets and advising on policies and sectoral pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.
*   **Anchoring to Government**: Councils can serve as anchors to the center of government, ensuring coordination and alignment (e.g., South Africa's Presidential Climate Change Commission, chaired by the President) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
*   **Bridging Science and Policy**: They bridge the gap between climate science and policy implementation, particularly in harder-to-abate sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Building Trust**: By operating independently and basing advice on evidence, climate councils can help build public trust in institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:57">[02:02:57]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook

Integrating [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | mission governance]] principles into national climate efforts is crucial to make them systematic and concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. This involves developing targeted missions for specific sub-targets with clear commitments and timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. A [[public_sector_adoption_of_mission_oriented_approaches | mission-oriented approach]] can strengthen political support and societal engagement, moving beyond crisis-driven responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>. Enhancing [[missionoriented_innovation | innovation and experimentation]] in climate policy and integrating it into current actions is also encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>.

The work on [[mission_governance_in_achieving_climate_targets | mission governance]] for climate action is a continuous process of learning and adaptation, highlighting the need for long-term conversations and cross-learning among countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The OECD's Mission Action Lab aims to support the [[impact_and_scaling_of_mission_oriented_policies | implementation and scaling]] of missions by fostering a community of practice for mission managers and sharing practical examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:09">[01:43:09]</a>.

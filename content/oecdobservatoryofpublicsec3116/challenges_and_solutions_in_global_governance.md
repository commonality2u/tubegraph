The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly highlighted the complexities and necessity of international collaboration in addressing [[challenges and success factors in crossborder governance|global challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. While the crisis initially led to a focus on national responses, it underscored the critical need for national governments to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The *Government Aftershock* initiative by the OECD aims to improve collective learning and sensemaking of the crisis and its implications for governments as an institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.

## Impact of the Crisis on International Cooperation

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on [[challenges in fostering international cooperation|international cooperation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, being a truly global crisis that requires global cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Despite this, trends towards unilateralism and even conflict between nations were reinforced by the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

While the international scientific community demonstrated strong collaboration, sharing DNA sequences of the virus and research for vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, cooperation between governments was "far more haphazard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The initial reflex of many countries, particularly powerful and developed ones, was to turn inward, leading to export bans and individual measures without necessarily learning or coordinating with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

This crisis revealed that purely national responses to intrinsically global issues are inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, as exemplified by the global health system being "only as effective as its weakest link" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. A key takeaway is the clear mismatch between today's global realities, which call for cooperation, and the legal and regulatory processes of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>.

## Key Challenges in Global Governance

Several fundamental problems hinder optimal international cooperation:

### Politics, Financing, and Capacity
These are traditional [[challenges faced by governments|challenges faced by governments]] that existed before COVID-19 but were highlighted by the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Politics:** States are often unwilling to grant international organizations enforcement or inspection powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Geopolitical issues and diverse interests make reaching agreements difficult, especially in multilateral settings like the WTO, where negotiations have been deadlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   **Financing:** Chronic underfunding of organizations like the WHO limits their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
*   **Capacity:** Many developing countries lack the resources and capacity to implement international obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Digital Divide
A significant new challenge is the digital divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Different countries gather data in different ways, making it difficult to create interoperability between data and digital technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This impacts areas like health, where reliance on a common set of data is crucial, and trade, where technologies like blockchain for supply chain monitoring face interoperability risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

### Limitations of Traditional Multilateralism
International organizations, while crucial for supporting members in policy development, are sometimes viewed as "distant bureaucracies" or "slow political machinery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. They have struggled to remain inclusive, consult efficiently with stakeholders, assess their impact, and coordinate with other bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. The crisis exacerbated these [[challenges in governmental innovation and reform|challenges in governmental innovation and reform]] by making international meetings difficult, which impacted rulemaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## Emerging Solutions and Approaches

Despite the [[challenges in fostering international cooperation|challenges in fostering international cooperation]], the crisis also triggered a quick emergence of high-level calls for collaboration, leading to actual collective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

### Informal Collaboration and New Mechanisms
Beyond codified rules, less formal collaboration has proven vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. The **International Scientific Community** has come together to share research and data for vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Informal discussions and information sharing have been nimble and successful, especially in technical institutes like WIPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. The shift to "hybrid" discussions, accommodating delegates in different time zones, has shown flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

### Role of International Organizations and Reforms
International organizations provide institutional frameworks and expertise to foster collaboration, facilitating exchanges of experience and scientific knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Efforts are underway to rethink multilateralism by building on past and ongoing reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
*   **Adapting to new realities:** Many international organizations are undergoing ambitious reforms to better consult stakeholders, assess instrument implementation, and coordinate with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Virtual Adaptation:** Organizations have adapted working methods to allow virtual decision-making and rule adoption under short-time pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Targeted Responses:** Organizations like the OECD, International Civil Aviation Organization, and Interpol have offered targeted policy advice, quick reference guides, and guidelines to help governments and protect people during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Collective Improvement:** The IO Partnership for Effective International Rulemaking, involving 50 IO partners, is committed to improving the quality of rulemaking by focusing on making international rules more inclusive, effective, systematically implemented, and coherent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

### Multi-stakeholder Partnerships
The crisis has underscored the rise of multi-stakeholder partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   **COVAX:** A multilateral initiative bringing together 160+ states, non-state actors, the private sector, and philanthropic foundations (like the Gates Foundation) to ensure universal access to vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Governments working with Business:** Businesses quickly adapted production (e.g., a vodka company making hand sanitizer) and worked with governments and municipalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. [[Privatepublic partnerships in addressing global challenges|Private-public partnerships]] in research have also led to unprecedented achievements, such as rapid vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Transgovernmental Networks of Regulators:** These bodies bring together specialized national government units and non-governmental actors to develop specialized instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Technological Solutions and Digital Collaboration
Technology facilitates new forms of collaboration to overcome the digital divide and enhance efficiency.
*   **IP Global AI Network (IP GAN):** Developed by IP Australia with support from the UK, Europeans, and Americans, this platform fosters international collaboration and co-development of AI and machine learning practices for patent offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. It functions like an app store to share AI tools and code, reduce duplication, and enable less well-resourced offices to access expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This represents a more structured shared space beyond informal discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Open Societies and Trade Deals
The drawbacks of protectionism and trade restrictions became evident during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Trade Facilitation Agreement (WTO):** This agreement acted as an "unsung hero" by removing red tape for essential goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP):** The conclusion of this major trade deal during the pandemic, involving one-third of the global population, demonstrates a realization that reducing unnecessary burdens and fostering trade are crucial in a globalized world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Global Supply Chains:** The crisis highlighted the interconnectedness of global supply chains, where products are "made in the global world" rather than a single country, underscoring the need to restore trust in these chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Rethinking Multilateralism for Future Shocks

To face future [[policy experimentation and global challenges|global challenges]], which are transboundary in nature, and prepare for future crises, international [[challenges and solutions in public policy implementation|regulatory cooperation]] must be strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This means making cooperation effective and systematic, not just a response to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

The notion of the nation-state is not outdated, given the rise of populism and nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. However, other organizing models based on interests, such as multinational companies, NGOs, and virtual groups, operate beyond territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. These groups are increasingly working alongside governments, indicating a rise in multi-stakeholder partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Governments are becoming more dependent on non-state actors for data and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

The most fundamental change needed is to pursue collaboration across borders through the application of technology, involving NGOs, businesses, and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>. An open society, [[challenges in fostering international cooperation|international cooperation]], and trade are considered the best solutions to prepare for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

[[Adaptive innovation | Organizational adaptation]] and sense-making are crucial for public sector entities to navigate complex and uncertain environments, especially when dealing with wicked problems like [[Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. This approach moves beyond traditional, static management models towards continuous learning and responsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.

## The Role of Sense-Making in Innovation Portfolios

Sense-making is defined as the activity of understanding what an organization is learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. In the context of [[Adaptive innovation | innovation portfolios]], it involves analyzing feedback from external activities to determine what is working and what is not, informing future actions and resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. This process is particularly vital when operating under high levels of uncertainty, where complete information for decision-making is rarely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>.

Key aspects of sense-making include:
*   **Collective Intelligence** Using diverse voices and perspectives from various colleagues and organizational parts to make decisions and review existing initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. This helps to address inherent biases and harness broader insights, especially when working within complex systems with multiple markets and supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
*   **De-coupling Expertise** Recognizing that expertise is only one input among many, and avoiding reliance solely on traditional "expert" voices. This encourages open-mindedness and broadens thinking about who holds valuable knowledge for a given problem or decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on Systemic Learning** Shifting from viewing projects merely as execution tools to experimental means of learning about and tackling problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>. This enables continuous adaptation based on experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>.

## Organizational Adaptation through Portfolio Approaches

Implementing a [[Adaptive innovation | portfolio approach]] often leads to significant organizational change, influencing behaviors, culture, and business processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>. It acts as an agent of change both internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. This transformation can push individuals and organizations out of their comfort zones, leading to learning and shifts in behavior and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.

Strategies for fostering organizational adaptation:
*   **Moving from Supply-Driven to Demand-Driven** Focusing on identifying and working with "challenge owners" who truly experience the problems, rather than assuming expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. This helps in understanding inherent biases and distinguishes between influencers/power-holders and actual problem owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>.
*   **Creating Space for Outliers** Allowing for serendipity and working with unusual actors to prevent tight siloing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.
*   **Building Capabilities** Investing in internal capability building and perspective exploration to ensure that diverse voices are not only heard but also genuinely integrated into decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>.
*   **Iterative Change, Not Radical Overhaul** Instead of initiating change with a radical organizational restructuring, it is more effective to start by building coalitions of "the willing" within existing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. [[Systems thinking in policymaking | Problem framing]] and portfolio design should precede major organizational changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.
*   **Projects as Organizational Prototypes** Using projects, missions, or programs as a means to sketch out and discover what the ideal organizational structure might be, rather than designing the organization *a priori* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>. This enables continuous learning and adaptation based on lived experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:45">[01:18:45]</a>.

## Leadership for Adaptation

A new form of leadership is emerging that focuses on enabling transformation rather than being solely an expert in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. This **systems leadership** emphasizes collaboration across different people within a system to achieve desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>. Leaders in this context must be willing to embrace discomfort and uncertainty, letting go of the need to have all the answers or be the sole discoverer of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. The aim is to build resilient processes not overly dependent on individual "hero leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.

[[Understanding and utilizing strategic foresight | Strategic foresight]] involves creating knowledge about the future from existing factors, values, worldviews, assumptions, and emerging developments, feeding into the action of anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>. However, insights from strategic foresight often face significant [[Challenges and solutions in foresight implementation | implementation challenges]] and can be ignored in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

## Challenges in Foresight Implementation

Several factors contribute to the difficulty of implementing [[Understanding and utilizing strategic foresight | strategic foresight]] insights:

### The "Innovator's Dilemma" in Government
Established practices and policies can become outdated, but stakeholders connected to current services may provide misleading information, as they might not see the need for early thinking about future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. New ideas, especially in their imperfect initial stages, often underperform existing systems, leading to resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>.

Current leadership's focus on immediate challenges can divert attention from upcoming risks or opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>. There is also an inherent resistance to change within organizations, as they are accustomed to current performance and are reluctant to pursue dramatically different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. Ignoring new transformations, however, can lead to irrelevancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

### The Control Dilemma for Governments
Governments face a dilemma regarding control over developments like technology. In the early phases of technological development, the possibility to control change is much larger, but evidence of potential impacts is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. Conversely, as innovations mature and their impacts become evident, the ability to control them diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>. This requires governments to think about changes early on, accepting the need to experiment and create evidence rather than adopting a "wait and see" position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>.

### Static vs. Continuous Futures Thinking
Governments often approach the future from a static perspective, using tools like the futures cone as a one-off exercise to input into a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. However, this is ineffective because the future is dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>. Effective anticipatory practice requires a continuous dialogue and ongoing action to influence the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:46">[01:16:46]</a>.

### The Impact Gap of Strategic Foresight
A significant challenge is the "impact gap" between [[Understanding and utilizing strategic foresight | strategic foresight]] insights and their practical application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>.

Reasons for this gap include:
*   **Undesirable Information** [[Challenges and solutions in foresight implementation | Strategic foresight]] often produces information that questions current practices, making it undesirable to those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:57">[01:59:57]</a>.
*   **Lack of Implementation Mechanisms** Without concrete actions or mechanisms to enforce ideas, it's easy for challenges to be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:14">[02:00:14]</a>.
*   **Leadership Focus** Leaders may be preoccupied with current challenges, taking away from looking at upcoming risks or opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:47">[02:21:47]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Challenge** There is an aversion to having assumptions and values challenged, especially if the future suggests current approaches are wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:19">[02:22:19]</a>. This requires leaders to be open-minded and welcome critical insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:26">[02:22:26]</a>.
*   **"Cassandra Effects"** Individuals who foresee significant changes may not be believed or their warnings acted upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Political Pressures** Elected leaders often face public pressure to have immediate answers and control the future, making it difficult to embrace uncertainty or potential negative forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:20">[02:54:20]</a>.
*   **Denial of Uncertainty** There's a tendency to make policy problems seem linear and predictable, and to avoid acknowledging potential issues that might then become one's responsibility to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:41">[02:52:41]</a>.

An example of this impact gap is the global pandemic forecasts of 2017. Governments in the U.S., UK, and elsewhere had good scenarios forecasting global pandemics, yet very little was done based on this information, leading to a reactive rather than anticipatory response in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:58">[02:42:58]</a>.

## Addressing Implementation Challenges: Anticipatory Innovation Governance

To overcome these challenges, the concept of [[Role of Strategic Foresight in Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation governance]] has been developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. This framework aims to connect the knowledge creation of foresight with the action of innovation, supported by a governance system that enables and evaluates this activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:37">[02:36:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

### Building an Anticipatory Organization
Building an anticipatory innovation governance system focuses on five key elements:
1.  **Demand**: Cultivating a leadership culture that actively seeks [[Understanding and utilizing strategic foresight | strategic foresight]] and anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
2.  **Capacity**: Developing the knowledge and skills necessary, such as having horizon scanners and scenario planners embedded within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
3.  **Embeddedness**: Ensuring that other systemic elements, like electoral cycles and policy reviews, are coordinated with anticipatory activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. It's crucial to know how and when insights will be implemented to prevent them from "going to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
4.  **Institutions and Teams**: Establishing dedicated teams responsible for anticipatory innovation and ensuring they connect with broader organizational functions that can act on their discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.
5.  **Feedback**: Implementing systems to evaluate how well anticipatory work was used, allowing for continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

Finland is cited as an example of a country with an advanced [[Integrating strategic foresight into government organizations | strategic foresight system]] that focuses on these elements, with multiple teams across ministries and a parliamentary committee dedicated to the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. The Swedish city of Helsingborg also provides a city-level example, building leadership capacity and funding anticipatory innovation projects to become a "test bed for the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.

### Distinguishing Anticipation from Resilience and Adaptation
While often discussed together, it's crucial to differentiate these concepts:
*   **Resilience** aims to make a system more prepared for shocks, allowing it to expand without breaking and uphold core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:33">[03:33:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:50">[03:41:50]</a>. However, it may not address fundamental changes that require new structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:20">[03:44:20]</a>. [[Understanding and utilizing strategic foresight | Strategic foresight]] can inform resilience but is not synonymous with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:16">[02:29:16]</a>.
*   **Adaptation/Agility** refers to the capacity for tactical responses and quick changes during ongoing events, often without extensive strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:18">[03:51:18]</a>.
*   **Anticipation** is distinct as it provides information about when a system should fundamentally change rather than just be resilient, and helps ensure that adaptive actions are aligned with desired future directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:55">[03:49:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. It makes both resilient and adaptive capacities much stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

### Strategic Foresight in Mission-Oriented Innovation
[[Integration of strategic foresight in mission development | Strategic foresight]] complements mission-driven innovation, which is focused on a single, agreed-upon purpose (e.g., decarbonization goals like the Paris Agreement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. While missions activate efforts towards a goal, [[Understanding and utilizing strategic foresight | strategic foresight]] helps anticipate unexpected technological solutions or the rippling side effects of mission implementation (e.g., job displacement from green transitions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.

### Overcoming Political Instability
[[Future scenarios and strategic foresight | Strategic foresight scenarios]] can be influential even in politically unstable contexts. The "Morphle Scenarios" developed in South Africa during the end of apartheid are an example, presenting four contrasting future pictures that helped high-level decision-makers, including Nelson Mandela, reframe their choices for national reconciliation and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>. The key was that these scenarios were presented to senior decision-makers who were able to identify with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>.

### Beyond Technology: Multidisciplinary Innovation
Innovation is not solely about technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>. While technology influences human interaction and organizational systems, effective anticipation requires a human-centric or system-design perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. Conversely, societal needs and values can drive the demand for specific technological solutions. Technology should serve broader goals (e.g., seamless services in a smart city addressing inequality), rather than being an end in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

### Measurement and Evaluation
A core challenge for [[Role of strategic foresight and experimentation | anticipatory innovation]] is how to make decisions and take actions without immediate evidence of impact, requiring a different approach to measurement and evaluation than traditional public sector standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>.

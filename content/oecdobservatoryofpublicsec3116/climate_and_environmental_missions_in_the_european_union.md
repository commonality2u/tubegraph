The conference, "Government Beyond Recovery: Anticipation to Bold Missions," co-organized by the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), with support from the European Institute of Public Administration, highlighted the role of bold missions in addressing global challenges following the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These missions are seen as an opportunity to think about new approaches to prevent future global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The OPSI is actively working on both anticipatory and [[governance_and_implementation_of_innovation_missions | mission-oriented approaches]], having recently launched a Missions Action Lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The aim is to implement missions iteratively and in an agile manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## European Commission's Mission Approach

The European Commission's DG Research and Innovation has launched five missions with significant funding from the Horizon Europe program, potentially billions of Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. A key aspect of this approach is integrating these missions across the EU's broader policy agenda through a dedicated governance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

The European Commission's selection of these missions is expected to significantly influence European Union countries and member states, acting as a signal for important investment areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Key Missions Related to Climate and Environment

Of the five missions launched, four are directly related to climate and environmental goals, with targets set for 2030:
*   **Climate Resilient Europe Mission:** Aims to prepare Europe to deal with climate disruptions and accelerate the transition to a healthy and prosperous future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Mission Starfish (Restoring Our Oceans and Waters):** Focuses on cleaning marine and fresh waters and restoring degraded ecosystems and habitats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **100 Climate Neutral Cities:** Seeks to support, promote, and showcase 100 cities' systemic transformation towards [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate neutrality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Caring for Life in Soil (Caring for Soil):** Aims for at least 75% of soils in the EU to be healthy for food, people, nature, and climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   *(The fifth mission is "Conquering Cancer," targeting over 3 million lives saved, living longer and better by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.)*

### Development Process and Governance

The development of these missions took longer than initially anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The process benefited from:
*   **Foresight:** A "ground-up process of gathering evidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Mission Boards:** Expertise from distinguished groups reviewing evidence and engaging stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Citizen Engagement:** A novel approach of listening to citizens' wants and inputs gathered through dedicated participatory and dialogue techniques across the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This approach is intended to continue throughout the mission implementation period of 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

To ensure commitment and longevity beyond current political cycles, the Commission emphasized:
*   Strong, broad agreement across policy areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.
*   Connection with citizens to foster buy-in and ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   Defined decision points and an analytical framework for monitoring performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.
*   Demonstrating the potential to build investments from beyond the initial Horizon Europe program, extending funding into future framework programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.

Each mission developed an implementation plan, clearly indicating that funding extends beyond Horizon Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. The missions are subject to stringent reviews, including annual committee updates, a review in 2023 (part of original legislation), and an interim evaluation as part of Horizon Europe in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. The involvement of other partners also helps ensure the continuity of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.

The importance of youth involvement in these missions, particularly the four Green Deal missions (soil, climate, oceans, and cities), has been highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>. The European Solidarity Corps, a Commission-funded action supporting young people's involvement in community-based projects, is expected to develop a strong connection with these missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.

## Related Challenges and Approaches

A key challenge is preventing "mission washing," where existing activities are rebranded as missions without fundamental changes in delivery or innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:18">[01:16:18]</a>. The ability to adapt quickly to changing conditions is crucial for missions set today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:46">[01:48:46]</a>. Surveys indicate that climate challenges are considered the most uncertain and continuously influenced by change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:22">[02:28:22]</a>, followed by societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:38">[02:38:38]</a>.

For missions to be future-proof and adapt dynamically, flexible and agile practices are needed within governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. This includes periodic "stress testing" of missions to avoid lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. A robust governance model that allows for regular evaluation, international evaluation of progress, and the ability to stop or finance new initiatives and integrate new partners is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>. The "learning mindset" must be embedded in the partnership, acknowledging that future needs and partners may change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

[[crosssectoral_and_interdisciplinary_collaboration_for_climate_policy | Cross-sectoral and interdisciplinary collaboration]] is vital for addressing complex challenges like climate change. Integrating social science and humanities is crucial because implementing solutions requires moving the consumer side and public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>. Political leadership, financial leadership, and involvement from companies and NGOs are necessary for driving the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

The goal for the future is to create nations that are inspiring, secure, wealthy, prosperous, and fair for future generations, ultimately aiming to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a national strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>. This requires rethinking planning processes in government to be more participative and future-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.

[[anticipatory_innovation_and_its_importance | Anticipatory innovation]] empowers governments to take action oriented towards the future, fostering a proactive approach to societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This approach ensures that better services and policies contribute to improved lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## The Innovation Incubator Program

Public sector innovation serves as a key driver of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. To accelerate this, the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), in collaboration with the European Commission, established the Innovation Incubator Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This incubator supports countries in exploring more radical innovations and anticipating future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Denmark, Romania, and Portugal participated in its pilot phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The program provides participating countries with:
*   International expert advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Peer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Co-design elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

## Tools and Dissemination

### Portugal's Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit
Under the guidance of the incubator, Portugal developed the [[anticipatory_innovation_and_its_importance | Anticipatory Innovation]] Starter Kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This kit is designed for public service servants and managers who are new to [[anticipatory_innovation_and_its_importance | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Its purpose is to introduce the concept in an easy-to-understand, assess, and use manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Collaboration with Accelerate Estonia
Sharing experiences among innovators is crucial for mutual learning and disseminating positive contributions throughout the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. OPSI has partnered with Accelerate Estonia to help disseminate lessons learned from the Innovation Incubator experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Accelerate Estonia focuses on accelerating societal progress by identifying societal problems and transforming them into opportunities through public-private partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Together, OPSI and Accelerate Estonia have created tools for incubating innovation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. These tools are accessible to governments on OPSI's website and can be adapted to their unique contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Role of OPSI

OPSI serves as the global forum for [[anticipatory_innovation_in_public_sector | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. It supports governments in understanding, testing, and embedding new initiatives to respond to societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The development and application of the Innovation Playbook emphasize a strong commitment to [[feedback_and_iterative_improvement_process | feedback and iterative improvement]]. This approach is central to ensuring the tool remains relevant, actionable, and widely adopted by public servants globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:47">[04:47:47]</a>.

## Foundational Principles

The OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation, which the Playbook translates into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, includes key principles that underpin this iterative philosophy:
*   **Supporting Exploration, Iteration, and Testing**: This principle highlights the importance of testing before [[implementing_innovative_ideas | implementing]] ideas and learning from errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Innovation involves taking risks, which can be managed in controlled environments using robust methods for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Diffusing Lessons and Sharing Practices**: The Declaration asserts that innovation is shareable and built in partnership, rejecting monopolies of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Sharing experiences helps the community learn from others and [[continuous_improvement_and_organizational_resilience | improve activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## The Playbook's Iterative Journey

The Playbook itself was a solution co-created by diverse countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Its journey from concept to a digital version involved significant [[feedback_and_iterative_improvement_process | iterative improvement]]:
*   **Initial Mockup**: Twelve countries were initially engaged in co-creating a very simple mockup, originally a Word document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **First Iteration**: This was improved to include tools and cases, a suggestion that came directly from the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Final Version**: A consolidated version was tested, with participants providing feedback through sessions like the "World Jambo session" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Mechanisms for Feedback and Improvement

To ensure the Playbook is dynamic and user-centric, several mechanisms were put in place:
*   **User-Centric Design**: The creators actively engaged actual users in the co-creation and co-design of the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **[[experimentation_and_policy_prototyping | Experimentation]] and Adaptation**: The Playbook was tried, applied, and learnings were gathered during [[experimentation_and_policy_prototyping | experimentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. The tool is designed to be adaptable to different contexts of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Feedback Channel**: A dedicated feedback channel was created to allow users to share their experiences, learned lessons, difficulties, and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This feedback was critical in identifying potential areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Country-Specific Adaptations and Learnings

Several countries demonstrated the value of adaptation and iterative refinement:
*   **Sweden**: Jonas Gumbal from Vinnova, Sweden, highlighted that their ministry signing the Declaration provided legitimacy for innovation work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. As pioneers, Sweden was the first to translate the Playbook into Swedish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>, and they felt the urge to organize an in-person session, adapting the material to fit a physical workshop format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:57">[02:29:57]</a>. This was driven by insights from [[experimentation_and_policy_prototyping | prototyping]] with a Swedish target group, which revealed that the material needed to be in Swedish for wide use and that it was initially too extensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Key Learnings**: [[experimentation_and_policy_prototyping | Prototyping]] before widespread rollout was highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:43">[02:44:43]</a>. The Swedish case made it clear that there were still many things to improve in the Playbook and that continuous conversation was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Romania**: Anca Pesco and Larissa Balac from Romania's Innovation Lab translated the Playbook and used it as a critical tool to build their emerging community of innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Initially, Romania found the concept of public sector innovation quite new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>, but the Playbook helped them disseminate and concretize the Declaration's ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:05">[01:18:05]</a>.
    *   **Key Learnings**: The co-creation process itself was an [[experimentation_and_policy_prototyping | experiment]] that revealed shared challenges across countries, helping Romania to be more resilient in explaining innovation to those who didn't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. They copied the methodology of [[experimentation_and_policy_prototyping | experimenting]] and co-creating the Playbook for their own [[implementing_innovative_ideas | innovative activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:21">[04:44:21]</a>.
*   **Chile**: Orlando Huijse, Director of the Laboratorio de Gobierno in Chile, highlighted that the Declaration provides a common understanding of public innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Their agile consultancy service is based on [[experimentation_and_policy_prototyping | exploration, iteration, and testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Transition to a Digital, Living Platform

The decision to develop a new digital version of the Playbook was a direct response to accumulated experiences and identified areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:51">[04:47:51]</a>:
*   **Engagement and Playfulness**: Users requested an engaging, playful, and interactive version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:29">[04:48:29]</a>.
*   **Cross-Linkages**: There was a desire to make all existing resources accessible from a single point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:38">[04:48:38]</a>.
*   **Updatable and Manageable**: To avoid the Playbook becoming "fossilized" or a static file, it needed to be updatable and manageable without requiring new PDF versions for every change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:51">[04:48:51]</a>. This ensures it remains a "living creature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:22">[04:48:22]</a>.
*   **Accessibility**: The digital version ensures anytime, anywhere access for users, regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:06">[04:49:06]</a>.
*   **Automatic Reporting**: A key feature was the ability to automatically produce systematized and exportable results of user interactions with the Playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:20">[04:49:20]</a>.

> "We cannot let the Playbook to get fossilized, so we really don't want to create a file, so we really want to keep it a living creature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:16">[04:48:16]</a>

This digital transformation involved a working group from Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Luxembourg, Spain, and Sweden, who helped identify key features, pretest the structure, and define the user journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. The current demo version is a step towards a much more interactive and dynamic platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. The ongoing feedback from users, even on the rough demo, will be used to build the definitive version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:52">[05:59:52]</a>.

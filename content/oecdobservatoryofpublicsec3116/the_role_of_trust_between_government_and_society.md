The relationship between government and society, particularly concerning [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | citizen trust]], has been profoundly highlighted and tested during recent global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This period has underscored the vital role of the state and the need for strong public sector capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Trust as a Pivotal Element
A [[trust_and_power_in_citizengovernment_relationships | trusting relationship]] between people and their administration is pivotal when addressing societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. High trust correlates directly with better compliance and better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Studies from 233 regions in 19 European countries show that mobility related to non-essential activities was significantly lower in high-trust regions compared to low-trust regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

### Factors Influencing Trust
[[Building trust in public institutions | People's perception]] of a government's competence, integrity, openness, and fairness is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. The reliability and responsiveness of service delivery significantly influence people's trust in their governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

### The Challenge of Society's Willingness
One of the key lessons learned during the crisis is that "no government can go faster than society is willing to follow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. In Latvia, the initial, rapid reaction to the pandemic was successful because society cooperated extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. However, during a subsequent wave, it took longer to achieve a collective understanding between government and society, leading to a slower reaction time and more severe outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[citizen engagement and trust in uncertain times | bringing government and people together]], with trust acting as the "glue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

> "If people do not believe in what the government is telling them, if people actually in many cases believe that what the government is telling them is by definition not true, then of course it will be much more difficult to overcome a situation like the one we're facing now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

## Building and Maintaining Trust
The [[role_of_communication_and_transparency_in_building_trust | role of communication and transparency in building trust]] is paramount. Governments must continuously inform society on how to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This involves being more open and engaging directly with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

### Combatting Disinformation
Disinformation threatens the efficacy of policy measures, undermines trust, amplifies fears, and can lead to harmful behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Governments need to actively combat this by fostering openness and direct engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

### The Power of Digital Governance
One key strength for [[building_trust_through_effective_public_administration | building trust through effective public administration]] and efficiency in governance is digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>. This involves:
*   **e-government:** Providing as many electronic services as possible to citizens and businesses, making government available 24/7, 365 days a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
*   **Automation:** Utilizing artificial intelligence to automate repetitive tasks, such as issuing permits, which can significantly increase productivity and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.
*   **Reduced Corruption:** Cutting physical contact between civil servants and citizens through digital processes can help fight corruption by making processes more transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. For example, Serbia's fully electronic construction permitting process moved it into the top 10 countries globally for efficiency and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>.
*   **Environmental Benefits:** Digitalization also yields environmental benefits, such as saving paper, trees, water, and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

### Balancing Public Health and Individual Freedoms
The pandemic has dramatically changed perceptions of individual freedoms and civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. Governments face a complex challenge in balancing protecting people's health with safeguarding civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. This includes decisions on mandatory mask-wearing, social distancing rules, and tracking movements or social circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. This tension necessitates public debate and careful consideration of how governments should behave in such circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>.

## Lessons for Future Crises
To prepare for future crises, governments need to build a more flexible, anticipatory, and resilient state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This means a recovery that is green, sustainable, inclusive, and resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. Governments must learn from the current crisis to make decisions today that will shape the next 30-40 years, focusing on technology choices that impact the environment and policies that foster inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.

### Key Takeaways
*   **Speed and Collective Understanding:** Quick reaction time is crucial, but only effective when government and society react together in a collective understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Adaptability and Innovation:** Governments must be willing to work in different and more flexible ways, experimenting with new approaches and massively shifting to remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Communication is Key:** Continuously inform, inform, inform society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Digitalization:** Embracing digital transformation can enhance efficiency, transparency, and reduce corruption, while also contributing to climate change mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   **Addressing Inequalities:** The crisis has exacerbated underlying issues like inequalities and economic insecurity, which require urgent action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Multilateral Approach:** Global issues like pandemics require global approaches, international cooperation, and collaboration through multilateralism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

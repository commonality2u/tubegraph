The world is changing rapidly, and the future is quite unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. To navigate this future, it's essential to understand where disruptions originate and where the world is headed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Citizens, accustomed to excellent services from the private sector, expect public sector services to be customer-focused, efficient, [[public_sector_innovation | innovative]], personalized, and technology-enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The answer to providing such services lies in [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Driving Public Sector Innovation

Achieving excellent public services requires several key shifts:

*   **Agile and Adaptive Structures**
    *   Formalizing agile working practices, such as remote working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   Adopting flatter, team-based organizational structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   Organizations should be flexible to adapt to citizens' needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the public administration's ability to be agile and responsive, adapting quickly to new ways of working and communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Collaboration and Co-creation**
    *   Collaborating outside the government ecosystem is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   Cooperation and exchange of good practices with other governments globally are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   Co-creating services with citizens is crucial, promoting active citizenship and creating platforms for direct connection with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   Design methods and foresight can immerse and explore future stories, putting oneself in the shoes of future citizens or decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   Co-designing involves many decision-makers, experts, and citizens in exploring different futures and making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Building Essential Capabilities

To become truly dynamic and resilient, public organizations must cultivate specific capabilities:

*   **Strategic Workforce Planning**
    *   Recruiting civil servants who are [[innovation_skills_for_public_sector | innovative]] and collaborative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   Redesigning jobs and processes to enable greater efficiency and [[innovation in the public sector | innovative]] thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   Continuously upskilling and reskilling civil servants is crucial to keep pace with new technologies and complex societal problems, preventing skills from becoming obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Embracing Learning and Foresight**
    *   The ability to continuously learn and adapt is the most important skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    *   Public administration should become a learning organization, able to learn from the past and anticipate the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   Using foresight, scenarios, and future thinking allows putting ourselves into what might happen, being humble yet ambitious about the uncertain future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   Scouting for and detecting signals of change early, identifying emerging issues, and giving them names allows leaders and policymakers to engage and start important conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

## The Role of Ethics in Public Sector Innovation

[[Public sector innovation | Innovation in the public sector]] must be guided by a strong ethical compass:

*   **Responsible Use of Data and Technology**
    *   Using data and analytics for building evidence-based policymaking and finding [[public_sector_innovation | innovative]] solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   Technology can lead to highly centralized control and algorithmic governance, raising concerns about decision biases and the structure of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
    *   However, technology also enables hyper-personalization and distribution, allowing for localized, bottom-up service delivery and joint commons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.
*   **The "Karma of Government"**
    *   Governments must be ethical towards the future, not only considering current actions and effects but also their overall footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.
    *   The responsibility of government extends to dealing with the unequal effects of change, such as job displacement due to automatization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
    *   An emerging capability for public organizations is the "ethics of innovation," which involves civil servants thinking about their own ethics, biases, and bringing in diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
*   **Challenging Entrenched Futures**
    *   One deeply entrenched future to challenge is the opposition between government and the market, as all markets are co-created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. Governments should be more radical in rethinking what kind of capitalism they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>.
    *   Another entrenched future to debunk is the growth narrative focused on GDP, which has not adequately addressed climate emergency or inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.
    *   The paradigm of linearity, a technocentric belief in rationality that the future will always be a better progression, has eroded, with some generations now believing the future will be worse than the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>. This necessitates a collective imagination for a more inclusive, circular, and connected future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>.

## The Power of Diversity in Public Sector Innovation

Diversity is not just about representation, but about bringing varied perspectives to problem-solving and future-building:

*   **Empathy and Perspective-Taking**
    *   Exploring problems and leveraging empathy with citizens and their needs is a key principle of leading [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] through design thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
    *   In the future, bringing the "whole person" to work, not just the professional, is part of embracing self-management and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>.
    *   Immersing and creating empathy, a "lived experience" of the future through storytelling and scenarios, is crucial for challenging incompatible mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.
*   **Diversity of Thought and Analysis**
    *   New skills important for the future include critical thinking, creativity, [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], problem-solving, and anticipating future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   Building diversity into public sector organizations means having a diversity of analytical viewpoints, integrating ethnographic analysis alongside statistical and economic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>. This diversity helps adapt to a constantly changing future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.
    *   It is important that teams working on foresight are from diverse backgrounds, including those with and without policy-making experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.
*   **Demographic Shifts as Drivers**
    *   Recognizing and moving with the agenda of different generations (e.g., Generation X, Millennials, Generation COVID) can maximize change, acting as a "fair wind behind your sail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

The future of the public sector demands not just [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] but [[innovation in public sector | innovation]] that is consciously ethical and inclusive. This means moving beyond a stability-seeking, bureaucratic model towards dynamic organizations that are "dynamic by design" and thus "resilient by design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>. By continuously reframing problems, fostering openness and diverse analytical viewpoints, and embracing ethical [[challenges_in_public_sector_innovation | challenges]], governments can steer towards positive futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. The current "liquefaction moment," where solid structures turn to liquid, presents a unique opportunity to redesign and rebuild a more connected and equitable society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

The "Government Aftershock High-Level Forum" convened a global dialogue to discuss the crisis and its revelations about the role and expectations of government, both currently and in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The forum featured four distinguished panelists: Mr. Molina Rodriguez (Deputy Minister of National Planning and Economic Policy, Republic of Costa Rica), Jen Sutter (Director, Institute for Media and Journalism, Dublin City University, Ireland), Gary Gillespie (Chief Economist for the Government of Scotland), and Mauna Benara (Civil Society Innovation Lead, Civicus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The event, titled "Building Back Better Together and Reaffirming the Role of Citizen-Centered Governance," aimed to explore how governments intend to use this opportunity for transformation and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Imperative of Citizen Engagement

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly magnified the need for deep, quick, and paced engagement with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Citizens' engagement, understanding, and compliance are fundamental to effectively addressing a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Higher compliance, increased trust in governments, and greater availability of information contribute to public understanding and cohesiveness, driving citizen participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Initial Challenges and Lessons

*   **Urgency over Strategy**: The unprecedented nature of the pandemic meant that urgent responses often superseded strategic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:15">[0:11:15]</a>. Public services under stress revealed limitations in tailoring solutions for every citizen's expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:31">[0:05:31]</a>.
*   **Exclusion of Vulnerable Populations**: Traditional and digital engagement methods can exclude vulnerable populations, such as refugees, foreigners, low-income individuals, informal workers, and those without internet access or digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:19">[0:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:47:56">[0:47:56]</a>. Governments must address the question of "who are we leaving behind and how" to ensure inclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.
*   **Balancing Authority with Engagement**: While there has been increased citizen engagement, there has also been a range of restrictions on freedoms, including censorship, limits on access to information, and crackdowns on protests, undermining accountability and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:11">[0:15:11]</a>.

## [[Government innovation during COVID19 | Innovation and Adaptation in Governance]]

Governments have adapted by implementing various measures:
*   **Direct Engagement Measures**: Running weekly polls to gauge citizen understanding and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:41">[0:08:41]</a>. Daily press briefings led by senior officials to explain policies and impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:50">[0:08:50]</a>.
*   **Openness and Humility**: The Scottish government, guided by a National Performance Framework, prioritizes treating people with kindness, dignity, and compassion, and acting transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:22">[0:25:22]</a>. They embrace humility, acknowledging they don't have all the answers and need citizens to be part of the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:29">[0:27:29]</a>.
*   **Police Engagement**: In Scotland, policing during COVID-19 followed a "four E's" approach: engage, explain, encourage, and only if needed, enforce, embodying a citizen-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:00">[0:26:00]</a>.
*   **Technical Communication**: Policies have become technically complex, requiring governments to simplify information to ensure citizens understand and engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:18">[0:24:18]</a>.
*   **Digital Platforms**: The use of digital platforms like Zoom with breakout rooms and other tools has enabled engagement when face-to-face meetings are not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:30:45">[0:30:45]</a>. These platforms, however, must ensure equality of voice and prevent domination by "usual suspects" or vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:45:57">[0:45:57]</a>.

## The Crucial Role of Civil Society

Civil society groups demonstrated high agility in responding to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:34:35">[0:34:35]</a>. They were fast to respond, providing humanitarian emergency support and reaching vulnerable populations often overlooked by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:34:56">[0:34:56]</a>. Civil society acted as a safeguard against misinformation through innovative campaigns, awareness-raising, and creative expressions like graffiti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:35:36">[0:35:36]</a>. They also played a front-line role in accountability and transparency, monitoring aid distribution and demanding visibility on foreign funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:19">[0:36:19]</a>.

### Key Principles
*   **Prioritize Inclusion**: Future strategies must explicitly ask "who are we leaving behind?" and ensure mechanisms are in place to include the most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.
*   **Foster Radical Partnerships**: Moving beyond market-based client relationships, true partnerships and co-designing solutions with citizens and civil society are essential for sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:20:18">[0:20:18]</a>. This means involving vulnerable populations and being inclusive in approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:32:30">[0:32:30]</a>.
*   **Empower Citizens as Implementers**: Citizens want to be part of the implementation and monitoring of policies, particularly when public institutions are overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:41:06">[0:41:06]</a>. Providing clear information and frameworks enables them to contribute as workers, enterprises, and employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:41:21">[0:41:21]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Based Engagement**: Provide citizens with evidence before asking for their input, and then clearly explain how their feedback influenced decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:46:42">[0:46:42]</a>. This builds trust and prevents cynicism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:33:31">[0:33:31]</a>.
*   **Combat Misinformation**: Engaging citizens directly with experts, allowing them to ask questions, and then having citizens report back to their peers can be powerful in correcting misperceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:56:02">[0:56:02]</a>. Citizens can become part of the solution to the "infodemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:13:10">[0:13:10]</a>.
*   **Invest in Resilient Infrastructure**: Public investment should boost infrastructure that is useful in both crisis and ordinary conditions, such as household internet access, rather than just schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sector Collaboration**: Beyond government-philanthropy interfaces, deeper collaboration across public services is crucial. This involves bringing public agencies together to break silos and empower them to contribute to shared missions, like public health initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:53:07">[0:53:07]</a>.

### Poll Results on Citizen Engagement
A poll conducted during the forum revealed strong support for increased citizen engagement:
*   **Is there a need to engage with citizens more now than before the onset of COVID-19?**
    *   Yes: 89.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>
    *   No: 10.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>
*   **Has your government engaged with citizens in a collaborative way since the onset of COVID-19?**
    *   Yes, the government has made great efforts to involve citizens in COVID-19 discussions: 18.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>
    *   Yes, but in a limited way: 59.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>
    *   No, the government has not had an opportunity to engage with citizens in a collaborative way: 21.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>

The results were seen as encouraging, indicating that while only a minority of governments have engaged significantly, a large majority have started in some capacity, providing a strong foundation to build upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.

## Personal Commitments and Future Outlook

Panelists shared their commitments to future governance strategies:
*   **Mauna Benara (Civicus)**: To advocate for more radical civic space and fundamental freedoms, especially challenging restrictions that arose during the pandemic. She emphasizes that sustainability comes through inclusion and genuine partnership, moving beyond a "market approach" to citizen relations towards a "constituents relations" where people are seen as the source of legitimacy and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.
*   **Jen Sutter (Dublin City University)**: To ensure all her research is open access, making knowledge more widely available. She is committed to dedicating a significant portion of her time to "working in the real world" to help citizens, civil society, and governments protect democracies and bring people along, especially younger generations who are concerned about liberal democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>.
*   **Gary Gillespie (Government of Scotland)**: To focus on building the resilience of systems, societies, and communities to respond to future shocks more effectively. He aims to accelerate the existing changes in engagement, moving away from formal, siloed communication to more direct citizen interaction and co-production of solutions from the bottom up, with businesses and communities as key drivers of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.
*   **Mr. Molina Rodriguez (Costa Rica)**: To identify and address those left behind by current engagement mechanisms. He stressed that investment should boost means useful in both crisis and ordinary conditions (e.g., household internet access). His commitment is to revise routines to ensure effectiveness, leverage digital tools, and prioritize pilot experiences and ongoing adaptation for better citizen participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.

The pandemic has accelerated a rapid pace of change in how governments engage with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:43:05">[0:43:05]</a>. The consensus is that governments must not revert to pre-COVID, more formal methods of consultation that empower only certain groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:43:15">[0:43:15]</a>. The crisis has changed what citizens value, leading to questions about fairness and the impact of regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:43:36">[0:43:36]</a>. The role of the citizen is absolutely crucial for navigating future challenges, including the climate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:45:01">[0:45:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>.

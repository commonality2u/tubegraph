Personalized medicine, often referred to as precision medicine, is a crucial approach in modern healthcare, especially in the context of complex diseases like cancer. The adoption of a [[Missionoriented innovation | mission-oriented approach]] is vital for its successful implementation, involving new tools for [[implementation_of_health_policies | implementation]] and novel ways of collaborating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Why a Mission for Personalized Medicine in Cancer?

[[Cancer treatment and prevention | Cancer]] has emerged as the leading cause of death in Western Europe, and this problem is projected to worsen as societies age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The complexity of [[Cancer treatment and prevention | cancer]] involves numerous parties, necessitating a structured way for diverse stakeholders to collaborate effectively within a clear timeframe and towards a defined objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

A [[Missionoriented innovation | mission-oriented approach]] provides crucial directionality, addressing the limited scope and mandate of individual organizations that often result in sub-optimal outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Without a shared direction, efforts can be fragmented, leading to issues such as:
*   Precision [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer therapies]] that are too expensive for public healthcare due to a lack of sustainable reimbursement models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   Molecular diagnostics that are less accurate because policies prevent data sharing across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

The [[Missionoriented innovation | mission approach]] encourages uniting forces, establishing a common direction, and fostering a shared understanding and commitment among all involved parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. It integrates systemic aspects of innovation, including technology, infrastructure, [[behavioral_public_policy | behavior]], and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This comprehensive strategy acknowledges that no single actor can solve the complex challenges of personalized medicine in [[Cancer treatment and prevention | cancer]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

For a [[missionoriented_innovation | mission approach]] to succeed in health, particularly in [[Cancer treatment and prevention | cancer]], several conditions must be met:
*   Technological maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   Promise for continued scientific advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   Sufficient governance structures for health innovation and social systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   Complementary regulatory systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

[[Cancer treatment and prevention | Cancer]] is an area where these elements are largely present, requiring a focused push to make progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. However, it is crucial to recognize the heterogeneity within [[Cancer treatment and prevention | cancer]] as a policy area and to specifically define how the [[missionoriented_innovation | mission]] will be applied to different aspects of the [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | cancer challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Opportunities for Personalized Medicine

The greatest opportunities for personalized medicine lie in areas where multi-sectoral knowledge, experience, and decision-making power converge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. A shared [[Missionoriented innovation | mission]] simplifies collaboration, but it also demands co-ownership of actions and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This means collaborators must take responsibility in their respective fields of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

A significant opportunity exists in [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | lung cancer]] through enhanced prevention and earlier detection among both risk groups and never-smokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Achieving this requires collaboration not only among medical specialists and industry but also with behavioral sociologists and communication experts to address complex challenges together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

The European Commission aims to address fragmentation in research, healthcare, and education by focusing on research that improves outcomes for high-risk individuals and patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Key aspects of this focus include:
*   Covering the complete continuum of [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | prevention]] and therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   Emphasizing the need for robust infrastructure, starting with comprehensive [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer centers]] and their networks to ensure equitable access for all patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   Boosting funding for [[Cancer prevention and treatment strategies | prevention]], which currently receives only about 7% of typical [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer research]] budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   Recognizing the enormous potential of early detection for both [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | prevention]] and [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | treatment]] by enabling earlier intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   Deepening the understanding of biological questions, as expanding knowledge in [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer]] biology is crucial for both [[cancer_prevention_and_treatment_strategies | prevention]] and therapeutic research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   Improving collaboration to analyze histogenetic groups and their subgroups, acknowledging their diverse biological backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   Structuring clinical trials to be more complex and address the gap between innovation and [[implementation_of_health_policies | implementation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   Explicitly involving patients in clinical trials and in the development of comprehensive [[cancer_treatment_and_prevention | cancer centers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

Implementing [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] and [[anticipatory_innovation_and_strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | anticipatory innovation]] in public sectors presents numerous [[challenges_in_public_sector_innovation | challenges]]. These difficulties stem from the inherent nature of governance, organizational structures, and the unpredictable environment governments operate within.

## Understanding the Need for Anticipation
The world governments operate in is characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and novelty (VUCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Daily problems are complex, and new elements, whether technological or environmental, constantly emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Governments need to respond adequately and be prepared to define a desirable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This requires anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Key Challenges in Implementing Foresight

### Resistance to Challenging the Status Quo
A significant challenge is the ability to critically question the field or organization one works for, or to propose truly transformative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Public sector organizations, like private sector ones, face an "innovator's dilemma" where established practices become old and environmental conditions change, but challenging them is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

Key issues include:
*   **"Cassandra effects"**: People foresee change, but their warnings are not believed or acted upon within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Misleading Stakeholder Feedback**: Current stakeholders, accustomed to existing services, may not express a need for early-stage new ideas that initially underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Strategic Intent vs. Anticipation**: Leadership often focuses on immediate challenges, diverting attention from upcoming risks or opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Organizational Resistance**: Organizations are used to existing ways of performing and resist dramatic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Ignoring new transformations, however, is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### The Collingridge Dilemma
This dilemma highlights the difficulty in controlling technological developments. In early phases, there's more possibility to influence development, but less evidence of potential impacts. In later phases, evidence of impact is high, but the ability to control innovations diminishes significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Governments need to think about technological and non-technological changes early on to influence values and possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This requires a different approach to creating evidence and experimenting, rather than a "wait and see" position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

### Static Future Perspectives
Governments often view the future from a static perspective, using tools like the "futures cone" as a one-off exercise to input into a strategy, then leaving it to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. However, the future requires continuous practice for [[strategic_foresight_and_innovation_in_government | strategic foresight]] to be impactful in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

### The Impact Gap of Strategic Foresight
While [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] is crucial for providing input into anticipation, collecting signals, and integrating them into long-term objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>, there is an "impact gap" or "implementation gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Insights from [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] often get ignored due to:
*   Producing information that questions current practices and is undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
*   Lack of specific feeding into concrete actions or implementation mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.
*   Silos within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.
*   Governments' tendency to believe they control innovation and the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   The gap between foresight (foreseeing crises like global pandemics) and actual preparedness and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

### Organizational and Cultural Barriers
Surveys indicate that [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation_in_the_public_sector | challenges in implementing innovation in the public sector]] include:
*   Change fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
*   Lack of participatory approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   Need for changes in leadership and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.
*   Aversion to challenging assumptions and values, especially when the future might suggest current approaches are wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>.
*   Leadership's political risk and accountability for things going wrong when making decisions about uncertain futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
*   Biases, such as expert bias and "minimal squeak behavior" (ignoring problems until they become urgent and painful) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.
*   Linear thinking that desires certainty and presents officials as absolute experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.
*   Public pressure on leaders to "have the answers," which can be an unreasonable demand given uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>.

### Distinguishing Anticipatory Innovation from Other Concepts
While concepts like resilience and adaptive capacity are important for governments, they are not synonymous with anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.
*   **Resilience**: Aims to make systems more prepared for external shocks, allowing them to expand without breaking and uphold core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. However, it doesn't account for fundamental changes that require the system itself to transform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.
*   **Adaptive/Agile Capacity**: Involves tactical and adaptive responses to immediate crises, acting without extensive knowledge and rapidly testing and changing actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>. This differs from strategic, anticipatory thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.
*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation**: Driven by a single, agreed-upon purpose or goal (e.g., decarbonization by a specific date) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>. Anticipatory innovation, however, considers unexpected developments, alternative solutions, and the potential side effects or "rippling effects" of pursuing a mission, ensuring the system isn't "locked in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.

### Evidence and Measurement
Anticipatory innovation requires a different type of measurement and evaluation system than standard public sector approaches, as it involves making decisions and taking actions without immediate, traditional evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>.

## Building Anticipatory Innovation Governance Systems

To overcome these [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_public_sector_innovation | challenges and strategies in implementing public sector innovation]], a dedicated [[anticipatory_innovation_and_strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | anticipatory innovation governance]] system is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. This system supports critical and transformative ideas that challenge current paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

Key elements for building such a system include:
*   **Demand**: Leadership culture that demands [[strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | strategic foresight]] and [[anticipatory_innovation_and_strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
*   **Capacity**: Knowledge and skills (e.g., horizon scanners, scenario planners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   **Embeddedness**: Coordination of anticipatory activities with existing system elements like electoral cycles and policy reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. Implementation should be planned in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
*   **Institutions**: Dedicated teams and institutions responsible for [[anticipatory_innovation_and_strategic_foresight_in_public_policy | anticipatory innovation]], connected with wider decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.
*   **Feedback**: Systems to evaluate how foresight was used and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

Examples like Finland have well-developed [[role_of_foresight_in_policymaking | foresight in policymaking]] systems with multiple teams across ministries, a parliamentary committee, and a community engaging government, non-government, and academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>. The Swedish city of Helsingborg also consciously decided to become an anticipatory organization, building leadership capacity and establishing itself as a test bed for future-oriented projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.

Ultimately, building this capacity means understanding the roles needed, allowing autonomy for critical thinking teams, and establishing linkages within the organization to learn from practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>.

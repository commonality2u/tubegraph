The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly exacerbated the global crisis of gender-based violence (GBV), presenting governments with profound [[challenges_faced_by_governments_in_the_covid19_crisis | challenges]] and demanding more strategic and proactive responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Even before the pandemic, more than one-third of women were estimated to have experienced some form of violence in their lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The crisis highlighted and intensified existing weaknesses in government approaches to this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Exacerbation of Gender-Based Violence (GBV)

The pandemic has aggravated the GBV crisis worldwide, often referred to as a "shadow pandemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Reports from OECD and partner countries indicate a significant increase in GBV rates since the onset of COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, especially during lockdown periods when many women and girls were confined with their abusers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

Key exacerbating factors include:
*   **Confinement with abusers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, making it difficult, if not impossible, to know what is happening at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Increased pressure within families** due to factors like job loss and financial insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
*   Victims' fears of **bringing greater difficulties to their families** or **getting sick** if they seek help at counseling centers or shelters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   The perception among victims that domestic violence is **no longer a priority for authorities** or that support services are closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

## Core [[Challenges faced by governments]] in Addressing GBV During the Pandemic

Governments faced several [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]] and identified critical shortcomings in their response systems:

*   **Pre-existing Gaps**: Even before the pandemic, governments struggled with domestic violence and child abuse approaches, often lacking resources and efficient methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Oversight**: In the early stages of lockdowns, governments often focused on immediate measures like economic consequences, overlooking the specific needs and consequences for families and survivors of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact**: It was difficult to precisely measure the increase in GBV at the moment of onset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. While some countries like Chile saw a 250% increase in hotline calls during lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, others like Switzerland did not observe a general increase in police-reported cases, possibly due to semi-confinement or increased reporting due to awareness campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. This highlights the challenge of obtaining sound and reliable data quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Service Continuity and Accessibility**: A major [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenge]] was ensuring that essential services like counseling centers, shelters, and police interventions remained fully functional and accessible under new constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. The need to adapt to remote consultations and create alternative housing options for survivors became crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.
*   **Coordination and Cross-Government Approach**: The pandemic demonstrated that no single agency can tackle complex issues like GBV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>, necessitating a "whole of government" and even "whole of society" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. Challenges included coordinating between different service providers (police, shelters, counseling centers) and across different levels of government (national, local) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **Insufficient Prioritization and Resources**: A significant barrier was often insufficient political commitment and prioritization of GBV by governments, along with limited resources for service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>. Securing political will from the highest levels is indispensable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
*   **Legal and Policy Adaptation**: Existing laws and policies, such as curfew measures, sometimes inadvertently created barriers for survivors seeking help, highlighting the need for specific exceptions for victims of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.

## [[Challenges and responses during the COVID19 pandemic | Responses and Lessons Learned]]

Despite these [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]], many governments implemented [[innovative_government_responses_to_the_crisis | innovative government responses to the crisis]] and learned valuable lessons:

*   **Public Communication and Awareness**: Governments, often in collaboration with media and civil society, launched campaigns to inform the public that GBV services remained open and that fighting domestic violence was still a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. This included specific messaging about zero tolerance and exceptions for victims violating curfews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.
*   **Adapting Service Delivery**:
    *   **New Communication Channels**: Introduction of silent helplines, WhatsApp lines, online platforms for complaints, and partnerships with pharmacies for information dissemination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.
    *   **Remote Work**: Shifting to online consultations and remote appointments for day centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.
    *   **Capacity Expansion**: Increasing resources for hotlines, adding shifts, and expanding shelter capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.
    *   **Creative Solutions**: Developing "sidewalk conversations" or special meeting points for professionals to interact with survivors while respecting safety measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
*   **Inter-agency Coordination**: Establishing or activating multi-disciplinary task forces or coordination circuits involving police, justice, health, and social services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. These structures facilitated rapid adaptation and resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
*   **Policy and Legal Adjustments**: Declaring GBV-related services as essential and automatically extending restraining orders and protection measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.
*   **Data Collection and Evaluation**: Emphasizing the need for robust data collection to understand the situation of survivors, identify priority areas, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>.
*   **Survivor-Centric Approach**: A key lesson is the fundamental importance of listening to survivors and integrating their experiences into policy development and service design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. Services should be designed "for them and with them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

The [[pandemic_impact_on_government_practices | pandemic's impact on government practices]] demonstrated the critical need for governments to be flexible, creative, and proactive in addressing complex social issues, especially during times of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. The experience has allowed governments to identify bottlenecks, foster innovation, and strengthen a "whole of government" and "whole of society" approach to GBV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

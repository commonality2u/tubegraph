The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical role of [[public sector innovation]] and has spurred a significant surge in innovative activity across governments worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. The OECD's Observatory of [[Public Sector Innovation Introduction | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI), supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 program, has been tracking these responses to understand emerging trends and share lessons learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

### The Role of Innovation During Crisis
The crisis has underscored the need for more innovative and agile government, emphasizing a deliberate, mission-oriented, and systemic approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. It has also highlighted the importance of public governance, necessitating an approach that considers short-term, medium-term, and long-term responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

A crisis can be conducive to [[innovation in the public sector | public sector innovation]] because it creates clarity that change is necessary and removes the bias towards existing solutions, which are often found to be inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. New ways of working are invested in and supported, and unusual actions become perfectly normal, sometimes even expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. However, innovation during a crisis can also be challenging due to centralized decision-making that may be far from frontline realities, and non-COVID-related innovation work often takes a backseat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

The crisis has increased the legitimacy of [[public sector innovation]], showing that it is a necessity, not a luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. It has also revealed the existence of a real [[innovation in public sector | innovation ecosystem]] with latent connections between stakeholders, demonstrating the value of collaboration and crowdsourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

### Types of Innovation Observed

OPSI has identified over 250 examples of innovative responses, categorized by its Innovation Facets Model:

*   **Adaptive Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>: Adjusting to the new context.
    *   **Digital Transformation:** Widespread shift to online services and remote work, including virtual weddings and distant wedding registrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. Legislatures have adapted by meeting virtually to maintain oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. Denmark, with high pre-existing digital literacy, experienced a "quantum leap" in digital transformation, scaling existing infrastructure for remote work and digital citizen interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>. Libraries are exploring "library in the cloud" models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a>. Social workers in Denmark are using platforms like Signal and Teams for client contact, recognizing that young people may not use email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>: Bolstering existing suppliers or leveraging existing solutions.
    *   **Resource Redeployment:** Sweden redeployed airline stewards to health training to support the health network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. South Africa repurposed existing TB testing machines for COVID-19 diagnostics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:00">[29:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>.
*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>: Using the crisis as justification to accelerate broader objectives, such as Milan and Paris using it to remove traffic from key city areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>: Preparedness, often harder to notice if successful. Countries affected by SARS previously may have been better prepared for COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

### Country-Specific Examples

#### Portugal
Portugal's response has involved a three-fold [[public sector innovation and collaboration | innovation approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>:
1.  **Inside-out (State-led)**: Creation of a single point of contact, "we are on it," a hub/portal (ePortugal) providing reliable, up-to-date information on legal initiatives, public services, and direct access to digital services and support packages for citizens and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.
2.  **Outside-in (Civil Society)**: The "Tech for COVID-19" platform, a community of over 5,000 professionals, developed solutions like online consultation video channels and platforms to help local commerce sell online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Within (State internal)**: A collaborative work plan for public administration involving 22 projects by 27 public entities and civil society organizations, producing a leadership guide for crisis times, promoting innovation through an innovation barometer, and disseminating information strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>.

Challenges for Portugal include managing misinformation, coordinating numerous atomized initiatives, and addressing issues arising from virtualization, such as loneliness from remote work and ensuring digital inclusion for the 20% of the population without internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:55:00">[45:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:49:00">[46:49:00]</a>.

#### Denmark
Denmark's relatively mild crisis has allowed for different types of innovations:
*   **Communication:** The Prime Minister held press conferences for children, and the government used influencers to reach diverse audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:00">[22:43:00]</a>.
*   **Technology Implementation:** Rapid implementation of video consultations with GPs and chatbots for COVID-19 questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>.
*   **Local Solutions:** Municipalities developed local e-commerce platforms to help local shops without online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>.
*   **Collaboration:** Companies and volunteers used 3D printing to create face shields, and there was unprecedented collaboration within the health system across regional (hospitals) and municipal (at-home care) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a>.

#### South Africa
South Africa's response highlighted context-specific reactions and leveraging existing expertise:
*   **Context-Specific Solutions:** Rwanda rapidly rolled out handwashing facilities at public transport hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a>. Ghana repurposed its Zipline drone vaccine delivery system to deliver test kits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>.
*   **Repurposing Existing Capacity:** Existing screening programs for HIV, TB, malaria, and Ebola were adapted, and community health workers were trained and deployed for COVID-19 screening and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:45:00">[29:45:00]</a>.
*   **Public Communication:** The "listen to the doctors" and "listen to the experts" hashtag campaigns and daily sharing of videos from experts aimed to build trust and share technical details behind decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>.

### Managing Innovation Across Timeframes

Governments must operate across immediate, recovery, and long-term timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:37:00">[51:37:00]</a>. The crisis has shown that normal planning processes are insufficient, prompting a scenario-based approach to build future public services and economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:19:00">[52:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:00:00">[53:00:00]</a>. It has also led to a re-evaluation of services, like healthcare, removing previous tensions between public and private sectors and allowing for a rethinking of national health strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:16:00">[53:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:41:00">[53:41:00]</a>.

To sustain [[public sector innovation]] post-crisis, it's crucial to seize the current moment for discussion and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. Leaders need to involve users through design thinking and highlight "cracks in the old normal" to showcase new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>. Public servants have gained intense training in innovation, becoming more capable and willing to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>.

Key actions for the future include:
*   **Evidence-based decision-making:** Systematizing and analyzing vast amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>.
*   **Reinvestment in the [[public sector innovation | innovation ecosystem]]:** Maintaining bidirectional collaboration with external stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.
*   **Focus on sustainability and use:** Ensuring innovations are adopted and continue to deliver value, not just exist as outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.
*   **Responsible innovation:** Anticipating consequences and using foresight methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.
*   **Experimentation:** Embracing testing, learning from failure, and iterative improvement to reduce risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

The crisis serves as a laboratory and a catalyst for a paradigm shift in public administration, accelerating changes that were already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. It has shown the extraordinary adaptive capacity of public administration and highlighted the importance of a participatory state, where collaboration becomes the "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a>.

### Conclusion
The experience with COVID-19 has profoundly emphasized that [[public sector innovation]] is not a luxury but a necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. It has revealed the resilience and adaptability of public servants and the value of collaborative ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a>. The challenge now is to balance the desire to return to old norms with the opportunities for radical change, ensuring that lessons learned translate into sustained systemic improvements for future challenges, such as climate change and demographic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>. The call is for "less innovation theater... and more dirty hands," meaning practical, hands-on application of innovation to solve real problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>.

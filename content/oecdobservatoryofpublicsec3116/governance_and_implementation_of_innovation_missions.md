Innovation missions are emerging as a significant approach for addressing complex societal challenges globally. This approach involves a coordinated effort across various sectors and actors, but its successful implementation hinges on effective governance structures and practical strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Defining Mission-Oriented Innovation Policy

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines mission-oriented innovation policy as a coordinated package of policy and regulatory measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. These measures are specifically tailored to mobilize science, technology, and innovation, and beyond, to address societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This package spans several stages of the innovation cycle, utilizes diverse policy instruments (supply-side, demand-side, regulatory, top-down, bottom-up), and crosses different policy fields, sectors, and disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The ultimate aim is to achieve ambitious, bold, and concrete measurable goals within a defined timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Key Dimensions and Challenges

The OECD identifies three main dimensions of [[mission_oriented_innovation_in_public_sector | mission-oriented innovation]]: strategic orientation, policy coordination, and policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Each dimension presents specific challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Strategic Orientation
The primary challenge in strategic orientation is creating a broad consensus on selected societal challenges and translating them into clear, bold objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This requires customizing missions for specific situations, considering their scope, depth, granularity, focus, and boldness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It also involves securing and balancing the involvement of diverse stakeholders, including politicians, experts, and policymakers, while avoiding "mission inflation" or dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Policy Coordination
Policy coordination focuses on how to coordinate public and private actors across disciplinary, sectoral, and policy silos to work towards commonly agreed missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Challenges include engaging policy bodies beyond the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) area, such as sectoral ministries and regulatory bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, and coordinating actors across different levels of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Setting up an effective governance structure can be complex, as illustrated by the Netherlands' mission-driven top sectors model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Policy Implementation
Implementation is crucial; a mission is not merely a strategy or roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Key challenges involve connecting supply-side and demand-side instruments in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, managing solution portfolios while remaining "solution-neutral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, and effectively monitoring and evaluating these systemic policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Challenges in Low and Middle-Income Countries
[[role_of_international_organizations_in_innovation_missions | International organizations]] note additional complexities for low- and middle-income countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>:
*   **Localization and Ownership**: Ensuring missions are localized and genuinely owned by national actors, rather than being externally driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Capability and Capacity**: Missions must reflect the capabilities and capacities of the national innovation ecosystem, often requiring integral technology transfer models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
*   **Existing Coordination Mechanisms**: Assessing whether existing international development and humanitarian coordination systems are fit for purpose for cross-sectoral work, avoiding "morphic mimicry" without deep institutional transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **"Projectification"**: Overcoming the tendency to treat long-term, complex challenges as short-term projects, which hinders securing long-term commitment from international partners due to changing priorities or "development fads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Investment in Competing Solutions**: Traditional project funding often goes with a single implementation path, whereas [[mission_oriented_innovation_in_public_sector | mission-oriented innovation]] benefits from investing in competing solutions to drive systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

## Opportunities and the OECD Mission Action Lab

Despite the challenges, [[impact_and_strategic_orientation_of_innovation_missions | mission-oriented innovation policies]] offer a tailored space for collective action that adapts to specific contexts and institutional settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. They facilitate the co-creation of objectives, the establishment of specific governance structures, and the design and implementation of intentional policy mixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This systemic approach is best developed gradually through experimentation and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

The OECD's cross-directorate "Mission Action Lab" aims to address these challenges by supporting the practical implementation of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. The lab will focus on operationalizing missions and preventing them from becoming mere concepts that fail to realize their potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. Its activities include:
*   **Capacity Building**: Running simulations, boot camps, and providing support for setting missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Systemic Review**: Conducting reviews of everything related to missions, with a focus on governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.
*   **Demonstration Cases**: Selecting three to four demonstration cases across diverse mission areas, types, and countries to work on delivery and test new ways of coordinating and governing missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
*   **Community and Knowledge Sharing**: Fostering a community to share knowledge and experiences from OECD countries and low- and middle-income countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

## Practical Implementation Experiences

Experiences from various countries highlight common and unique implementation challenges:

### Australia (CSIRO)
CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, defines its missions as coordinated packages of projects mobilizing science, technology, and innovation to address well-defined societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. Unlike some European models, CSIRO's approach does not rely on a central pool of government funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. Instead, it aims to "crowd in" existing financial and other resources from industry, government, research, and civil society stakeholders to scale missions and achieve impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

Key challenges for CSIRO include:
*   **Scaling Up**: Moving from the launch phase to sustained, long-term implementation over five to seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Monitoring and Evaluation**: Establishing clear signposts, incentives, and intervention points to ensure programs deliver intended outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.
*   **Defining Interventions**: Deciding when an activity should be integrated into a mission framework or pursued as an alternative pathway (e.g., spin-out company or normal research) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

### Norway (Research Council of Norway - RCN)
Norway's Pilot-E scheme is an example of a successful bottom-up, inter-agency initiative that links different tools and schemes to accelerate the development of technologies, such as electric ferries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

Challenges in scaling up [[missions_and_public_sector_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] in Norway include:
*   **Cultural and Formal Issues**: As initiatives scale up and involve more agencies, different organizational cultures, ways of working, and even minor legal issues (e.g., publicizing applicant lists) can become hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.
*   **Political Involvement**: When ministries and politicians become involved, prestige issues can complicate collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.
*   **National vs. International Missions**: The need to connect national missions with broader European or global initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:51">[01:08:51]</a>.
*   **Whole-of-Government Approach**: Transforming industrial structures, such as moving away from oil and gas dependency, requires a comprehensive whole-of-government approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

### Vietnam (UNDP Accelerator Lab)
The UNDP in Vietnam is grappling with transitioning to a circular economy, focusing on plastic waste management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>. They employ a "deep demonstration" approach grounded in the notion that complex challenges cannot be solved with single-point or short-term solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

Key challenges and strategies for UNDP Vietnam include:
*   **Leveraging Existing Resources**: Utilizing "portfolio sense-making" to learn rapidly from current projects and identify acceleration opportunities, rather than designing interventions from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>.
*   **Coordination and Learning**: Moving beyond basic coordination to effective learning between various actors (businesses, NGOs, citizens, different government departments) and translating that learning into action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.
*   **Cross-Ministerial Alignment**: Bringing different government departments and ministries together around a shared mission, despite existing silos and incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>.
*   **Creating a Movement**: Underestimating the need to build a movement and foster necessary awareness and buy-in for initiatives like circular economy transitions at the city level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Portfolios**: Designing portfolios that can adapt to unexpected learnings and pivot strategies during implementation, which challenges traditional project funding models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.
*   **Reframing the Challenge**: Shifting the perception of circular economy from purely an environmental issue to an economic imperative for "future-proofing" and building resilience against future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:23">[01:26:23]</a>, learning from rapid, silo-breaking responses to crises like COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>.

### Denmark (Innovation Fund Denmark)
Denmark's first mission-driven program, managed by the Innovation Fund Denmark, focuses on green research strategy across four missions (e.g., PTX, carbon capture, agriculture, circular economy, plastic/textiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. The government allocated 700 million DKK (approx. 100 million EUR) for this initiative in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.

Challenges faced in Denmark include:
*   **Measuring Impact**: Difficulty in measuring and comparing the impact of different roadmaps, especially when objectives include both greenhouse gas reduction and competitiveness for Danish companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Involvement**: Battling between stakeholders, especially researchers, vying for funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
*   **Agility vs. Focus**: Balancing the need to stay focused on the roadmap with the agility to adapt to changing circumstances and allow new partners to join or disinvest from projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>.
*   **Industry Incentives**: Incentivizing greater involvement from companies, as the allocated funds are insufficient to solve all mission problems alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.
*   **Integrating Policies**: Combining science policy with demand-side policies, consumer behavior, and regulatory measures to ensure technology ideas lead to real-world solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>.

The "implementation is where good ideas go to die" sentiment reflects the critical need for effective governance and practical application in [[government_innovation_strategies | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Addressing these challenges is vital to unlocking the full potential of innovation missions to tackle complex societal problems. The [[role_and_development_of_innovation_tools_for_government | OECD Mission Action Lab]] aims to provide support and gather insights to help policy makers navigate these intricate aspects of [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | governance innovation]] and ensure [[impact_of_mission_oriented_innovation_on_society | mission-oriented innovation has a tangible impact]].

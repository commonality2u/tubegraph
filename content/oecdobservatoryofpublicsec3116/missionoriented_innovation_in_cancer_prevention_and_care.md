A workshop on [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] for [[precision_medicine_for_cancer | personalized medicine]] to optimize cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment was jointly hosted by Vision Zero Cancer and the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This two-day program aimed to explore how a missions approach can support cancer prevention and care in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Urgency of Cancer

Cancer remains a major global challenge. In 2020, 2.7 million people in Europe were diagnosed with cancer, and 1.3 million lost their lives to the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The problem is even larger worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Addressing this issue requires collective action and a purpose-driven, impactful approach, such as [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Understanding [[mission_oriented_innovation | Mission-Oriented Innovation]]

[[mission_oriented_innovation | Missions]] are defined as purpose-driven, ambitious tasks and outcomes that require collective commitment to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. They aim to solve significant problems rather than just improve existing ones, necessitating collective innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

The OECD defines [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] as a coordinated package of initiatives—including policy, regulatory, and collective actions like platforms and networks—specifically tailored to mobilize science, technology, innovation, and beyond, to address a societal challenge in a precise way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.

Key requirements for [[mission_oriented_innovation | missions]] include:
*   **Ambitious and Concrete Goals** to be met within a defined timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Spanning Multiple Innovation Stages** from research to demonstration, clinical trials, and market launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   **Crossing Various Silos** (disciplinary, sectoral, policy) between ministries, agencies, and communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>.
*   **Utilizing Diverse Support Instruments**, balancing supply-side and demand-side approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

The uniqueness of [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] lies in the integrated and tailored approach of these elements to achieve a specific mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

### Evolution of Mission-Oriented Policies
Historians trace the evolution of [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented policies]] through different generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>:
1.  **Developmental State:** Focused on nations catching up in manufacturing and industry, building resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>.
2.  **National Pride (Post-WWII R&D):** Characterized by competition between nations and large investments in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>.
3.  **Societal Experimental Missions:** The current generation, focusing on broader societal challenges and transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.

The underlying question is whether "rocket science" serves as the right blueprint for solving societal challenges, as it may not fully capture the political economy of [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.

## [[cancer_collaborative_initiatives | Collaborative Initiatives]] in Cancer Prevention and Care

*   **Approach:** Missions are seen as a vehicle to grow a movement, starting with political decisions and engaging partners, but ultimately driven by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:54">[02:19:54]</a>.
*   **Key Learnings:**
    *   Operating under conditions of *amplitude uncertainty*, requiring constant storytelling to internal and external stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>.
    *   Balancing short-term delivery with the long-term, inspirational challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:32">[02:22:32]</a>.
    *   The role of missions continuously evolves, impacting existing strategies and breaking down silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:50">[02:22:50]</a>.
    *   The necessity of *vulnerability* to listen, deliberate, and accept criticism from citizens to improve services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a>.
    *   Creating enabling infrastructure, such as bottom-up funding for resident-led initiatives, and rethinking decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:13">[02:24:13]</a>.
    *   The importance of *language*: communicating missions in an inclusive and encouraging way that doesn't sound like "another strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:20">[02:25:20]</a>.

## [[mission_oriented_innovation_challenges_and_implementation | Challenges and Opportunities]]

Human behavior is a core target for governments addressing environmental threats, and it is understood to be part of the solution for almost any public governance measure linked to climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 recognized the important role of sustainable lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Sustainability has been a top policy area for behavioral scientists over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Behavioral Science in Green Governance

Deep and broad transformations are needed in public governance systems to implement urgent green policy measures and advance towards a net-zero carbon future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Behavioral science is moving from systemic behavioral solutions to systemic change to empower public governance systems to lead the way with a new choice architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, where information, regulation, and financial incentives facilitate green habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Past Applications and Achievements

Behavioral science has yielded successful examples in several domains:
*   **Energy Consumption**
    *   **Feedback interventions** to reduce energy consumption, such as Opower, which started with studies in the 1990s comparing individual energy use to neighbors' consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These interventions typically result in 2% to 6% energy reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Opower has evolved to use sophisticated comparisons, such as "people like you," by considering factors like family size, climate, and house type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   **Home Power Savings Program** in New South Wales, Australia, aimed to reduce energy consumption in low-income households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Initial savings came from installing efficient appliances, but behavioral interventions, including intensive behavior change training for assessors, led to an additional 4% to 5% energy efficiency increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Key strategies included limiting choice (reducing six pages of options to four or five choices) and using public commitment devices (writing down chosen actions and sticking them on the fridge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Product Leveling**
    *   Better labeling of products has been used to encourage sustainable spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Information Comprehension**
    *   Controlled experiments have been successful in improving the comprehension and processing of information, such as different ways of presenting time-of-use tariffs for smart meter rollouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Counter-intuitive findings, like tables outperforming clocks for tariff understanding, highlight the importance of pre-testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Limitations and Challenges

*   **Late Integration**: Behavioral science has mainly been used to improve policies already implemented, rather than informing early policy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. It needs to be used earlier in the policy process, when environmental policies are being designed, taxes and regulations discussed, and [[strategies_for_stakeholder_engagement_in_public_administration | stakeholders are being consulted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Small Effect Sizes**: While successful, some nudges like social norms often yield relatively small effect sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Awareness is Not Enough**: Interventions that merely increase inquiries (e.g., about heat pumps) without leading to actual behavior change (installations) highlight that awareness alone is insufficient; it is only halfway through behavioral change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
*   **Over-reliance on Incentives/Data**:
    *   The assumption that financial incentives alone will drive energy reduction because "people aren't rational" often fails; financial incentives need to be significantly higher to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.
    *   Universal rollout of digital energy meters with the assumption that people will access data and become "energy zealots" has largely failed, with few accessing data and even fewer changing behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.
*   **Political Context**: Policies like carbon taxes can be highly politicized, making their implementation difficult regardless of their market-based effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.
*   **Ethical Concerns**: Customer segmentation and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) can raise ethical questions about fairness (giving something to some people but not others), requiring careful consideration of public perception and equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

### Promising Pathways and Future Directions

*   **Behavior Change as a System Diagnostic**: Using behavioral science to understand *why* people do not change (e.g., the 80% who don't change behavior after an intervention) can provide clues about systemic drivers or structures that prevent desired behavior, informing governments on other tools beyond incentives or persuasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Garnering Policy Support**:
    *   Behavioral science can "soften the audience" or encourage policy support *ahead* of implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Research suggests that people performing pro-environmental behaviors are more likely to support related policies (e.g., wind power) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   Leveraging "spillover" (one behavior leading to another, and ultimately to policy support) can be a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
    *   Fostering a collective identity (e.g., "we are a society good at saving energy") can increase the likelihood of individuals supporting the next behavioral step or policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.
*   **Providing New Tools and Early Insights**:
    *   Behavioral science can help design demand generation programs for new technologies, such as heat pumps and electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
    *   Moving beyond single "nudges" to **multi-pronged interventions** that tackle all barriers simultaneously (e.g., letters, community events, financial incentives, reducing "hassle factor" by involving contractors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. The "Solarize programs" in the US, which are community group buying schemes for solar panels, serve as inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
    *   Using **Behavioral Insights Paper Series** (literature reviews focused on policy problems, like installing heat pumps) can help policymakers understand barriers and drivers across the entire problem and prioritize future research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **"Nudge Plus" and [[citizen_participation_in_the_green_transition | Citizen Participation]]**: Beyond simple nudges, a general approach to behavioral thinking includes:
    *   **Testing things empirically** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
    *   Acknowledging humans are not "econs" (purely rational actors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.
    *   Systematically involving citizens from the beginning, as they are "experts of everyday life" who know the real problems and barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>. This also helps endorse changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>.
*   **Systemic Changes and Defaults**:
    *   Implementing "green defaults" in all policies, procurement, and schools can significantly change mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>. People learn from doing and trying things out, which is a quicker way to change values and crucial given time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.
    *   Examples like the "climate bonus" in Germany, paying households at the beginning of the year, can increase acceptance of carbon taxes by making the financial give-back clear and well-timed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>.
*   **Reducing Sludge**: Making desired behaviors easier by reducing friction costs and bureaucratic "sludge" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. This applies to both private households (e.g., simplifying the process of switching to greener heating technology) and decision-makers in companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>. [[innovative_approaches_to_public_governance | Sludge assessments]] can be a productive way to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Applying to Organizational Behavior**: Individual models of behavior can effectively explain and predict the behavior of organizations. Businesses respond to demand and pressure, meaning normative influences (e.g., rivals adopting green policies) and customer pressure (e.g., opting for greener products) are strong drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.

## Broader Applications and Context

Behavioral science is relevant everywhere, from energy to consumption of goods, water saving, mobility, compliance with regulation, agriculture, waste management, food intake, and food waste reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

*   **Water Conservation**: During significant droughts, public mood can drive an appetite for behavior change in water consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.
*   **[[Mission governance in climate policy | Climate Change]]**: Beyond energy use, climate change remains a particularly topical area for behavioral science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.
*   **[[Biodiversity]]**: With major reports highlighting biodiversity loss, there will be an appetite for policies that behavioral science can influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. An example is Victoria's "Value in Nature" plan, which included goals for every resident to connect with and act for nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.
*   **Waste Management**: The China Sword policy, which reduced tolerance for contamination in recyclables, created a window for behavioral intervention in waste management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. Addressing food waste is another active area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

### Policy Acceptance and Co-design

*   **Transparency**: Governments should be transparent and straightforward in their communication, avoiding trickery or manipulation, especially regarding financial implications like taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>.
*   **Good Governance**: Behavioral approaches should complement, not replace, "harder" regulation and financial incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. This includes smart regulation to stimulate innovation (e.g., sandbox regulation for experiments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.
*   **[[strategies_for_stakeholder_engagement in public administration | Co-design and Collaboration]]**:
    *   Integrating disciplines like human-centered design and even architecture can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
    *   **Citizen juries and panels** can be used effectively to adjudicate policy questions, come up with solutions, and garner support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.

## Call to Action for Policymakers

Policymakers should:
*   **Embed behavioral insights into the policy process**: Make it a standard step, like conducting a cost-benefit analysis, rather than an ad hoc "nice to have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. Tools are being developed, such as a toolkit by the International Energy Agency's behavioral insights platform, to help policymakers understand the key behavioral assumptions behind different policy approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. This aligns with broader [[government_innovation_strategies | government innovation strategies]] and [[innovation_strategies_for_governments | innovation strategies for governments]]
*   **Implement Green Defaults**: Leverage the power of defaults in all policies, from procurement to school practices, as they can lead to relatively large changes across large audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Behaviors with High Impact**: Focus efforts on specific behaviors that yield significant environmental benefits and are feasible to change. The example of Townsville, Australia, where the city rallied around encouraging residents to paint their roofs white (a behavior that significantly reduces energy consumption and has visible impact), illustrates how a focused, multi-faceted approach involving subsidies, supply chain engagement, and public communication can lead to widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>.

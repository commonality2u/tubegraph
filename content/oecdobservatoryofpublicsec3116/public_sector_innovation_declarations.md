[[Public Sector Innovation Declarations]] are documents, often non-binding, created by governments or international organizations to signal the importance of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and provide guidelines for its implementation within public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. They aim to foster a common understanding and approach to [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] across different levels of government and among public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

## Case Study: Canada's Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]]

### Origin and Context
Canada's Declaration on [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] was established in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Its development began in 2015 when the heads of all public services across Canada's federated model of governance (federal, provincial, and territorial) began discussing the renewal of the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. These discussions focused on how the vast public service enterprise could keep pace with external changes, transform itself, and remain relevant to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Common challenges identified included the use of data, digital technologies, and citizen engagement for co-creation of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Purpose and Content
The declaration is non-binding but serves to send a signal across all public service systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. It codified high-level, aspirational statements about new partnerships, data, technology, and funding models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The core idea was to penetrate all layers of the public service (approximately 250,000 federal employees and 700,000 provincial employees) to ensure leaders' support for new and transformative ideas would resonate widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Usage and Impact
Signed in November 2017 by all heads of public services (a historical first) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, the declaration has been used as a signpost to empower decision-makers and agencies to pursue innovative approaches for better policies and programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. It also facilitates more meaningful engagement with provincial and territorial colleagues, encouraging joint efforts to de-risk new ideas and foster bolder approaches through shared responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Reactions
The declaration was generally well-received in some circles and acknowledged in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. While it has helped advance the idea of moving new ideas from "side of desk" to "center of desk," the speaker notes that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and experimentation are still in their infancy or adolescent phase in Canada, and a full paradigm shift is not yet complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. There was no specific negative backlash to the document itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

## Case Study: France's Manifesto for [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]]

### Origin and Context
France's Manifesto for [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] was released in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. It emerged from a growing interest in [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] within French administration around 2016, exemplified by the creation of a new generation of public labs across regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. There was an expectation to define [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] within the French context and provide guidelines for new public servants exploring concepts like labs, design, and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Purpose and Content
The manifesto aimed to explain and argue that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] can yield serious results if approached correctly, not merely as a "fashion" or a superficial event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. It frames [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] as a new approach to public policymaking with the potential for significant impact on government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. The six-page document serves as a common reference text and official national guidelines to promote [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### Usage and Impact
The manifesto provided a common reference text for public servants, offering a basis and legitimacy for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. It helped public sector innovators (who were discovering or delivering early projects in design, experimentation, or behavioral sciences) demonstrate that their activities were serious and could have an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. It became a main tool in developing a community of public innovators, which grew to 600-700 people, providing them with a shared vision, values, examples, principles, and common challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. The ultimate goal is to change the culture of French public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### Reactions
While there were initial difficulties getting the manifesto endorsed by leadership, it was eventually approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Challenges remain, including hostility or a lack of seriousness from some in top administration who don't understand or resist different ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. The manifesto, while providing political support, is not seen as a "magical" solution to fully transform administration, indicating ongoing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

## OECD's Draft Declaration on [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | Public Sector Innovation]]

### Purpose and Underpinnings
The OECD's draft declaration aims to bring countries together, signify the importance of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], and establish a common agreement at the international level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. It is heavily based on the OECD's work with and learning from various countries, including a detailed system study with the Public Service of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

The declaration acknowledges that while [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] has always occurred in government, the current rate doesn't always match the need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. The goal is to embed [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] as a more systemic activity by fostering a more sophisticated and accessible conversation around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

### Key Concepts and Aims
The OECD declaration unpacks the multifaceted nature of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] by introducing "[[types_of_public_sector_innovation | innovation facets]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>:
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation**: Improving existing processes and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented innovation**: Achieving ambitious, large-scale goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation**: Responding to a changing external environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation**: Engaging with "weak signals" early to shape change rather than just react to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

Governments are encouraged to maintain a "portfolio" approach across these facets to hedge bets and be ready for unpredictable challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. The declaration aims to codify this language, tell a richer story about why [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] matters, why governments support it, and how all public servants (as innovators, recipients, or supporters) play a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. It emphasizes learning and sharing as [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is a continually evolving practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

## [[Public Consultation Process for Innovation Declarations | Public Consultation Process]]

The OECD launched a [[public_consultation_process_for_innovation_declarations | public consultation process]] for its draft declaration in November of the previous year, concluding on February 22nd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. Individuals, organizations, groups, or countries can submit feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

### Desired Feedback
The OECD seeks "genuine feedback" to iterate and strengthen the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. Specific types of contributions include:
*   Identifying what does or does not make sense in the directives and proposed actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. For example, comments on the term "weak signals" were received, suggesting it needs further explanation or plainer language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
*   Suggesting language changes, especially where terminology might mean something different in various cultural contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. An example is the distinction between "civil servant" and "public servant" in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   Assessing whether proposed actions are useful or impossible in specific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. For instance, feedback highlighted the need to stress that "failure" in [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] should be understood within the context of controlled experimentation for auditing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

Feedback is welcomed from anyone working in or alongside government, including the community and academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

## Nature and Implications of the OECD Declaration

The OECD declaration is intended to be an official OECD instrument, but it is **not legally binding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. Member countries can affirm their commitment to its ideals without being formally measured against obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

Its purpose is to:
*   Signal the importance of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] within government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.
*   Provide a source of "good ideas, good possible actions, good directives" to inform national [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.
*   Encourage governments to adopt a portfolio approach to [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], covering various types for different challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.
*   Inspire deeper reflection on how their systems are set up to support [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

### Different Levels of Government
While the OECD primarily works with national governments, the declaration's principles are relevant to all levels, including local and state governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. [[Public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] is viewed from an ecosystem perspective, recognizing that no single level or body can address all issues alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. Local and regional bodies can affirm their support for the declaration to signal commitment to their stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.

### [[Public Consultation Process for Innovation Declarations | Citizen Participation]]
[[Public Consultation Process for Innovation Declarations | Citizen participation]] is considered a crucial part of an effective [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. The declaration encourages governments to seek and listen to diverse voices, recognizing that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] relies on understanding different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.

### Leadership and Skills
The OECD also conducts ongoing research on the leadership mindsets and skills required to develop [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] competency and capability within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. Different forms of leadership and specific [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] skills are needed at various stages of the [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] process, from problem understanding and ecosystem engagement to implementation and ensuring innovations endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. This emphasizes the need for an ecosystem of diverse players to be involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

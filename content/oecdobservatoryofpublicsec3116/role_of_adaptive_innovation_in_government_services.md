[[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]] is defined as an innovation focused on the discovery process itself, rather than clear, predetermined goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Its primary purpose is to explore new ideas and uncover what is possible, which is crucial for the emergence of novel concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Characteristics and Purpose
Unlike typical approaches that operate within existing systems and paradigms, [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]] involves exploring new ideas on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These discoveries may either enhance current government services or challenge established systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For new ideas to surface, individuals require the freedom and space to explore from a bottom-up perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

People working closely with citizens can leverage signals from their lives to innovate, test, and experiment based on direct feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This approach can lead to both transformative changes and enhancement-oriented [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Example in Practice
[[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]] has manifested in various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For instance, in Canada, individuals developed applications in their spare time to make the regulatory system more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. These apps simplify understanding regulations, such as those applicable when establishing a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The focus shifted from merely simplifying regulations to making them understandable and usable for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

[[Anticipatory innovation]] is a key focus for the [[public sector]], aiming to prepare for and shape the future by understanding and acting upon future changes in present-day work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The terms "future proof" or "future fit" are only meaningful if organizations actively work in the present to better prepare for what's to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Importance of the Future in Public Policy
The future is critical for several reasons:
*   **Legitimacy of policy decisions in a democracy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Addressing major challenges** such as climate change and biodiversity loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Ensuring fast-moving digital transformation** is inclusive and beneficial for well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Strategic foresight makes a key contribution to strengthening democracy, promoting public trust, addressing climate change, and preparing governments to better serve societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The needs of the future are the work of the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Experimentation and Uncertainty
It is impossible to know the future in advance or have all the right answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. However, considering multiple alternative futures helps in imagining what might happen and making more prepared decisions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Experimentation, through learning and evidence gathering, is at the heart of modern [[Public Sector Innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This approach is essential for effective, democratic, and sustainable public policy, forming the basis of [[anticipatory innovation governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Challenges in the Public Sector
Several factors hinder effective [[anticipatory innovation in public sector]]:
*   **Organizational habits:** Precedents, policies, rules, routines, and a resistance to change based on past practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Culture and capabilities:** Social environments that might foster risk aversion or a lack of capacity for new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   **Reluctance to admit error:** It's difficult for large bureaucratic organizations to entertain the question "What if we were wrong?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Short-term policy pressure:** A strong focus on immediate policy and political needs, often demanding quick responses ("now") rather than long-term strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   **Efficiency and quantitative culture:** A preference for quantifiable outcomes and efficient processes can create barriers for qualitative foresight work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   **Lack of foresight literacy:** A general misunderstanding within organizations about how best to use foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

Cheryl Chung notes that while every organization thinks ahead implicitly or explicitly, the key question for futures is "What if we were wrong?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that disruptions exist and that being "pretty wrong" can have a dramatic impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

### Overcoming Challenges
*   **Focus on preparedness:** The current focus is on being prepared for disruptions, rather than just convincing people they might be wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Longer time horizons:** Adopting longer time horizons for problem-solving (e.g., a generation instead of six months) can change the policy options available and lead to more impactful solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
*   **Comfort with uncertainty:** Foresight aims to make people more comfortable with uncertainty, recognizing that it doesn't always mean something negative, and can be steered towards positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Dispelling the "myth of best practice":** In a future-oriented context, relying on past "best practices" is a myth because no one truly knows what will work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   **Designing experiments to learn together:** This involves the [[public sector]] collaborating with academia and the private sector in a deliberative learning processâ€”testing, observing, reflecting, and testing again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Foresight literacy training:** Offering courses and training to colleagues within organizations to build understanding and comfort with foresight methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
*   **Daily experimentation:** Due to the diversity of contexts and specific policy requests, foresight practitioners must constantly adapt and combine standard methods in new ways, making experimentation a daily reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

## OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI)
The OPSI team works on [[Anticipatory Innovation]] as one of four facets of [[Public Sector Innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. They recognize an "impact gap": while there's much strategic foresight and anticipation work, it doesn't always translate into impactful policy actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

OPSI's approach includes developing new prototyping methods to embed strategic foresight into national governments' work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. They aim to create innovative and value-changing prototypes and experiments to bridge the impact gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Flagship Projects and Resources
OPSI has collaborations with governments globally, including Finland, Latvia, Slovenia, Ireland, and Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   More information on their work logic can be found in their brief on [[anticipatory innovation governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   A recent report, "Building Foresight Systems," focuses on the government of Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

OPSI also hosts an annual conference, "Government Beyond Recovery," which is a highlight of their year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## European Union's Foresight Work
At the European Commission, the Joint Research Center's Competence Center for Foresight has a senior foresight expert, Laurent Bontoux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Their work involves integrating future-oriented systems thinking into new policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, using inclusive and participative techniques with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

Examples of their foresight work include:
*   Creating a shared vision for the EU Customs Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   Developing future sustainable transition pathways for jobs and economic development in the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   A qualitative foresight exercise on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the EU, used for the Commission's reflection paper "Towards a Sustainable Europe by 2030" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

A "wild dream" for Laurent Bontoux would be to organize a participatory foresight session with the College of the European Commission to explore scenarios and infuse foresight thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

## Singapore Futures at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy
Cheryl Chung is the Program Director of Executive Education Singapore Futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Her work focuses on the intersection of futures, public policy, and capability development for policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The Singapore Futures program aims to build futures and strategic foresight capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Cheryl Chung emphasizes that organizational habits are crucial in applying futures practice within a public policy context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. She argues that while it's tempting to focus on a beautiful vision of the future, "how do we get there?" comes down to practice and overcoming ingrained habits in large bureaucratic institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

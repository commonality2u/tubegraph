The [[role_of_innovation_in_public_administration | role of innovation in public administration]] is increasingly vital, requiring governments to make it a consistent, deliberate, and reliable resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. While public sector innovation often happens in an ad-hoc, reactive, or opportunistic manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, effective [[role_of_leadership_in_public_sector_innovation | leadership]] and [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | management]] are crucial for embedding innovation as a core competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Current State of Innovation in Public Services

In the Canadian context, there has been a long history of interest and an articulated ambition for more innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28]">[00:05:28]</a>. However, there's also been an ongoing struggle to find the right balance between ensuring appropriate controls and allowing for change and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00]">[00:06:00]</a>. This is because innovation is difficult, and no government worldwide has yet mastered it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17]">[00:06:17]</a>.

Key observations about [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation | challenges in implementing innovation]] include:
*   **Fragmented Understanding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25]">[00:14:25]</a>: There's a fragmented understanding of what innovation means, who is responsible for it, and why it's important. This ambiguity leads rational public servants to focus on clearer, more easily tracked agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53]">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Individuals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49]">[00:15:49]</a>: Innovation often relies on the "right person being in the right place at the right time" rather than being driven by strategic need or the merit of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49]">[00:15:49]</a>. This means individual determination often overcomes systemic barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08]">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Mismatch with Possibilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56]">[00:19:56]</a>: Governments may not be well-placed to take advantage of innovative options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34]">[00:16:34]</a>, as feedback loops tend to favor investment in clearly understood options over emergent ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41]">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Marginal Activity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30]">[00:20:30]</a>: Innovation is often seen as a "side of desk" activity, not integrated into core practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39]">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Three Levels of Innovation Analysis

To understand how [[role_of_leadership_in_public_sector_innovation | leadership]] and [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | management]] can foster innovation, it's useful to consider three levels of analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58]">[00:20:58]</a>:
*   **Individual Level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05]">[00:21:05]</a>: Innovation driven by personal motivation or response to specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57]">[00:22:57]</a>.
*   **Organizational Level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08]">[00:21:08]</a>: Innovation driven by addressing particular problems or crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11]">[00:23:11]</a>.
*   **System Level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11]">[00:21:11]</a>: Requires a clear signal for why innovation is wanted and needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32]">[00:23:32]</a>.

When system-level elements are absent, innovation falls to the organizational level, often siloed by partial agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24]">[00:21:24]</a>. If organizational support is also missing, innovation burdens individuals, forcing them to "push against a system" and go "above and beyond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43]">[00:21:43]</a>. This individual reliance is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06]">[00:22:06]</a>.

## Determinants of Innovation and Management's Role

Four core determinants shape whether and how innovation occurs, highlighting areas for [[role_of_leadership_in_public_sector_innovation | leadership]] intervention:

### 1. Clarity
*   **Concept**: A clear signal sent to system actors about innovation and its fit with other priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32]">[00:23:32]</a>, reducing ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40]">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Challenge**: Unlike the private sector's clear "profit" signal, the public sector's signal is "politics," which is changeable and noisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24]">[00:24:24]</a>.
*   **Leadership Actions**:
    *   **Build Shared Understanding**: Help actors understand what innovation means. Denmark's innovation barometer and agreed definitions serve as examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47]">[00:30:47]</a>. Canada's Declaration on Public Sector Innovation is a good start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26]">[00:31:26]</a>.
    *   **Relate to Priorities**: Ensure actors understand innovation in relation to other agendas. France's manifesto sets clear expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55]">[00:31:55]</a>.
    *   **Define Roles**: Clarify roles in the innovation system. Denmark's "innovation archetypes" help people understand their potential contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43]">[00:32:43]</a>. Canada's innovation labs offer hands-on experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26]">[00:33:26]</a>.
    *   **Connect to History**: Illustrate how innovation fits with shared history and context, showing it's not "foreign" to the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41]">[00:34:41]</a>.
*   **Prompting Question**: Do external system actors have a clear sense of what the public service means by innovation, where it's seeking innovation, and how they can contribute? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31]">[00:35:31]</a>

### 2. Parity
*   **Concept**: Innovation having equal standing with other considerations when proposing actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57]">[00:25:57]</a>.
*   **Challenge**: In the public sector, innovation often competes against incumbent forces, lacking the "marketplace for ideas" found in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27]">[00:25:27]</a>.
*   **Leadership Actions**:
    *   **Open Processes**: Ensure processes are open to challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12]">[00:37:12]</a>.
    *   **Circumvent Bottlenecks**: Provide ways to navigate or circumvent bureaucratic bottlenecks, especially at the middle management or "clay layer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12]">[01:03:12]</a>, by creating forums for sharing and developing ideas (e.g., GCconnects, GCcollab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45]">[01:23:45]</a>.
    *   **Cultivate Allies**: Help innovators find allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16]">[00:37:16]</a>.
    *   **Navigate Risk**: Support navigation of risk and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22]">[00:37:22]</a>.
*   **Prompting Question**: Does innovation have equal standing with other considerations when it comes to proposed courses of action? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05]">[00:37:05]</a>

### 3. Suitability
*   **Concept**: Ensuring appropriate capability systems and infrastructure for available innovative options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06]">[00:26:06]</a>.
*   **Challenge**: Public sector feedback loops favor what is already understood, making it a "taker" rather than a "shaper" in an evolving context, leading to a risk of the public service being unsuited to its environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36]">[00:26:36]</a>.
*   **Leadership Actions**:
    *   **Foster Learning**: Support parts of the system that learn from and keep pace with external change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47]">[00:37:47]</a>.
    *   **Socialize Technology**: Understand how technology is socialized within the public service and its implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03]">[00:38:03]</a>.
    *   **Expose Leaders to New Technologies**: Ensure leaders are exposed to new technologies and understand their potential impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07]">[00:38:07]</a>.
    *   **Explore New Operational Models**: Encourage exploration of new operational models, like Canada's Talent Cloud for HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14]">[00:38:14]</a>.
    *   **Track Changing Expectations**: Continuously track changing expectations from citizens and government to drive the appetite for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37]">[00:38:37]</a>.
    *   **Address Disruptive Technologies**: Deputy Minister Task Forces can explore and experiment with AI and blockchain to adapt and adopt these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19]">[01:18:19]</a>. A strong data strategy is foundational for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41]">[01:21:41]</a>.
*   **Prompting Question**: Are the capability systems and infrastructure appropriate and sufficient for the available options? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31]">[00:37:31]</a>

### 4. Normality
*   **Concept**: Innovation being seen as integral and routine, rather than an occasionally accepted deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51]">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Challenge**: The public sector traditionally values replicating behaviors and standardization, making it hard to integrate "difference" into core practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55]">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   **Leadership Actions**:
    *   **Support Behaviors**: Promote behaviors that support innovation, moving beyond mere replication and standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12]">[00:39:12]</a>.
    *   **Link Innovation to Core Business**: Actively link innovation to regular business activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28]">[00:39:28]</a>.
    *   **Socialize and Celebrate**: Socialize and celebrate innovation across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30]">[00:39:30]</a>.
    *   **Uphold and Defend**: Protect and defend innovation efforts when things inevitably go wrong, as experiments carry inherent risk of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33]">[00:39:33]</a>. The experimentation mandate in Canada helps by normalizing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57]">[01:04:57]</a>.
*   **Prompting Question**: Is innovation seen as integral rather than as an occasionally accepted deviation from the norm? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03]">[00:39:03]</a>

## Overcoming Risk Aversion

Risk aversion is a significant [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation | challenge in implementing innovation]] within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12]">[01:03:12]</a>.
*   **Balance Risks**: Instead of trying to eliminate risk aversion, the goal is to balance it by increasing awareness of the "risk of not innovating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33]">[01:04:33]</a>.
*   **Mandate Experimentation**: Structural forces like Canada's experimentation mandate help by making experimenting acceptable and expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57]">[01:04:57]</a>.
*   **Outcome-Based Focus**: Shift from activity-based initiatives to outcome-based approaches. Paying for outcomes means only investing when a desired result is achieved, potentially reducing overall risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09]">[01:08:09]</a>.
*   **Leverage Foundational Documents**: Much risk aversion operates by convention rather than strict policy. Leaders should encourage staff to refer to foundational policies and guidelines, which often allow for more flexibility than perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27]">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   **Storytelling**: Leaders can use effective storytelling to frame innovation in terms that resonate with different audiences (e.g., addressing risk concerns for middle management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01]">[01:25:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

Fostering innovation requires a collective effort, with [[role_of_leadership_in_public_sector_innovation | leadership]] playing a crucial role in creating a systemic, repeatable, and consistent environment for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40]">[00:43:40]</a>. This involves making the implicit explicit, empowering individuals to see themselves as part of the system, and identifying levers for intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35]">[00:42:35]</a>. By continuously seeking to improve clarity, parity, suitability, and normality within the innovation system, public services can better meet the evolving needs of a changing world.

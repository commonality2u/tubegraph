The concept of mission-oriented innovation emphasizes the critical role of [[publicprivate sector collaboration | public-private sector collaboration]] in addressing complex societal challenges, moving beyond traditional market-fixing approaches to actively shape and co-create new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>. This approach necessitates a fundamental shift in how public and private sectors work together, fostering shared risks and rewards to drive transformative change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Mission-Oriented Innovation: A Framework for Collaboration

Mission-oriented innovation is defined as a coordinated package of policy and regulatory measures in research and innovation, aiming to address societal challenges (like SDGs) across the entire innovation cycle, utilizing various instruments (supply-side, demand-side, top-down, bottom-up) across different policy fields, disciplines, and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>. These efforts are targeted at clear, ambitious, and concrete goals within a defined timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>.

### Redefining the Public Sector's Role

Historically, the role of the state in modern capitalism has often been viewed as problematic, primarily focused on "fixing markets" when they fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. However, mission-oriented innovation argues that the public sector should act as an "investor of first resort," actively shaping and co-creating markets rather than merely correcting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. This means engaging ex-ante with policymakers and understanding the messy reality of policy areas like industrial strategy and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>.

### Beyond Market Fixing: Market Shaping and Co-creation

The "market shaping" or "market co-creating" framework is central to this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>. It views public investment not just as filling gaps (e.g., correcting positive externalities in basic research) but as a proactive force in directing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. This involves:
*   **Market Co-creation:** Actively building and influencing new markets, rather than solely intervening when existing markets underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
*   **Risk Sharing and Reward Sharing:** Recognizing that public entities take on significant risks in pioneering innovation, akin to private venture capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. Therefore, the rewards from successful innovations should also be shared, influencing aspects like intellectual property rights (IPR) and pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
*   **Tilting the Direction of Growth:** Using public policy to strategically guide economic development towards desired outcomes, such as sustainable and inclusive growth, by creating portfolios of investments rather than putting all eggs in one basket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.

## The Quadruple Helix: Including Citizens in Innovation

Effective [[publicprivate partnerships in technology and innovation | public-private partnerships in technology and innovation]] often extend beyond the traditional "triple helix" (researchers, entrepreneurs, government) to a "quadruple helix," which explicitly includes citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06">[01:42:06]</a>. This model ensures that solutions are rooted in real needs and foster broader engagement, empowering communities to participate in co-creating solutions and monitoring progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:43">[01:42:43]</a>.

## Challenges to Effective Public-Private Collaboration

Implementing mission-oriented innovation and fostering robust [[partnerships between public sector and private sector for innovation | partnerships between public sector and private sector for innovation]] faces several hurdles:

*   **Siloed Structures and Incentives:** Governments often have rigid structures and incentive systems that discourage cross-departmental collaboration, favoring siloed approaches over collective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.
*   **Risk-Taking and Evaluation:** Public servants, particularly decision-makers, often face pressure regarding evaluation metrics, making them hesitant to take risks. Traditional evaluation methods (e.g., cost-benefit analysis) may not adequately capture the dynamic spillovers and long-term impacts of mission-oriented investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact and Rewards:** Without clear metrics for symbiotic partnerships, it's difficult to distinguish functional from dysfunctional collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>. The absence of mechanisms to "reap the rewards" from public successes also disincentivizes risk-taking and learning from failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy:** Overcoming administrative instruments and deeply ingrained organizational cultures is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a>.

## Case Studies in Action

Several examples illustrate the practical application of [[partnerships in public private innovation | partnerships in public private innovation]] and the lessons learned:

## Key Principles for Successful Public-Private Partnerships

Observations from various [[comparison of innovation between public and private sectors | public and private sectors]] reveal recurring principles for effective collaboration:

*   **Direction-Led and Goal-Oriented:** Missions must provide clear direction for growth, transcending growth for its own sake, to achieve specific outcomes like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>.
*   **Building Relationships and Trust:** Collaboration is fundamentally about people and fostering trusted personal relationships, mutual understanding, and shared vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:44">[02:04:44]</a>. This means breaking down silos and creating ecosystems where knowledge can flow between actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:02">[02:05:02]</a>.
*   **Adaptive and Iterative Design:** Mission design should be flexible, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation based on new information and conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. Solutions should not be "nailed down" too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:49">[02:02:49]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Assets and Networks:** Instead of solely relying on new funding, effective collaboration identifies and utilizes existing systems, investments, and networks to achieve mission objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:21">[02:04:21]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Urgency of Collaborative Innovation

In the face of urgent global challenges like climate change, [[public_sector_innovation_and_crosssector_collaboration | public sector innovation and cross-sector collaboration]] is more critical than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>. The current moment, with global recovery schemes, presents a unique opportunity to embed concepts of public value and mission-oriented thinking into how public and private entities work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. This requires not only a shift in mindset but also the development of new tools, methods, and [[collaborative_learning_and_innovation_in_government | collaborative learning and innovation in government]] processes to enable practical implementation and ensure that missions lead to tangible, systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a>.

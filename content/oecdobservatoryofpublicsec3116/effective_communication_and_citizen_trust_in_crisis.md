The COVID-19 pandemic has served as a critical test for governments worldwide, revealing profound lessons about governance, particularly concerning the vital role of communication and citizen trust during times of crisis. The "Government After Shock Round Table" brought together leaders to reflect on what has worked, what hasn't, and what remains to be learned regarding the practice of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. A key theme emerging from these discussions is the indispensable link between transparent communication and the [[Building and Maintaining Public Trust | trust]] of citizens, which significantly impacts the effectiveness of government responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>.

## Communication as a Cornerstone of Trust

Several countries highlighted communication as fundamental to their crisis management strategies:

*   **Georgia** emphasized that the way the government communicated with its citizens helped build [[Building public trust in institutions | trust]] and societal consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. From the crisis's outset, the public was educated and informed transparently, even about difficult information, involving epidemiologists and specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. The government's willingness to admit mistakes and make corrective actions based on public feedback further contributed to this confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Portugal** implemented a "massive communication campaign" early in the pandemic, focusing on keeping citizens informed through a dedicated website and app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. This focus on strong communication, coupled with a human-centered approach to digital transformation, reinforces [[Public trust and governance | trust]] and empowers citizens to act and comply with measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
*   **South Africa** found that the clear communication from the Minister of Health and the President, signaling the seriousness of the pandemic, instilled [[Building public trust in institutions | trust]] and legitimacy in government messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This trust was reflected in public compliance with measures like mask-wearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Slovenia** identified fake news as a challenge to obtaining trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. The key to countering this and building trust is to involve experts, such as doctors and epidemiologists, and ensure correct information reaches the people through digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## The Impact of Trust on Policy Implementation

[[Public trust and governance | Citizen trust]] in government significantly influences the ease or difficulty of implementing decisions during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

*   In **Georgia**, the high level of trust and consolidation of society led to no public protests against government decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. The government's improved trust from the population was a key factor in its successful management of the pandemic's first phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   For **Portugal**, trust is seen as the "cornerstone of our governance models and our Democratic societies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. It is viewed as what makes the difference between success and unsuccess of measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **South Africa** noted that despite scaling down lockdown levels, citizens continued to comply because they trusted the government's communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This trust enabled the country to minimize the spread of the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

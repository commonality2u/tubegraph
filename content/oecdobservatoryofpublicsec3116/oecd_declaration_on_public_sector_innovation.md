The [[public_sector_innovation_declaration | OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation]] is a high-level instrument developed to provide guidance to governments on how to steer and promote [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | Innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Its primary purpose is to bridge the gap between good intentions and actual practices in [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The Declaration, since its creation over five years ago, has been adhered to by 43 countries, signifying its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Principles of the Declaration
The [[public_sector_innovation_declaration | Declaration]] is built upon five core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>:

1.  **Embrace and Champion [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | Innovation]]**: Governments should embrace and champion [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | Innovation]] within the public sector, providing high-level sponsorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
2.  **Encourage and Equip Public Servants**: All public servants should be encouraged and equipped to innovate, ensuring that skills and incentives are in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
3.  **Cultivate New Partnerships and Diverse Voices**: It is crucial to go beyond government walls, relying on the wisdom and motivation of ecosystem stakeholders, and ensuring everyone has a say in how [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | Innovation]] is created, implemented, and iterated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This requires an inclusive approach to [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | Innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
4.  **Support Exploration, Iteration, and Testing**: [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | Innovation]] involves taking risks, but these can be managed in controlled environments using robust methods for learning from errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
5.  **Diffuse Lessons and Share Practices**: There should be no monopolies of [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]]; it is inherently shareable and built in partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Sharing experiences allows for learning from others and improving activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Role and Impact
The [[public_sector_innovation_declaration | Declaration]] provides a common understanding of [[public_sector_innovation | public innovation]] and how to foster it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. Adherence to the Declaration, such as Chile's signing in 2019, demonstrates a government's commitment to this agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. The [[role_of_oecd_in_public_sector_innovation | OECD's role]] as a recognized organization for best practices provides significant legitimacy and technical support for implementing the Declaration's principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

For countries like Sweden, the Declaration provides a mandate and legitimacy for the complex work of [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. It aligns with government goals for innovation and cooperation, offering a guiding framework to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

In Romania, joining the Declaration introduced the new concept of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]], which was not previously well-defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. It helped raise awareness and explain the concept to public sector leaders and servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. The Declaration's holistic vision of [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] — encompassing projects, skills, and sponsorship — is crucial for integrated government work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>.

## Connection to the Innovation Playbook
The [[innovation_playbook | Innovation Playbook]] was developed to translate the [[public_sector_innovation_declaration | OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation]] into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. It serves as a practical tool to apply the Declaration's principles in distinct contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The Playbook aims to be accessible, actionable, user-centric, adaptable, and capable of building connections among innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

The [[innovation_playbook | Playbook]] offers a simple journey for applying the principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>:
1.  **Frame the Challenge**: Identify and translate problems into actionable challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
2.  **Take Stock**: Assess current standing, identifying areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
3.  **Apply Solutions**: Utilize collective intelligence from use cases, tools, and actions contributed by the Playbook's co-creators, adapting them to specific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

The [[innovation_playbook | Playbook]] was co-created by 12 countries, starting with a simple Word document mockup and evolving through iterations to include tools and cases based on community feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. It is available in English and other national languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

The ongoing discussion around skills for the future in the public sector emphasizes the need to identify and effectively develop these competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This dialogue highlights crucial elements such as the future of work in public service, how public employers are preparing for a more digital and flexible future, and ensuring the workforce is equipped with the right skills and management structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. At its core, this revolves around effective talent management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Public Managers' Readiness to Adapt Post-Crisis

A poll conducted during the discussion revealed varying perspectives on public managers' readiness for change in the COVID-19 recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
*   **50%** believe public managers acknowledge lessons learned but are less willing to change actions and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
*   **28%** are optimistic, thinking managers are willing and ready to learn and adapt management methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
*   **21%** suggest management is eager to return to the pre-COVID old normal status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

This indicates that while there is much to learn, materializing these learnings into action remains challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape of Public Service

The pandemic has radically changed how public administration works and how employees operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. The old stereotype of public administration being rigid and inflexible has been challenged, proving it can be resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. However, there is still organizational inertia in terms of existing policies, precedent, competencies, and routines that hinder change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Key challenges for the public sector include:
*   **Digital Transformation:** Digital technologies are constantly evolving, requiring integration into working methods and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Public administrations that embraced digital tools quickly were more efficient in deploying crisis measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
*   **Multi-generational Workforce:** The entry of millennials with different mentalities and demands, coupled with an aging workforce, necessitates significant changes in public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
*   **Complex Problems:** "Super wicked problems" like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) require new, more agile, and collaborative approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **Increased Public Demand:** Crises lead to increased demands from public administration for protection and assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

## The Crucial Role of Leadership

[[Role of leadership in public sector innovation | Leadership]] is critical in recognizing the need for talent and creating an environment for it to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The capability of leaders is more important than ever during times of crisis and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

### Shifting Leadership Models
Traditional top-down, centralized leadership models might be insufficient for driving the necessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. A more distributed, bottom-up approach is being explored, perhaps even involving "shadow boards" of young people to give them power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. This also involves diversifying the workforce beyond traditional professions to include a "civil service of professions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

Leaders must focus on results, reward efficiency, and encourage continuous self-development among employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. This requires a shift from being process-driven to being results-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>. Emphasis is also placed on training programs in areas like leadership, communication, crisis management, and digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>.

### Soft Skills in Leadership
Beyond traditional competencies, leaders need to develop "soft skills" which are often the most difficult to cultivate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>. These include:
*   Critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>
*   Creative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>
*   Teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>
*   Empathy and care for each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>
*   Adaptation to change and its management in complex environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>

## The Power of [[Building Trust in Public Services | Trust]]

[[Building trust in public services | Trust]] is the "glue" that connects people and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>. It is a two-way street that needs to evolve within individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
*   **Internal Trust:** Leaders must transition from a directive model to one that creates trust to achieve results, especially in complex, hybrid teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. Organizations where there was more trust were faster and more efficient in deploying crisis measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.
*   **External Trust:** Leaders must create psychological safety where staff can speak up freely and constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>, abandon a "blame error culture" to foster innovation and allow for mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. This is particularly challenging in the public sector due to accountability for taxpayer money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.
*   **Public Trust:** [[Public trust and governance | Public trust in institutions]] is crucial, as increased demands on public administration during crises highlight the need for a protective and assistive government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

## New Ways of Working and Learning

The crisis has led to the adoption of new working principles:
*   **Hybrid Work Models:** Many organizations are adopting hybrid models based on dialogue with employees, allowing for remote work while maintaining team connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.
*   **Flexible Arrangements:** Flexible working arrangements, such as job sharing, concentrated hours, and organized team rotations, are being explored to cater to individual needs and ensure business continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.
*   **Digital Collaboration Tools:** The rapid adoption of digital tools like Mural and Miro has facilitated collective intelligence, allowing participants to share ideas on an equal footing and structure elements more clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.
*   **Innovation in Policy-Making:** [[Role of leadership in public sector innovation | Innovation]] in policy-making involves regular engagement with citizens and civil society, adopting a listening and co-design approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>. This also means breaking down policy silos and thinking together across sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.

### Scalable Learning Tools
Effective learning goes beyond traditional classroom settings and aims to integrate into daily work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>:
*   **Anticipation and Foresight:** Shifting from planning the future based on past events to anticipating future challenges is a critical learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>.
*   **Experiential Learning:** Experiential learning, such as "inequality walks" (now adapted to online formats), trains observational skills, empathy, and the ability to navigate complex, messy policy processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Management Hubs:** Developing "centers of excellence" or "one-stop stores" for knowledge sharing can foster collaborative training, cross-cultural experience exchange, and improved internal communication, especially vital in hybrid work environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.
*   **Targeted Soft Skill Development:** Programs like "master talks" focused on effective communication, self-leadership, effective meetings, public speaking, and cross-departmental collaboration are essential for hybrid work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.

## Distinguishing Public and Private Sectors

While many principles apply to both public and private sectors, certain distinctions remain relevant for the public sector:
*   **Recruitment and Expertise:** The public sector is generally slower in recruiting and integrating new expertise, making it crucial to leverage existing talent through training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.
*   **Technological Deployment:** Implementing new technologies in the public sector involves immense security considerations due to the scale and sensitivity of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>.
*   **Accountability and Risk-Taking:** Public organizations face higher scrutiny regarding taxpayer money, making it challenging to foster innovation and allow for mistakes without robust support from senior management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.
*   **Evolving Roles:** The increasing power of private sector tech giants with vast data on citizen behavior raises questions about the relative roles and strengths of public versus private sectors, potentially leading to a blurring of boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.

In conclusion, the post-crisis period presents a unique opportunity to renew the image of public service, making it an attractive workplace through extensive use of digital technologies, remote working models, and a focus on work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>. This requires not only adapting to changes but actively driving transformation within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>.

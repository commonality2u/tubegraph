The relationship between government and citizens is undergoing a significant transformation, driven in part by [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_participation | democratic innovations]] and the increasing prominence of digital spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## From Consumer to Citizen
Traditionally, the role of the individual in democracy has often been framed as a "consumer democracy," where citizens choose from available options rather than actively shaping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This contrasts with a model where individuals are active participants in shaping policy and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The New Citizenship Project advocates for a shift from viewing people as consumers to seeing them as citizens, opening up new possibilities for [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_participation | democratic innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This reframe aims to make democracy a more joyful, meaningful, and dynamic experience, moving beyond mere "uploading of a couple of kilobytes of data every few years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## The Digital Shift and its Challenges
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated the shift towards [[the_role_of_digital_and_virtual_platforms_in_public_engagement | digital and virtual platforms in public engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. While this demonstrated the possibility of conducting deliberative processes online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>, it also highlighted concerns about the over-reliance on screens and the potential erosion of physical reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Adults spent an average of nine hours per day in front of screens in 2019, increasing to 13 hours per day during lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

### Concerns about Digital Capitalism
A significant concern is the increasing privatization of public digital spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. Platforms like Zoom, Twitter, and Facebook, while facilitating discussion, are private entities whose business models often premise on consumption and advertising, creating an "unhealthy dynamic" for political discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. This phenomenon, termed "surveillance capitalism" or "digital feudalism," implies that users are unknowingly contributing to the wealth of tech elites by providing free data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. A proposed solution is to reverse the business model, where users get paid for their data rather than paying monthly fees for devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>. The right to privacy and the ability to "switch off" and be invisible are deemed crucial for the future of democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.

## The Role of Physical Spaces
The importance of physical democratic spaces is stressed, as these spaces shape relationships and possibilities for interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. Face-to-face contact remains immense and necessary to overcome societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. The disappearance of public physical spaces, even areas outside city halls becoming privately owned, further complicates democratic engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

## Empowering Citizens in Policy Making
There is a broader shift in the relationship between government and citizens through [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_participation | democratic innovations]] across local, regional, and international levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Citizens' expectations for participation in public decision-making have changed, with less trust in government but increased engagement on issues affecting their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. They desire to contribute meaningfully to shaping decisions and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Democratic Innovations in Practice
*   **Citizens' Assemblies**: Initiatives like Agora Brussels aim for the permanent installation of citizen assembliesâ€”deliberative bodies of randomly selected citizens who have a say in policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **The Conference on the Future of Europe**: This large-scale [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_participation | democratic participatory exercise]] with a strong deliberative dimension involves European citizens' panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. It mixes citizens with politicians in a plenary setting, allowing citizen recommendations to set the agenda for working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. The conference is seen as catalyzing a longer-term change in the relationship with EU institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Democratic Fitness**: The concept of "democratic fitness" emphasizes strengthening people's democratic muscles through practice and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Organizations like We Do Democracy in Denmark train young people in "democratic muscles" such as listening, empathy, compromising, and activism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook
A critical challenge is ensuring that citizen proposals translate into actual initiatives and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>, requiring new notions of legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. There is a risk that if outputs are ignored or processes lack public confidence, they could do more harm than good, leading to frustration among participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. While "yes, and" approaches are encouraged, where citizens engage with opportunities offered even if imperfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>, policymakers must also genuinely trust citizens and devolve meaningful power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

The evolution of democracy can be seen as "birthing pains" in the transition from purely representative to more participatory models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. Viewing citizens involved in processes like assemblies as "citizen representatives" allows for rethinking and redesigning representative democracy rather than replacing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.
Future progress requires a "cultural change" in media to report more on peaceful, innovative democratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>, and for solutions to be "made with the people, not just for the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:45">[01:09:45]</a>.

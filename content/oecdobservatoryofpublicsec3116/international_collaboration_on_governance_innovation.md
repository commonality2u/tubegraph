In a world facing complex global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, energy crises, and high inflation, the future remains uncertain and "a little bit Misty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This environment, however, presents a significant opportunity to build more resilient public sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Public sectors are considered the cornerstone in difficult situations, necessitating a focus on identifying strengths and areas needing improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A key strategy for addressing these challenges is robust [[international_collaboration_on_innovation | international collaboration on innovation]] and governance.

## Finland: A Pioneer in [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance]]

Finland is undergoing one of its largest public sector transformations, including the creation of welfare counties, which represents an entirely new level of public governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Faced with numerous crises, Finland aims to become more proactive in tackling emerging issues and plans to take concrete steps towards [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | proactive governance]] in the next government term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The nation is strongly committed to [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | collaboration with the international arena]] to share experiences and develop know-how in governance systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Over two years, Finland has collaborated with the OECD to develop and test an [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:51">[02:09:51]</a>. This model focuses on creating knowledge about the future and making decisions based on that knowledge, essentially "taking action today towards the future outlook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:50">[02:18:50]</a>.

### Key Aspects of Finland's Approach:

*   **Agency and Authorizing Environment:** The model assesses both the agency of public servants and the feedback system that allows for anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:03">[02:30:03]</a>.
*   **Action Research and Pilots:** Initial assessments led to pilot projects in continuous learning, carbon neutrality, child well-being, and dialogues between politicians and administrative staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Integrating Functions:** The approach is not to redo the entire government, but to integrate [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation]] functions into existing government processes like strategy planning, budgetary decisions, legislation, and human resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:58">[02:36:58]</a>.
*   **New Government Functions:** The need for a "government transition function" was identified to ensure continuity of complex, long-term policies across different government terms and to prevent loss of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:54">[02:56:54]</a>.
*   **Transparent Planning:** Improving transparency and clarity in analyzing and assigning responsibility for emerging issues across ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:16">[02:58:16]</a>.
*   **Citizen Involvement:** A core goal is to involve citizens in discussing future, anticipatory issues throughout the policy cycle, ensuring their knowledge is integrated and building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:06">[03:00:06]</a>.

> "Our citizens are not that much involved in few in when we talk about future issues, those issues that are just arising, those are kind of anticipatory issues... we are doing this for the citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:44">[03:47:44]</a>.

## European Commission's Support for [[Anticipatory Innovation and Governance]]

The European Commission views [[anticipatory_innovation_and_governance | anticipatory innovation and foresight]] as essential elements of public administration, especially as citizens turn to government during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. The Director General for Structural Reform Support coordinates policy-making on the quality of public administration, leading studies and exchanging with member states and experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

The Commission is fully committed to supporting member states in adopting [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] through financial aid and technical/intellectual advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

### Examples of Commission-Supported [[International Collaboration on Innovation]]:

*   **Latvia:** Work with the OECD to build an innovation lab, disrupting public administration through analysis and policy design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.
*   **Cyprus:** Drawing lessons from the COVID-19 crisis to increase the state's capacity to plan for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.
*   **Multi-country projects:**
    *   Building capacity for evidence-informed policy making in a post-pandemic Europe, involving the Joint Research Center of the European Commission, OECD, Greece, Belgium, Czechia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
    *   Strengthening the resilience of public administration after the COVID-19 crisis with the Common Assessment Framework 2020, involving 12 member states (Belgium, Bulgaria, Austria, Croatia, Italy, Finland, Spain, Poland, Portugal, Greece, Slovenia, and Slovakia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

The Finnish project's findings are expected to serve as a blueprint for other member states to better plan and adapt to evolutions and future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.

## [[Global Trends in Governmental Innovation]]: Upcoming Challenges for Europe

European administrations face increasingly complex policy issues in a world of "super wicked problems" like climate change and "black swan events" such as COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. [[Anticipatory innovation capacity]] is central to addressing these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

### Five Identified Future Challenges:

1.  **Unprecedented speed of technological change:** Requires adapting administration methods and enabling human-centricity in public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.
2.  **Impact of demographic changes and increasing skills shortage:** New skills are needed to develop solutions and maintain/improve administrative capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.
3.  **Increasing complexity of managing policy issues:** Encourages a culture of innovation at all levels of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.
4.  **Impact and importance of the green transition:** Administrations need leadership, competence, knowledge, accountability, and transparency to achieve climate neutrality goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.
5.  **Increase in competition for limited public funding:** Requires prioritization, leadership, innovative thinking, and improved financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.

Complexity can be managed with the right decision-making and [[collaborative_learning_and_innovation_in_government | cooperative systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. Public administrations' primary challenge is building resilience through stable, efficient processes and a capacity for disruption, allowing them to challenge, innovate, adapt, and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.

## International Perspectives on [[Crossborder Government Collaboration and Innovation]]

A poll conducted during the discussion revealed that a majority of participants were "somewhat" or "not at all" confident in their government's ability to anticipate future risks and innovate accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:01">[01:57:01]</a>. This highlights the widespread nature of the challenges Finland is tackling.

### Relevance in Other Countries:

*   **Netherlands:** The [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | AIG model]] could fit well, given its open nature and broad policy discussions, though a structured approach is not yet in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>. Challenges include translating innovations into policy and overcoming public servants' risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>.
*   **Norway:** Similarities with Finland make Norway an ideal candidate for exploring and applying [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation]]. Initiatives exist at municipal, regional, and government levels to challenge silos and create new ways of [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | collaborating]] on complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. Examples include scenario planning for election influence and developing future-fit public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.
*   **Portugal:** Despite geographical differences, Portugal faces similar challenges of uncertainty and limited resources. The new PlanAPP (competence center for planning, foresight, monitoring public policy) aims to cut silos and provide a more holistic response to future challenges and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. Portugal is focused on building an "Innovation Starter Kit" and fostering a culture that promotes and integrates foresight and innovation within the public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.

A major takeaway from Finland's experience is the systematic approach to connecting future support and systems to policy-making, moving beyond isolated initiatives to a more structural way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.

## The Path Forward: Fostering a Culture of Anticipation

The insights gained from Finland's work and the broader discussion highlight that [[anticipatory innovation]] is not an "extra layer" but an essential driver for public sector effectiveness and part of the culture of a modern public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>. It helps governments remain dynamic, explore possibilities, experiment, and continuously learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>.

[!INFO] **Key Takeaways from the Discussion:**
*   **Beyond Laws:** The demand for [[anticipatory innovation]] doesn't primarily come from laws or degrees, but from the recognition that traditional reactive approaches are too resource-intensive, and from the need for proactive solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>.
*   **Community Building:** Bringing different communities (innovation, steering systems, open government, civil service capabilities) together creates a powerful demand for coordinated action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>.
*   **Citizen-Centricity:** Involving citizens in discussing future issues is crucial for building trust and resilience, as their demands are continuously growing, and governments need to be proactively shaping the future for them, not just reacting to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Equipping Civil Servants:** Providing toolkits, fostering capacity building, and strengthening skills are vital for equipping civil servants to innovate and experiment in a future-oriented way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.

The OECD emphasizes that [[anticipatory innovation]] approaches are "not nice to have" but "critical to index and integrates the governments and how they work and deliver in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a>. This pioneering work by Finland, supported by [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | international collaboration]], serves as a blueprint for other countries to learn from and apply, fostering greater resilience and trust in public institutions globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:36">[01:30:36]</a>.

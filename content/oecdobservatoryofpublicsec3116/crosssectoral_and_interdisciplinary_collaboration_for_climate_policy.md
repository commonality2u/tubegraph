Effective climate policy requires strong [[intergovernmental_and_crosssectoral_collaboration | cross-sectoral]] and interdisciplinary approaches, moving beyond traditional siloed government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This collaborative mindset is crucial for addressing the complex, economy-wide challenge of climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

## Challenges to Collaboration
Despite the clear need, many governments are not adequately equipped for the "radical collaboration" required to tackle climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. Key challenges include:
*   **Siloed Operations** A persistent perception exists that climate policy is solely the responsibility of environmental departments, rather than a [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | whole-of-government]] endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. This often results in environmental ministers lacking high-level influence within cabinet systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.
*   **Inadequate Consultation** Public consultation and engagement are often insufficient, leading to poor planning for community impacts and a risk of public backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
*   **Capacity Constraints** There are significant capacity limitations at local levels, hindering effective coordination across departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.
*   **Narrow KPIs and Siloed Budgets** These internal governmental issues can impede collaboration and lead to contradictory policy actions, as seen in the transport sector where a focus solely on electric vehicles might neglect broader solutions like public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
*   **Political Polarization and Short-termism** Climate change is increasingly politicized, making decarbonization harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Short election cycles can lead to policy flip-flops, preventing long-term consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Bureaucratic Inefficiencies** High-level presidential directives can be hampered by slow bureaucratic processes, impacting implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.

## Benefits of Collaboration
[[intergovernmental_and_crosssectoral_collaboration | Interdisciplinary collaboration]] is essential for driving systemic transformations that extend beyond new technologies to include skills enhancement, infrastructure development, behavioral changes, new business models, and regulatory reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Systemic Change** It moves policy from merely reducing harm to transforming entire systems, leading to more effective outcomes and co-benefits like improved health, safety, and equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Unified Vision** [[intergovernmental_and_crosssectoral_collaboration | Collaboration]] helps create a unifying goal that goes beyond piecemeal policies, aligning government agencies, businesses, and society towards shared objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.
*   **Integration Across Policy Areas** Aligning science, technology, and innovation (STI) policies with education, agriculture, transport, water, and energy sectors is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.

## Role of Mission Governance
The [[mission_governance_in_climate_policy | mission-oriented approach]] is a powerful tool to foster this collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Clear Objectives** It establishes clear, measurable objectives that anchor climate commitments within strategic planning, ensuring climate mitigation and adaptation are prioritized and guide resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   **Breaking Silos** Rather than working in isolation, ministries and public agencies can align their policies and actions coherently around defined climate missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **Capacity Building** [[mission_governance_in_climate_policy | Mission governance]] emphasizes strengthening capabilities of public officials and institutions, equipping them with technical expertise and adaptive policymaking skills for complex challenges like scenario forecasting and risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Based Decision Making** It supports evidence-based decision-making by integrating robust data and continuous learning into governance, enabling effective measurement of progress, understanding impacts, and policy adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Engagement** [[mission_governance_in_climate_policy | Mission governance]] fosters stronger stakeholder engagement—including business, civil society, and local communities—by promoting transparency and equity, ensuring policy decisions reflect broad societal interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Long-term Consistency** It can help ensure policy consistency across long time horizons, moving beyond short election cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## Examples of Collaboration in Practice
*   **United Kingdom** Has embedded [[mission_governance_in_climate_policy | mission governance]] at the center of government through a dedicated cabinet committee on climate change, chaired by the prime minister, to ensure unified action and coordinated implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. The UK Climate Change Committee advises on targets and pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Sweden** The Impact Innovation Programs include an accelerator function to build public sector capacity, providing officials with tools, data, and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Sweden also has cross-sectoral approaches to sustain political support across government terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. The Fossil-Free Sweden initiative involves private actors in planning climate targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **Denmark** The "Innomissions" explicitly integrate experimentation within mission portfolios, refining policies based on evidence and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The Innovation Fund Denmark invests significantly in four green mission partnerships focusing on areas like carbon capture, green fuels, and circular economy, combining climate action with economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>.
*   **South Africa** The Presidential Climate Commission, chaired by the president, was established to adopt a [[mission_governance_in_climate_policy | mission-oriented approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. This prevents climate policy from being seen as solely an environmental issue and ensures broader alignment across government departments and spheres (national, provincial, local) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
*   **Ireland** Has seen a significant advance in how national climate objectives are viewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>, with strong political leadership being crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:29">[01:22:29]</a>.

## Recommendations for Strengthening Collaboration
*   **Anchor Missions at the Center of Government**: High-level bodies, potentially chaired by prime ministers or presidents, are crucial for driving unified action and coordinated implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.
*   **Foster Radical Collaboration**: Governments must adapt to foster truly interdisciplinary and collaborative approaches across multiple agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
*   **Integrate Policies Broadly**: Innovation policies need to be integrated into broader climate commitments, with [[mission_governance_in_climate_policy | mission-oriented approaches]] playing a key role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This includes aligning STI policies with education, agriculture, transport, and other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.
*   **Develop Specific, Time-bound Missions**: Beyond broad national targets, specific sectoral missions with clear commitments and timelines are necessary for effective delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.
*   **Ensure Sustained Political Support**: Design governance mechanisms that can withstand changes in administration and geopolitical tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
*   **Enhance Societal Engagement**: Utilize dialogue mechanisms and citizen councils to ensure public participation and foster trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.

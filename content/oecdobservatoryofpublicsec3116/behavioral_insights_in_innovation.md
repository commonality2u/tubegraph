[[Understanding adaptive innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]] is a common practice in government innovation activities. It focuses on upgrading existing practices and systems, such as making taxation systems work "better, faster, quicker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Behavioral Insights as Enhancement-Oriented Innovation

When governments utilize [[behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | behavioral insights]], for instance, to encourage faster tax payments or to prompt more informed responses to inquiries, this can be categorized as enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Characteristics of Enhancement-Oriented Innovation

This type of innovation is generally low-risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It does not demand a transformation of existing systems but is implemented within current structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The risks associated with its implementation can also be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It allows for directing innovation to improve a specific system or exploiting existing ideas to enhance current practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

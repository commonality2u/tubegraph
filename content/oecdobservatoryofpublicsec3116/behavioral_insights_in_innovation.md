[[behavioral_insights | Behavioral insights]] are frequently utilized in government innovation activities, primarily within the context of enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Enhancement-Oriented Innovation
Enhancement-oriented innovation is one of the most common practices in government when they are attempting innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This approach centers on upgrading what already exists, such as enhancing current practices and systems within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Common examples include efforts to make taxation systems work better, faster, or quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Application of [[behavioral_insights | Behavioral Insights]]
Governments apply [[behavioral_insights | behavioral insights]] within this framework to achieve specific improvements. For instance, they might use these insights to encourage citizens to pay taxes faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> or to prompt more informed responses to different inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Such applications are characterized as enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Characteristics
*   **Low Risk** The risks associated with this type of innovation are relatively low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **No System Transformation** These innovations do not typically call for the transformation of entire systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Implementation within Current Structures** They are implemented within the existing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Calculable Risks** The risks connected to their implementation can be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

This approach allows for directed innovation to improve specific systems or to exploit existing ideas to enhance current practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

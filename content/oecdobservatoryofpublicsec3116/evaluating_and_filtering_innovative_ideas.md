Evaluating and filtering innovative ideas is a critical, yet often overlooked, step in the innovation lifecycle, following the [[ideation_process | generation of ideas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. It involves moving from a broad range of potential solutions to a select few that can be further explored and implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>. This process requires transparency and a systematic approach to ensure the selection of the best ideas, rather than the most popular ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.

## Challenges in the Public Sector

In the public sector, filtering ideas presents unique challenges:
*   **Lack of Transparency** Organizations often struggle to explain how ideas are selected, leading to a "secret sauce" perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.
*   **Bias Towards Popularity** There's a risk that ideas are chosen based on the influence or popularity of the person proposing them, rather than their merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.

## Limitations of Traditional Filtering Methods

Common, yet often insufficient, methods for filtering ideas include:

### Simplified Scoring Models
Traditional methods often rely on scoring ideas based on criteria like novelty, usefulness, value, acceptance, feasibility, risk, and endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. However, these models are often too simplistic because:
*   **Purpose-Dependent Criteria** The relevance of these criteria varies significantly depending on the specific purpose of the innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>.
    *   For **mission-oriented innovation** (e.g., solving poverty), the consistency of the idea with the mission is paramount. Novelty may be less important if an existing idea effectively contributes to the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.
    *   For **anticipatory or radical ideas** (e.g., exploring new technologies like blockchain), traditional notions of legitimacy or high risk may not be relevant, as these ideas often challenge existing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.

### Pitching Competitions (e.g., "Shark Tank")
Formats like "Shark Tank" or "Dragon's Den," where individuals pitch their ideas, often fall short because:
*   **Focus on Personality** They can become more about the presenter's characteristics and salesmanship than the inherent quality of the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.
*   **Exclusion of Diverse Thinkers** Many innovators, particularly those who are not extroverted or comfortable in confrontational settings, may be discouraged from participating, leading to a loss of valuable contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>. Bias from the decision-makers is a significant factor in these settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Filtering Ideas

There is no single "best" method for filtering ideas; the approach must be tailored to the specific context and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>. Key considerations include:

*   **Align with Goals and Outcomes** Be clear about the desired outcomes and implications of each filtering strategy before applying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>.
*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation** If the goal is to systematically solve a complex problem like poverty, it may be appropriate to explore many ideas that contribute to the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.
*   **Iterative Exploration** If the focus is on exploring different options in an iterative way, the aim might be to narrow down to a short list (e.g., 5-10 options) for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

## Checklist for Effective Ideation and Filtering

Before moving into filtering, ensure the [[ideation_process | ideation process]] itself is well-prepared. This simplified checklist can help assess readiness:

1.  **Problem Framing:** Have you deeply understood and [[identifying_problems | defined the problem]]? Avoid rushing to solutions with limited data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
2.  **Innovation Environment:** Do you understand the top-down/bottom-up dynamics, leadership's openness to change, and the political/organizational context? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a> This includes knowing the extent of the public sector's control over the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
3.  **Strategy Alignment:** Does your ideation strategy match the environment?
    *   For **emergent problems** with high uncertainty or little internal expertise, broad strategies like crowdsourcing or public consultations are useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
    *   For **understood problems** with less uncertainty, a smaller, selected group may suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
    *   For **complex or wicked problems** (e.g., homelessness, poverty), deeper engagement through co-creation with specific representative groups, citizen stories, or pitching to relevant stakeholders is more effective to explore difficult causal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
4.  **Inclusive Contribution:** Does your strategy allow *everyone* to contribute, regardless of their communication style (e.g., introverts vs. extroverts)? Ensure sufficient time for ideas to develop, possibly days or weeks, not just hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
5.  **Diverse Engagement:** Is your group diverse in backgrounds, thinking styles, and experiences? A lack of diversity can lead to [[groupthink | groupthink]] and limit creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.

## Self-Assessment Tool for Problem Understanding

The Observatory for Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) provides a self-assessment tool to rate understanding of the problem and readiness for ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This tool helps assess:
*   Whether the problem is clearly defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
*   The level of certainty and agreement about the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.
*   Whether the problem is likely to remain stable or shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.
*   The existence of previous solutions or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.
*   The presence of a clear, engaged problem owner with high-level discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

This self-assessment, rated on a one-to-five scale, helps guide the [[ideation_process | ideation process]] and subsequent phases like [[developing_innovation_proposals | proposal development]] and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.

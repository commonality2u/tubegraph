## Overview of the Project

This article discusses a project focusing on the intersection of public integrity and human behavior, specifically aiming to impact the public system and the lives of millions [00:00:34]. The project is a collaboration between Slovakia and the OECD [00:00:09]. The OECD, through its Indigo and ASIG divisions (behavioral and anti-corruption experts), presented this study [00:01:41].

The project involved a four-year collaboration with Slovak institutions, primarily the corruption prevention department and the government office, to enhance capacities in Slovak public administration and reinforce integrity [00:02:45]. It combined analytical work with efforts to improve civil servants' ability to implement integrity measures and develop concrete tools [00:03:08].

Key project areas included:
*   Incorporating a strategic approach to inform integrity policies, largely under the framework of Slovakia's former National anti-corruption policy [00:03:34].
*   Improving horizontal coordination across integrity functions to implement the strategic approach [00:03:51].
*   Engaging the whole of society in integrity efforts to ensure fit-for-purpose integrity reforms [00:04:07].
*   Applying a [[behavioral_insights | behavioral]] risk-based approach to corruption prevention [00:04:18]. This is crucial for identifying and mitigating prevalent risks in public institutions, making corruption prevention more effective, and strengthening civil servant accountability [00:04:25].

A foundational piece of work for the project was the Integrity review of the Slovak Republic, published in 2022, which offered a 360-degree view of Slovakia's integrity system [00:04:52]. The review highlighted that while Slovakia had measures to strengthen corruption risk management (e.g., methodological guidelines), their application was still lagging [00:05:21]. This challenge is not unique to Slovakia, as many OECD countries struggle with consistently applying corruption risk management frameworks in practice [00:05:46].

The project partners were keen to explore innovative ways to improve corruption risk management, including applying [[behavioral_insights | behavioral insights]] [00:06:31]. The report aims to be inspiring for Slovak institutions in strengthening corruption risk management and for other OECD and non-OECD countries facing similar challenges [00:06:51].

## [[behavioral_public_policy | Behavioral Public Policy]] and Integrity

The work is grounded in the OECD recommendation on public integrity, launched in 2017 [00:07:47]. This recommendation provides a sustainable and strategic approach to fighting corruption by shifting focus from ad-hoc policies to a context-dependent, [[behavioral_insights | behavioral]] risk-based approach to public integrity [00:08:02]. It also emphasizes cultivating a culture of integrity across society, involving public servants, businesses, civil society organizations, and citizens [00:08:25].

The OECD's first report on [[behavioral_insights | behavioral insights]] for public integrity was launched in 2018 [00:09:20].

### Why [[behavioral_insights | Behavioral Insights]] Matter for Anti-Corruption

[[behavioral_insights | Behavioral insights]] have significant implications in two main policy areas:

1.  **Supporting Ethical Choices** [00:10:09]: Traditional anti-corruption measures often assume people act corruptly if benefits outweigh costs [00:10:16]. However, experimental ethical research shows most people possess a moral compass that guides their actions, even when unobserved, and strive to act with integrity [00:10:35]. While people may sometimes act unethically, they often justify their actions to still feel honest [00:10:56]. This implies that policies should not exclusively target corrupt individuals, but rather empower the majority of public officials who wish to act correctly and create an environment that supports ethical choices, or an "open culture of integrity" [00:11:15]. This open culture allows public officials to feel comfortable discussing ethical concerns [00:12:09].

2.  **Ensuring Effective Implementation of Integrity Policies** [00:12:32]: Policies might fail to achieve desired impact or even backfire if the real behaviors and consequences for public officials are not considered [00:13:13]. Integrity policies encompass areas like corruption risk management, internal and external audit, managing conflicts of interest, and communication on integrity [00:12:49].

Since the 2018 report, the OECD has continued work on applying [[behavioral_insights | behavioral insights]] to public integrity, including corruption risk management, audit reports, and leadership, in countries like Brazil, Romania, Chile, and Slovakia [00:13:34]. The project in Slovakia produced experimental evidence, a first for this specific area [00:14:11]. This field of applying [[behavioral_insights | behavioral insights]] for public integrity is growing, with significant interest from OECD member countries [00:14:22].

## Applying [[behavioral_science | Behavioral Science]]: The BASIC Framework

The core question addressed by the experiment was how to prevent corruption in the Slovak public administration, specifically how to empower public sector employees to detect corruption risks and feel safe speaking out about them [00:14:48].

The project followed the **BASIC framework**, a five-step process for applied [[behavioral_science | Behavioral Science]] developed by the OECD in 2019 [00:15:31]:

1.  **Behavior (B)**: Understand the behavior to be changed and determine if [[behavioral_science | Behavioral Science]] or a structural approach is more suitable [00:15:52].
2.  **Analyze (A)**: Examine why the behavior occurs, including context and social norms [00:16:05].
3.  **Strategy (S)**: Identify [[behavioral_insights | behavioral]] strategies to counter identified biases [00:16:20].
4.  **Intervention (I)**: Empirically test interventions in practice to learn what works [00:16:34].
5.  **Change (C)**: Scale up successful interventions to create lasting change [00:16:52].

### Identifying Target Behaviors and Barriers

Through focus groups and interviews with anti-corruption coordinators and public officials in Slovakia, four types of behaviors were initially identified [00:17:24]:
*   Managers displaying a "ticking the box" behavior, formally complying but not acting in line with the code of conduct [00:17:42].
*   Misreporting progress related to the National Recovery and Resilience Plan to meet European obligations [00:18:03].
*   Underutilization of an electronic survey for reporting corruption risks, partly due to managers not encouraging its use [00:18:24].
*   A general culture of fear and silence preventing employees from speaking up about corruption risks [00:18:50]. Officials were aware of reporting actual incidents but found the line blurred for *potential* risks [00:19:08].

The focus narrowed to getting employees to speak up about corruption risks [00:20:31]. The other behaviors were deemed difficult to measure through an experiment (ticking the box), too specific to certain agencies (misreporting), or still under development (electronic survey) [00:19:59].

Drivers for not speaking up included:
*   Lack of good examples from leaders/managers [00:21:15].
*   Limited understanding of reporting channels, even if they exist [00:21:31].
*   Psychological costs, such as fear of retaliation [00:21:55].
*   Managers downplaying risks or not providing feedback when risks are raised [00:22:34]. A feedback mechanism did not exist, making employees question what would happen after reporting [00:22:49].

Specifically, the experiment targeted two barriers:
1.  Lack of understanding of what constitutes a reportable risk (i.e., potential corruption risks, not just incidents) [00:23:46].
2.  Lack of good examples from leaders [00:24:10].

## The Experiment: Design and Methodology

To test interventions targeting these two barriers, a randomized vignette experiment was conducted [00:25:00]. The population consisted of public officials in line Ministries and central authorities in Slovakia [00:26:17]. Participants were randomized into three groups: a control group (no intervention) and two treatment groups [00:25:16]. The hypothesis was that those receiving an intervention would be more likely to communicate risks [00:25:31].

### Trial Design
*   An email with a survey link was sent to potential participants [00:26:24].
*   Respondents were shown a vignette â€“ a short description of a hypothetical situation where a risk should ideally be reported [00:26:33]. The vignette described a situation where hiring procedures might lack control measures to mitigate conflicts of interest and transparency risks [00:27:15].
*   Participants in the two treatment groups then saw their respective interventions [00:26:45].
*   Finally, the same questions were asked of all participants to measure the effects on risk communication and secondary outcomes like feeling of safety [00:26:51].

### Interventions (Treatments)

1.  **Understanding of Risk Message**: Aimed to improve understanding of what a risk is by using an analogy from health [00:27:57]. The message stated that being honest with a doctor about risk factors (like smoking) helps diagnose cancer in time, and similarly, civil servants should be honest and speak about corruption risks (like conflicts of interest in hiring) to minimize them [00:28:15].
2.  **Exemplary Leadership Message**: Appealed to the importance of leader behavior [00:28:50]. The message asked participants to imagine their manager leading by example, raising hiring risks with executives, and encouraging colleagues to do the same [00:28:58]. It then reinforced that every civil servant should be honest and speak about corruption risks to minimize them [00:29:08].

Both messages also applied injunctive social norms by reminding that "every civil servant should be honest and speak about risks" [00:29:29]. To encourage participation, a lottery was conducted where three participants could have a 15-minute chat with the Prime Minister at the time [00:29:55].

### Sample Statistics
A total of 2,537 respondents participated, with approximately equal numbers in control and treatment groups [00:30:33]. The age distribution was approximately normal, with peaks suggesting approximations of ages (e.g., tens) [00:30:46]. Similarly, years in public administration showed approximations [00:31:04].

## Key Findings

*   In the control group (no intervention), the likelihood of communicating risks was 48% [00:31:47].
*   **Leadership message** was the most impactful: employees who saw this message were approximately **14 percentage points more likely** to communicate a risk compared to the control group [00:33:29].
*   **Understanding of risk message**: employees who saw this message were approximately **9 percentage points more likely** to communicate a risk compared to the control group [00:33:42].
*   The experiment demonstrated that [[behavioral_insights | behavioral insights]] can increase integrity among public officials [00:33:56].

### Additional Findings
*   **Age and Risk Communication**: Younger respondents were more likely to communicate a corruption risk [00:34:15]. An increase in age by one year decreased the likelihood to communicate an integrity risk by 0.23 percentage points [00:34:27]. This could be due to a greater fear of retaliation and status quo bias among older, more senior employees, or different beliefs formed through exposure to past corruption [01:19:30, 01:21:07]. Older generations might also have different social norms regarding what is considered ethical [01:23:37].
*   **Career Length**: Career length in public administration was not found to correlate with the likelihood to communicate a risk [00:34:37].
*   **Feeling of Safety**: People reported feeling generally safer after being asked whom they would communicate a risk to [00:35:00]. Both treatments increased the feeling of safety among respondents, but the effect sizes were small (around three percentage points) [00:35:32]. Those who preferred to communicate a risk to a manager felt significantly safer [00:35:52].
*   **Trust in Risk Management System**: The appropriateness of a risk management system was not correlated with the two treatments [00:36:38]. However, trust in the risk management system correlated with feeling safe and likelihood to communicate risks [00:36:58].
*   **Understanding of Risk (Vignette)**: Only 30.8% of respondents correctly identified the vignette situation as a corruption risk [00:37:40]. The treatments did not significantly improve the understanding of a risk among respondents [00:38:02].

## Policy Recommendations for Slovakia

Based on these findings, three main axes of work are recommended for Slovakia, especially as it formulates its new National anti-corruption strategy for 2024-2029 [00:38:41]:

1.  **Empower Leaders to Set the Standard**: Since leader example is highly effective, leaders should be empowered through training to act with integrity and set the right standard for their teams [00:39:31]. Anti-corruption coordinators also have a key role in setting examples and should work across ministries to redefine and develop code of conduct guidelines [00:39:52].
2.  **Make Risk Communication Easy and Well Understood**: Policies should align with how people behave [00:40:46]. Given the preference to report to managers, this channel should be safe and clear [00:40:50]. Awareness of existing channels (like electronic surveys) should be raised through clear, concise, and [[behavioral_insights | behaviorally]]-informed guidelines [00:40:59].
3.  **Cultivate a Culture of Safety**: Feelings of safety are critical for people to speak up [00:41:41]. This culture should be fostered and normalized [00:41:47].

## Expert Commentary and Future Directions

Experts highlighted the project's ambition, given the sensitive and difficult nature of studying public integrity directly with the target population [01:10:02].

Key insights from the discussion:
*   **Value of [[behavioral_insights | Behavioral Insights]]**: The approach effectively identifies concrete behaviors, understands their drivers, designs targeted interventions using simple but rigorously tested messages, and provides clear evaluation insights for next steps [01:00:07].
*   **Methodological Rigor**: The use of vignettes and randomized assignment is essential to establish causal connections between interventions and outcomes, minimizing social desirability bias and allowing for cost-effective testing of policies [00:45:34, 00:47:29].
*   **Magnitude of Effects**: The significant increase in reporting likelihood (from 48% to 62%) with minor changes in messaging demonstrates the power of [[behavioral_public_policy | behavioral public policy]] [00:48:08].
*   **Trust and Beliefs**: Further research could explore civil servants' expectations of leaders and co-workers, and their beliefs about their collective efficacy to enact change [00:50:11, 00:51:34]. The definition of trust as "believing the system works" is an interesting measure of group efficacy [00:51:37].
*   **Analogy Use**: The use of analogies (e.g., health risks) is crucial for helping people understand abstract concepts like corruption risks [01:11:20].
*   **Spillover Effects**: When scaling up, a challenge in testing across different offices could be strong spillovers, as employees may discuss interventions, potentially contaminating control groups [01:13:47].
*   **Leadership's Dual Role**: While leadership can be powerful and positive, "ticking the box" behavior by managers can have a negative impact, draining power and discouraging employees from reporting, especially if no feedback or action follows [01:14:34].
*   **Continuum of Risk Management**: Encouraging risk communication is foundational, but effective mitigation measures must follow to address identified risks; otherwise, the initial reporting loses its purpose [01:24:24].
*   **Broader Implications**: The findings resonate with research on speaking up about safety dangers, where around 50% of people report physical risks [01:06:08]. Similar factors like knowing how to report, trusting the system, and social norms from peers and bosses are key [01:06:59].
*   **Transforming Social Status**: Learning from Colombia's efforts to change the social status of those who report crimes from negative to positive could be valuable, by highlighting their role in helping the collective [01:07:39].
*   **Future Scale-up and Education**: While this project provides concrete lines of action, further large-scale, real-world experiments are needed, for example, comparing different reporting channels or the impact of training on real behavior [00:59:59, 01:06:00]. It was also suggested that education on integrity, risk management, and [[behavioral_insights | behavioral]] aspects should start earlier, at universities or high school levels, to cultivate a more integrity-aware society [01:28:23].

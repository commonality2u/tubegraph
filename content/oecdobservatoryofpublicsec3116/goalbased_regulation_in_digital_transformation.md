The shift towards [[digital_transformation_in_governance | digital transformation in governance]] necessitates a re-evaluation of traditional regulatory models, moving from prescriptive, rule-based approaches to more flexible, goal-based regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. This change is crucial given the complex and rapidly evolving nature of cyber-physical systems, where predictability is diminishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

## The Challenge of Digitalization for Governance

Previously, when societal systems were more static, governments could provide detailed rules, monitor compliance, and enforce mechanisms effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. However, the age of [[digital_transformation_and_data_governance | digitalization]] renders this static model insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. The rapid development of technologies like AI, IoT, interoperable software, and global networks has made lives more efficient but also introduced new challenges for governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. In a society based on complex and fast-changing cyber-physical systems, governance models must become more [[agile_regulatory_governance | agile and flexible]], leveraging the power of new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

## Smart Industrial Safety: A Case Study

Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) offers an example in "smart industrial safety," where data and AI are used to maintain plant or factory safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. Traditionally, regulations included detailed requirements for location, facilities, and operation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. However, individual plants can achieve better safety goals by monitoring real-time data from sensors, cameras, or drones, and using AI to detect risks and abnormal values immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

To promote this more innovative, efficient, and safer maintenance method, Japan changed its regulation in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. Under the new rule, if a plant operator can demonstrate high levels of safety using technologies, they can extend statutory inspection terms from annually to up to every eight years, providing significant benefits by reducing costly plant shutdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

## Governance Innovation Framework

METI's white paper, "Governance Innovation," outlines key points for transforming governance mechanisms:
*   **Rule Making:** Laws should be goal-based rather than rule-based to allow for innovative methods to achieve regulatory objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.
*   **Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration:** Under goal-based regulation, diverse stakeholders, including businesses and experts, should create guidelines and standards. This ensures even small companies can utilize technology effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Businesses primarily conduct real-time monitoring and are accountable for the collected [[the_role_of_data_in_regulation | data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. Guidelines and standards are continuously reviewed based on feedback from real-time data outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.
*   **Incentivized Enforcement:** Governments should incentivize businesses to cooperate with investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>. For instance, a default prosecution agreement (PA) could be introduced, where companies are not prosecuted if they cooperate with authorities and commit to resolving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>. This encourages transparency and disclosure of information, allowing governments to learn about future issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>.

## Designing and Learning from Goal-Based Systems

Defining the "goal" in goal-based regulation is inherently challenging. For example, striking a balance between privacy and efficiency in contact tracing apps, or defining the acceptable safety level for self-driving cars (e.g., how many fatalities are acceptable compared to human-driven vehicles), are not purely engineering questions but involve social, political, and even philosophical considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:24:00">[45:24:00]</a>.

Goals may also change over time. Therefore, the approach must be dynamic and experimentation-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50:00">[47:50:00]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Multi-stakeholder Discussion:** Engaging a wide range of stakeholders to discuss and define goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:18:00">[47:18:00]</a>.
2.  **Iterative Implementation:** Implementing technologies based on these goals and continuously checking whether they are achieved and if people are satisfied with the initial goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:24:00">[47:24:00]</a>.
3.  **Continuous Feedback Loop:** Maintaining a cycle of checking, reviewing, and adapting the goals and guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50:00">[47:50:00]</a>.

For governments to effectively learn from these systems, they need to check whether goals are achieved and provide appropriate standards or guidelines for private parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>. These standards should be developed through multi-stakeholder approaches, not purely by the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. Collaborative enforcement, where businesses are incentivized to disclose information without fear of immediate punishment if they cooperate and commit to improvement, is crucial for collecting valuable learning data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The shift to goal-based regulation aligns with the co-evolution of technology and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. It supports the concept of "upstream governance," where participatory elements are included in the early development of technologies, extending beyond pure market influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:56">[01:52:56]</a>. This can be seen in initiatives like "safe by design" and "AI ethics by design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:10">[01:19:10]</a>. "Living laboratories," where regulation and technology are co-developed (e.g., autonomous vehicles), exemplify this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

This approach acknowledges that it is impossible for governments to plan and order everything themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. Instead, it fosters a mindset where multi-stakeholder, goal-based, cross-discipline, and cross-border experimental approaches are key to navigating the inherent uncertainty and complexity of [[impacts_of_technological_change_on_regulation | technological change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.

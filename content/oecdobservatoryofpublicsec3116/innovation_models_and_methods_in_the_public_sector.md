The OPSI Toolkit Navigator: A Guide to Innovation Tools and Methods in the Public Sector
The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) developed the OPSI Toolkit Navigator to help public sector innovators find and utilize appropriate [[innovation_tools_and_methods_for_public_service | tools and methods]] for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This project was supported by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### The Challenge of Existing Toolkits
Initially, there was skepticism about the need for another toolkit, as hundreds already existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The goal shifted from building a new toolkit to helping people find the *right* toolkits based on their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Andrea Snook from the UK Policy Lab captured this sentiment: "Toolkits are like toothbrushes; everybody has one but nobody wants to use someone else's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Research into existing toolkits and user experiences of [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_organizations | public sector innovators]] revealed several common findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>:
*   **Over-reliance on past tools** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Misalignment with problems**, often chosen based on appearance or colleague use rather than actual need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Lack of consideration for existing skills**, with some requiring advanced skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Granularity issues**, being either too specific or too broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Creation of "learned helplessness"** in the public sector, as polished toolkits can be intimidating to adapt for unique contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### OPSI's Multifaceted Innovation Model
A core backdrop for the Navigator's design is OPSI's multifaceted innovation model, derived from system-level studies of governments like Canada and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This model identifies different purposes of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>:
*   **Directed/Shaping (Top-down)**: Mission-oriented [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]], like putting a person on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Undirected/Responding (Bottom-up)**: [[Public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] for its own sake, creating space for entrepreneurial spirit to find new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented (High Certainty)**: Improving existing processes and services, such as using behavioral insights to increase tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Exploring/Radical Shifts (Uncertain Spaces)**: Looking at how external and internal changes will fundamentally alter the nature of government work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Each of these [[types_of_public_sector_innovation | types of innovation]] is supported by different [[innovation_tools_and_methods_for_public_service | methods]] and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The choice of [[innovation_tools_and_methods_for_public_service | methods]] significantly biases [[impact_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. For example, investing in lean business process management or behavioral insights may lead to more enhancement-oriented [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Understanding this relationship and choosing [[innovation_tools_and_methods_for_public_service | methods]] according to purpose is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Characteristics of an Ideal Toolkit
Based on research, an ideal toolkit should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>:
*   **Adaptable and transferable**: Allowing for modification to suit different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Approachable and user-centered**: Easy to understand and apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Action-oriented**: Designed to lead to concrete actions, distinct from guidance or knowledge bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Modular**: Enabling users to combine parts from different toolkits to fit their specific problem and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Organizing Toolkits by "Jobs to Be Done"
The Navigator organizes toolkits around "innovation tasks" or "jobs to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. While typical toolkits focus on problem-solving jobs (e.g., discovery, prototyping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, the Navigator also accounts for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>:
*   **Group behavioral jobs**: Building consensus, shared understanding, converging on decisions, challenging assumptions, cultivating mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Approach planning jobs**: Preliminary scoping and getting started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Contextualization jobs**: Understanding the dynamics of the working environment, visualizing systems, or imagining different futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

These categories acknowledge that an [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_organizations | innovator's work]] extends beyond mere problem-solving to include group coordination and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Levels of Granularity
Toolkits can vary in their level of abstraction, from broad methodologies (like design methodology) to specific techniques (like using paper-based forms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The Navigator helps users find toolkits at the right level of abstraction for their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Some practices, like behavioral insights, are better served by detailed manuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### Development and User-Centered Design
The Navigator was developed through extensive analysis of hundreds of toolkits, tagging them with disciplines, jobs, and inclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Initial designs and prototypes were rigorously tested with public sector innovators and national government [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_organizations | innovation leaders]], leading to significant design changes based on over 300 pieces of feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:14:44]</a>.

### Encouraging Capacity Building
A key [[principles_of_public_sector_innovation | principle]] behind the Navigator is that building [[public_sector_innovation | innovative capacity]] is best achieved by building or adapting one's own toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Therefore, special emphasis is placed on freely accessible toolkits, including those that allow for reuse, adaptation, and remixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Toolkits are assigned badges to indicate their adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>:
*   **Open Source Basic**: Allows for basic reuse (e.g., download, print copies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Open Source Champion**: Licensed with Creative Commons, permitting remixing and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Hero**: Provides editable files or code, making adaptation easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

This approach recognizes that the act of remixing and adapting fosters capacity within teams, which is often a limiting factor for [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

### Social Proof and Global Network
The Navigator addresses the desire for "social proof" when trying new [[innovation_tools_and_methods_for_public_service | methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Toolkits are connected to OPSI's case study platform, which contains hundreds of examples of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation in government]] with demonstrated [[impact_of_innovation_in_the_public_sector | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

The platform also connects users to OPSI's global network of over 1700 [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_organizations | public sector innovators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. This network allows for discussions, toolkit reviews, and peer support for those seeking advice or collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### Using the OPSI Toolkit Navigator
The Navigator's landing page organizes content by topics, actions, and connections to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

Users can navigate by:
*   **Topics**: Exploring disciplines or practices like "digital and technology transformation," which provide index articles on principles, guidance, typical methods, and considerations for public sector use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   **Actions**: Selecting specific "take action" steps, such as "design a new strategy," which offer guidance and relevant toolkit collections tailored to roles like policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
*   **Connecting to others**: Finding toolkits related to accessing expertise, team building, or setting up [[framework_for_innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation labs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
*   **Search**: Using keywords to find specific toolkits (e.g., "policy innovation") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.
*   **Curated Collections**: Accessing pre-filtered sets of toolkits, such as "game-based toolkits," "highly adaptable toolkits," or "starter toolkits" (which offer extensive guidance for beginners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

Individual toolkit pages provide quick overviews, publisher details, links to content and editable files, related disciplines, license information, country, and features (e.g., checklists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. Logged-in users can also mark toolkits as "used" or "saved" to their profiles for easy retrieval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

### Contributing to the Navigator
Users are encouraged to submit new toolkits that are freely accessible, relevant to the public sector context, and focus on stimulating action rather than just knowledge building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. All submissions are reviewed before publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

The OPSI Toolkit Navigator is an ongoing development, constantly seeking user feedback and potential partnerships to enhance its value to [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_organizations | public sector innovators]] worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

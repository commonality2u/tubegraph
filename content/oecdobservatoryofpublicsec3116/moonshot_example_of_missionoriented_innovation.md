[[mission_oriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is characterized as a type of innovation with a clear purpose driving the need for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It focuses on solving a specific challenge or societal problem that requires innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Moonshot Example

The "moonshot" — the endeavor to go to the moon — is cited as one of the most well-known examples of [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Key aspects of this mission:
*   **Clear Goal** There was a definitive objective: either the moon was reached, or it wasn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The end goal was to either touch the ground on the moon or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **System Alignment** Organizations like NASA established their entire system to fulfill this singular mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Innovation Outcomes**
    *   A significant amount of innovation occurred directly as a result of the moonshot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   Additionally, many different types of [[emergent_innovations_from_missionoriented_projects | innovations emerged as a side effect]] of this [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Purpose-Driven Innovation

Ultimately, [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission oriented innovation]] is fundamentally about purpose-driven innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It requires clear goals about the rationale for innovating in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. From such focused efforts, many new ideas can emerge, potentially offering future benefits connected to the primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

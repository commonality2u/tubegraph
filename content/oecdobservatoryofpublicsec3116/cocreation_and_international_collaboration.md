The OECD Innovation Playbook, a tool designed to translate the OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation into practice, serves as a prime example of [[missionoriented_approaches_and_cocreation | cocreation]] and international collaboration in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Developed by diverse countries, the Playbook aims to bridge the gap between good intentions and actual practices in public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Principles Driving Collaboration

The OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation, to which 43 countries have adhered, outlines five core principles, with several directly emphasizing collaboration and shared learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>:

*   **Cultivate New Partnerships and Involve Different Voices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>: It is essential to "go beyond the walls of the government" and rely on the wisdom and motivation of ecosystem stakeholders, ensuring everyone has a say in how innovation is created, implemented, and iterated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This principle mandates inclusivity in innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Diffuse Lessons and Share Practices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>: The Declaration stresses that there should be no monopolies of innovation, as innovation is inherently "sharable and built in partnership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This principle drives the sharing of experiences to learn from others and improve activities through collective contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Collaborative Development of the Playbook

The Innovation Playbook was [[cocreation_and_stakeholder_engagement_in_mission_setting | co-created]] by engaging actual users, ensuring it is user-centric and adaptable to various contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Initially, 12 countries were engaged in its [[cocreation_and_stakeholder_engagement_in_mission_setting | co-creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The process involved:

*   **Mockup Phase:** Working with a simple Word document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **First Iteration:** Improving the mockup to include tools and cases based on community suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Final Version:** A consolidated version, tested by users, and translated into national languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

This iterative approach, including prototyping and integrating feedback, was crucial for refining the tool and ensuring its applicability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

## National Experiences with International Collaboration

The experiences of countries like Sweden, Romania, and Chile highlight the importance and benefits of [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_sector_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] in public sector innovation:

### Sweden
Jonas Gumbal from Vinnova, Sweden, emphasized that the Ministry's signing of the Declaration provides legitimacy for complex innovation work in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The Declaration and Playbook act as a guiding framework to achieve the government's goal of being innovative and cooperative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Sweden was among the first to translate the Playbook into Swedish and adapt it for in-person workshops, based on insights from a prototype test with the city of Uppsala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. This adaptation led to a simplification of the material to better fit the Swedish audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Jonas noted that countries are "more alike than we might think," and cooperating around capability building helps avoid "reinventing the wheel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.

### Romania
Anca Pesco and Larissa Balak from The Innovation Lab in Romania explained that joining the Declaration introduced the relatively new concept of public sector innovation to their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. The [[cocreation_and_stakeholder_engagement_in_mission_setting | co-creation]] of the Innovation Playbook helped them understand and disseminate the Declaration's principles into concrete words and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. They found comfort in realizing that other countries faced similar challenges, which helped them become more resilient in explaining and sharing best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. Romania used the Playbook in a massive virtual session with 800 participants, demonstrating a commitment to "go beyond the walls of the Innovation lab" and reach public servants directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. They plan to use the Playbook to structure their future innovation strategy and integrate the digital tool into a new platform for interactions between public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

### Chile
Orlando Hus, Director of Laboratorio de Gobierno in Chile, highlighted that the Declaration provides a "common understanding" of public innovation and how to foster it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. Chile's signing of the Declaration in 2019 manifested its commitment to this agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. The government lab's services are aligned with the Declaration's principles, particularly regarding exploration, iteration, testing, and cultivating new partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. Chile has a Public Innovators Network with over 28,000 members from various sectors (Civil Society, Academia, Private Sector, Public Sector) that builds capabilities and provides tools for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. They also focus on diffusing lessons and sharing practices through their Public Innovation Index, which measures public service innovation capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. Chile is actively working with other Latin American countries (Peru, Colombia, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Brazil) to extend this index and foster a "more integrative way" of advancing public innovation across the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

## The Playbook as a Tool for Cross-Border Dialogue

The Playbook is not limited to internal projects; it also facilitates dialogue between countries. For example, countries as diverse as Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine have used this tool to initiate conversations about shared challenges and opportunities for [[crossborder_collaboraiton_in_public_sector_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] around public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. This collaborative approach allows countries to identify shared challenges, take stock of resources and weaknesses, and collectively define a way forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.

## Evolution Towards a Living, Interactive Platform

The development of the digital Playbook version, a collaboration involving Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Luxembourg, Spain, and Sweden, reflects a commitment to keeping the tool a "living creature" rather than a fossilized document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. This new platform aims to be engaging, playful, and interactive, highlighting [[collaboration_and_communication_innovations | cross-linkages]] to other resources and allowing for continuous updates and manageability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>. It is designed to be accessible and usable for all users, regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>. This ongoing [[collaboration_and_peer_support_in_innovation | collaboration]] ensures the Playbook remains a relevant and dynamic resource for fostering public sector innovation globally.

The Innovation Playbook is a digital tool designed to translate the OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation into practical application, bridging the gap between intentions and actual practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It was originally [[cocreation with stakeholders|co-created]] by diverse countries to help apply the Declaration in distinct contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation

The OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation is a high-level instrument providing guidance to governments on how to steer and promote innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Created over five years ago, 43 countries have already adhered to it, signifying its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Key Principles of the Declaration
The Declaration is built on five simple principles:
1.  **Embrace and Nurture Innovation within the Public Sector:** Providing high-level sponsorship is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
2.  **Encourage and Equip All Public Servants to Innovate:** This involves ensuring skills and incentives are in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
3.  **Cultivate New [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation|Partnerships]] and Involve Different Voices:** It emphasizes going beyond government walls and relying on the wisdom and motivation of [[cocreation with stakeholders|ecosystem stakeholders]], ensuring everyone has a say in how innovation is created, implemented, and iterated, thus promoting inclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
4.  **Support Exploration, Iteration, and Testing:** This means testing before implementing, learning from errors, and managing risks in controlled environments using robust methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
5.  **Diffuse Lessons and Share Practices:** Innovation is inherently shareable and built in [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation|partnership]], aiming to avoid "monopolies of innovation" and promoting mutual learning and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## [[cocreation process with OECD|Cocreation]] in Developing the Playbook

The Playbook was [[cocreation with stakeholders|co-created]] by engaging actual users and diverse countries in its co-design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Initially, 12 countries were deeply involved in developing a mockup version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This collaborative effort allowed for the integration of suggestions from the community, leading to a more robust version that included tools and cases not originally anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The final version was tested, with participants providing valuable feedback that informed improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The digital version is a direct result of these tests and feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

## [[international_collaboration_on_innovation|International Collaboration]] and its Impact

[[international_collaboration_on_innovation|International collaboration]] has been fundamental to the Playbook's development and application. It allows countries to rely on the accumulated experience of the [[international_collaboration_on_innovation|global community]] of public sector innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Benefits of Collaboration
*   **Legitimacy and Mandate:** For countries like Sweden, the Declaration signed by the ministry provides legitimacy and a mandate for complex innovation work in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Common Understanding:** The Declaration offers a common understanding of public innovation and how to foster it, which is seen as a universal approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
*   **Awareness and Adoption:** In Romania, the Playbook has been critical in introducing and disseminating the concept of public sector innovation, helping to raise awareness among political leaders and public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **Shared [[challenges_and_strategies_for_global_collaboration|Challenges]] and Learning:** The [[cocreation process with OECD|co-creation process]] revealed that many countries face similar [[challenges_and_strategies_for_global_collaboration|challenges]], fostering a sense of shared experience and allowing for mutual learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. This minimizes the need to "reinvent the wheel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.
*   **Adaptability and Customization:** The Playbook is designed to be adaptable to different contexts, allowing countries to translate and customize materials to fit local needs and audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Examples of [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation|International Collaboration]]

*   **Sweden:** Vinnova, Sweden's innovation agency, was the first to translate the Playbook into Swedish and develop in-person workshop materials, simplifying it for the local audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. This highlighted the importance of local language and user-centric adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Romania:** The Innovation Lab in Romania translated the Playbook and applied it in massive virtual sessions, engaging hundreds of public servants to build an emerging community of innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. They plan to integrate the digital Playbook into a new platform for interactions between public servants on innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.
*   **Chile:** Laboratorio de Gobierno (Government Lab) in Chile, an international reference point for government innovation, uses the Declaration as a guideline for its services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. They foster innovation through an agile consultancy service based on exploration, iteration, and testing, and cultivate [[public_and_private_collaboration_in_innovation|partnerships]] by involving different voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. Chile has a public innovators network with over 28,000 members from various sectors, including civil society, academia, private sector, and public sector, to build capabilities and provide tools for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. They also launched a Public Innovation School for skills development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

## [[Crossborder government collaboration and innovation|Cross-border Collaboration]] on Challenges

The Playbook has facilitated dialogues between countries, like Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, to discuss shared [[challenges_and_strategies_for_global_collaboration|challenges]] and opportunities for [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation|cross-border collaboration]] around public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>. This allows them to identify common issues, assess resources and weaknesses, and collectively define a way forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.

### Public Innovation Index in Chile
Chile's Public Innovation Index, created in 2019 with the Inter-American Development Bank, measures the innovation capabilities of public services, focusing on central government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. It assesses 10 capabilities, including structure, legal framework, skills, digital capabilities, openness to users and other institutions, and established innovation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. The index provides evidence-based measurements and informs development programs, including a mentoring network and the Public Innovation School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. Chile is working with other Latin American countries to extend this index regionally, aiming for a standardized way to measure government innovation progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

## Future of the Digital Playbook

The future of the Playbook is envisioned as an interactive, updatable, and dynamic platform. Key drivers for this digital evolution include:
*   **Engagement and Playfulness:** Creating an engaging and playful interactive version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>.
*   **Cross-linkages:** Highlighting existing resources and making them accessible through a single point of entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.
*   **Updatability and Manageability:** Streamlining the process for updates and changes, moving away from static PDF versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensuring it is accessible and usable for all users, regardless of location, at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   **Automatic Reporting:** Providing a way to automatically produce systematized and exportable results from user interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>.

A working group involving colleagues from Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Luxembourg, Spain, and Sweden is actively involved in identifying features, pretesting structures, and refining the digital version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. This ensures the Playbook remains a "living creature" rather than a fossilized document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>.

The conversation on "inclusive services and building trust in public institutions" at the Government Beyond Recovery conference highlights crucial challenges in `[[digital_transformation_in_government | digital government transformation]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The core challenge is how to leverage digital opportunities to design and deliver services while ensuring they meet the expectations of final users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This requires services to be inclusive and to build trust in public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Key Challenges Identified

Several recurring `[[challenges_and_strategies_for_digital_transformation_in_government | challenges]]` in `[[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | public sector digital transformation]]` were highlighted by experts and a public poll:

### 1. User-Centricity and Inclusion
*   **Balancing Digital with Traditional Access:** A primary concern is that a "digital by default" mindset can limit thinking, leading to disconnected experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Services must support multiple channels, including traditional physical access, for those who cannot or do not want to use digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   In Slovenia, traditionally excellent physical administrative services meant citizens were "spoiled," which backfired during COVID-19 when these units became inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   In France, a large portion of the population is uncomfortable with digital services, necessitating the multiplication of physical support places, especially in less urban areas, to accompany people and improve their digital skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. It's crucial not to expect everyone to be comfortable with digital; choosing not to use digital should be a liberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
    *   Portugal emphasizes providing alternative channels like telephone or face-to-face assistance through a network of "citizen shops" and "citizen spaces" where trained mediators help citizens use digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>. Mobile units ("mobile cities and spaces") also extend this reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **Citizen Skills and Capabilities:** The top challenge identified in a poll was the skills and capabilities of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Many citizens still lack digital identity or are uncomfortable accessing advanced `[[digital_transformation_and_egovernance | e-services]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   Slovenia plans to introduce a new electronic identity card to provide all citizens "an effective ticket to the digital world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   Efforts include special digital vouchers for e-skills and introducing computer science in schools for long-term investment in citizen skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.
*   **Accessibility Needs:** Ensuring services are accessible to all, including people with disabilities, is a constant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

### 2. Internal Government Operations and Culture
*   **Silos and Lack of Collaboration:** "Different silos in government that operate services in different places" and "lack of collaboration inside government to solve whole problems" were significant challenges identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. Services often do not stop at departmental boundaries, leading to disconnected user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
    *   The UK's single domain, Gov.uk, simplifies government by forcing departments to work together and collaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Skills and Capabilities of Public Servants:** If public servants lack digital skills and understanding of `[[agile_and_digital_transformation_in_government | agile ways of working]]`, government cannot react quickly enough to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
    *   Systematic improvement of knowledge and skills of service providers through administration academies is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Organizational Mindset and Culture:** Shifting the digital mindset, encompassing skills, `[[agile_and_digital_transformation_in_government | agile working]]`, leadership, and collaboration, is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Remote working during the pandemic highlighted difficulties in some departments due to a lack of suitable tools for civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Legislative and Regulatory Barriers:** Existing legislation may hinder digital-friendly approaches, requiring fine-tuning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Procurement Processes:** Influencing the market of suppliers to meet user needs and work effectively for government is a critical aspect of `[[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.

### 3. Data and Service Design
*   **Access to Data:** Better access to data is needed to join up services effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Difficulties in getting access to data were noted as a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Data Governance and Trust:** While the use of data is vital for digital services, ensuring legal compliance, ethical acceptability, transparency, and respecting privacy (e.g., GDPR standards) is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Overarching strategic data management covering open, closed, and personal data is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. Mitigating concerns over storage and sharing of personal data requires clear explanations, transparency of use, and trusted external auditing institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.
*   **Inconsistent Multi-Channel Performance:** Users' digital journeys are often interrupted due to inconsistent multi-channel performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Communication:** Simplifying service language and communication to be accessible and understandable by everyone is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. This includes for people with disabilities or those less digitally literate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.
*   **Complexity of Digital Services:** The perception that digital sometimes adds complexity rather than simplifying operations for both users and service providers is a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. However, this is largely attributed to poor design or methods rather than digital itself; properly designed services should hide underlying complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:56">[01:21:56]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges for the Future

To navigate these `[[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_sector_digital_transformation | challenges]]`, governments are focusing on:
*   **Systematic Approaches:** Moving beyond emergency responses towards `[[role_of_digital_transformation_in_public_administration | systematic thinking]]` that plans and implements forward-looking `[[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.
*   **User Research and Co-creation:** Deepening understanding of user needs through extensive research, talking to citizens, and confronting services with specific user groups (e.g., farmers) to ensure services are useful and well-designed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:03">[02:10:03]</a>.
*   **Standardization and Components:** Developing toolkits of thoroughly tested building blocks (e.g., notification platforms, identity checks) and documented design patterns to accelerate service development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

The future-readiness of ambitious national and international missions is a critical topic, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. The discussion centers on how to commit to bold, long-term goals while remaining agile and adaptable in an uncertain future, ensuring that the benefits extend across generations.

### The Imperative for Future-Ready Missions

The conference highlights the need for new missions, particularly those emerging from the COVID-19 crisis, to prevent future global crises [00:00:26], [00:00:41], [00:00:45]. A key challenge is making these missions long-term and agile, avoiding "lock-in" to specific solutions for an uncertain future [00:00:55], [00:01:07], [00:01:12]. A poll conducted during the session revealed that only 17% of organizations have mechanisms to make their missions future-ready, with 41% stating they do not and 43% being unsure [00:27:18]-[00:28:03]. The areas perceived as most uncertain and influenced by continuous change are climate challenges (47%) and societal challenges (40%) [00:28:22], [00:28:41].

### Incorporating Future Generations and Intergenerational Justice

A core aspect of future-ready missions is ensuring [[youth_engagement_in_decision_making | youth engagement in decision making]] and promoting intergenerational justice. The concern is that future generations, who will be most impacted by current decisions, often lack representation [01:00:54], [01:03:00].

#### Youth Engagement in Mission Development
*   **European Commission Initiatives:** The European Commission's five new missions (conquering cancer, climate resilient Europe, restoring oceans and waters, 100 climate neutral cities, and caring for soil) [00:04:47] specifically considered the importance of youth from the start, incorporating strong youth themes into citizen engagement activities, including work with the European Youth Parliament [01:08:30], [01:08:45]. These missions aim to develop strong connections with the European Solidarity Corps to support young people's involvement in community-based projects [01:09:03], [01:09:17].
*   **Citizen Engagement and Buy-in:** The development of the EU missions emphasized connecting with citizens to ensure buy-in and ownership, crucial for long-term commitment [00:31:39], [00:31:41].
*   **Future-Oriented Mindsets:** Young entrepreneurs, particularly those under 25, are already operating with a "different mindset," being "born circular" and inherently focused on sustainable products and services [01:01:50]-[01:02:09]. This perspective offers hope for future solutions.

#### Addressing Intergenerational Fairness
*   **Long-Term Policy:** The concept of [[mission_setting_and_policy_making | mission setting and policy making]] should align with discussions on intergenerational fairness and building long-term institutions, extending beyond a single political term of office [00:46:06], [00:46:09], [00:46:17].
*   **Financial Accountability:** There's a growing bipartisan interest among political leaders in assessing how investments (e.g., post-COVID recovery funds) impact and indebt future generations, ensuring fairness in who benefits and who pays [00:46:40], [00:46:48].
*   **Global Agendas:** Reports like "Our Common Agenda" by the UN Secretary-General indicate a global wave of thinking about governance ecosystems that enable long-term vision [00:47:09], [00:47:27]. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are seen as a national strategy for future generations, serving as an "ultimate mission" to create inspiring, secure, wealthy, and fair nations [01:07:33]-[01:07:51].

### Foresight and Dynamic Mission Development

[[mission_setting_and_implementation_strategies | Mission setting and implementation strategies]] must integrate foresight to remain flexible and adaptive:
*   **Uncoupling from Present Problems:** Introducing foresight into discussions about major challenges helps to "uncouple" from today's problems and obstacles, fostering discussions about future needs and opportunities. This opens up innovative spaces for new ideas [01:03:14]-[01:03:52].
*   **Methods of Foresight:**
    *   **Scenario Planning:** Used to reframe future contexts, expose strategic blind zones, and explore how the public sector might evolve over 10-15 years [02:00:08], [01:04:35].
    *   **Future Personas:** Help integrate future users into the design process, ensuring user-centricity beyond current demographics [02:00:50], [01:05:08].
    *   **Analyzing Driving Forces:** Identifying and analyzing forces for change and their potential impacts is crucial [00:20:36].
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** While broad mission statements (e.g., net zero by 2050) tend to remain stable, lower-level objectives require constant adaptation [00:52:46], [00:52:58]. This necessitates strong monitoring, robust governance structures, and portfolio approaches to projects [00:53:07], [00:53:14].
*   **Role of Foresight Practitioners:** The next generation of foresight practitioners, often young people, offer a valuable resource, bringing systematic ways of thinking about the future to transform communities [01:06:09]-[01:06:38].

### Challenges and Collaborative Solutions

Several challenges exist in maintaining the focus on youth and intergenerational justice:
*   **Political Commitment:** It's difficult to ask political leaders to commit to missions extending 10 or more years into the future, potentially beyond their term in office [00:31:10], [00:46:17]. Strategies include emphasizing broad agreement, citizen buy-in, and establishing clear decision points for steering missions [00:31:27]-[00:32:05].
*   **Incumbent Bias:** Ensuring that [[collaborative_governance_and_breaking_silos in mission implementation | collaborative governance and breaking silos in mission implementation]] and dialogue processes overcome the bias of existing players and allow for the emergence of new businesses and partners is vital [00:39:02], [00:39:19].
*   **Breaking Silos:** Governments often operate in "topical silos" (e.g., green missions versus well-being) [01:09:58]. Missions should not be purely technological but integrate behavioral and social dimensions to ensure smooth transitions and holistic well-being [01:11:01]-[01:12:05]. The integration of social science and humanities is crucial [01:04:07], [01:14:02].
*   **Learning Mindset:** Denmark's approach emphasizes co-creating roadmaps with the entire ecosystem (companies, public administration, investors, researchers) and fostering a "learning mindset" for the partnership [00:36:34]-[00:38:11]. This allows for adaptation and courageous decision-making [00:38:18], [01:24:19].
*   **Handling "Failure":** The term "failure" in missions is complex; it's rarely binary [01:16:16]. Instead, it's about learning, adapting, and sometimes reforming activities rather than completely cutting them [01:20:16]-[01:21:32]. The side effects of missions, even if the primary goal isn't met, can yield significant [[emergent_innovations_from_missionoriented_projects | emergent innovations from missionoriented projects]] (e.g., internet from Cold War-era missions) [01:17:48]-[01:18:07]. Success depends on designing processes for deep and effective participation, representation, and voice [01:05:33], [01:19:17].

Ultimately, the goal is to drive transformation at speed, recognizing that there's no single blueprint for success [01:22:05], [01:24:52]. It requires courage to do things differently and at a necessary pace [01:24:33], [01:24:45]. The emphasis is on building trust, extending ownership, and continuously monitoring progress through flexible review systems [00:54:36], [01:16:51], [01:25:56].

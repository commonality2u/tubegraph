## The Imperative of Future-Ready Missions
The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the need to define new missions to prevent future global crises [00:00:26]. These missions must be approached with agility and iterative methods to avoid "lock-in" within an uncertain future [00:01:07]. Experience from the past two years underscores the importance of adaptation [00:01:57]. The OECD's [[impact_and_strategic_orientation_of_innovation_missions | Missions Action Lab]] specifically focuses on implementing missions iteratively and in an agile manner [00:02:52].

### Challenges in Mission Readiness
A poll conducted during the conference revealed significant concerns about the future-readiness of current organizational missions:
*   Only 17% of participants reported their organizations have mechanisms to make missions future-ready [00:27:18].
*   41% indicated no such mechanisms are in place, meaning goals are set without dynamic processes to check their future fit [00:27:36].
*   A concerning 43% were unaware of their organizations' future preparedness regarding missions [00:27:55].

Furthermore, the poll identified areas where missions face the highest uncertainty and continuous change:
*   [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_implementing_missionoriented_climate_strategies | Climate challenges]] (47%) due to immense complexity and interconnectedness [00:28:22].
*   Societal challenges (40%), as new technologies and social contexts rapidly change lifestyles and interactions [00:28:41].
*   Economic challenges (25%) and health challenges (15%) [00:29:20].

## Committing to Ambitious Missions
Senior leaders require specific knowledge and frameworks to commit to bold missions given their long-term nature and potential political changes [00:30:00].

### European Commission's Approach
The European Commission emphasizes several factors for gaining commitment:
*   **Strong Agreement & Robust Process** The importance of mission goals is stressed through broad agreement across all policy areas, demonstrating a robust development process [00:31:24].
*   **Citizen Engagement** Connecting with citizens fosters buy-in and ownership [00:31:39].
*   [[tools_and_frameworks_for_evaluating_mission_impact | **Monitoring & Decision Points**]] Missions include decision points and an analytical framework to monitor performance, allowing for steering and adaptation without requiring perpetual commitment [00:32:05].
*   **Scalability of Investments** Missions, like the EU's Horizon Europe program, are designed to extend beyond initial funding frameworks, demonstrating a credible path for building investments from diverse sources over time [00:33:34].

### Denmark's Green Transition Missions
Denmark, a leader in [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_implementing_missionoriented_climate_strategies | climate mission]] and [[impact_and_strategic_orientation_of_innovation_missions | mission-driven innovation]], highlights practical strategies for commitment:
*   **Co-creation of Roadmaps** Partnerships involving the entire ecosystem (companies, public administration, private investors, researchers) are insisted upon to co-create roadmaps, ensuring broad alignment [00:36:11]. This enables diverse financial institutions and partners to identify their roles [00:37:05].
*   **Bridging Policy and Reality** Significant effort is spent on aligning overarching targets with practical implementation, actively managing the gap between policy and real-world action [00:37:30].
*   **Flexible Financing & Learning Mindset** Financing models and governance must allow for a learning mindset, recognizing that the exact path in five years is unknown. This adaptability prevents missions from becoming closed off and encourages integration of new partners [00:37:49].
*   **Counteracting Incumbent Bias** To avoid incumbent bias, Denmark challenges itself by including partners with completely different perspectives on mission-driven innovation. They also emphasize international collaboration and strongly encourage the integration of social sciences and humanities into technological missions to address consumer behavior and public acceptance [00:39:53].
*   **Political Engagement** Regular meetings with senior government officials make political barriers visible, helping identify necessary policy changes for successful implementation. This direct connection between real-life challenges and policy levels increases success [00:40:49].

## Flexible and Agile Implementation

### Incorporating Foresight
Strategic foresight is crucial for future-proofing missions and allowing for dynamic evolution [00:48:56].
*   **Shifting Focus** Foresight methods, such as scenario planning, help move discussions away from current problems and obstacles to focus on future needs and possibilities, opening up innovative spaces [01:03:14].
*   **Addressing Generational Gaps** By considering future personas and contexts, foresight helps overcome the generational gap between current employees/leaders and future users, leading to more inclusive solutions [01:04:04].
*   **Examples** Norway's use of scenario planning for innovation white papers and exploration of "blind zones" and future personas in local innovation efforts demonstrate practical applications [01:04:36].

### Governance and Adaptability
*   **Nested Structure** While broad mission statements (e.g., net zero by 2050) remain stable, adaptation is crucial at lower-level objectives. This requires robust monitoring, strong governance structures, and a staged-gate approach [00:52:41].
*   **Portfolio Strategy** Implementing a portfolio of projects that collectively contribute to the mission, rather than individual projects, allows for tuning and adaptation [00:53:14].
*   **Systematic Reviews** The EU Commission incorporates stringent review processes (e.g., annual committee reports, legislative reviews, interim evaluations) to monitor progress and ensure missions evolve [00:54:58]. These reviews should ideally have a future perspective, not just a backward look [00:55:52].
*   **Courage and Pace** Denmark emphasizes courage in doing things differently and maintaining pace, acknowledging that there's no single blueprint for success. They embrace a trial-and-error approach, recognizing that methods will inevitably change over time [01:24:45].

### Breaking Silos and Building Alliances
*   **Interdisciplinary Integration** To address complex challenges like climate change and well-being, missions need to go beyond purely technological or scientific solutions and integrate behavioral, social, and humanistic dimensions [01:10:50]. This requires breaking down topical silos within governments [01:09:58].
*   **Unexpected Allies** Seeking out unexpected allies, such as parliamentarians who champion bipartisan agendas or international supreme audit bodies, can help drive long-term institutional change [00:56:15].
*   **Intergenerational Fairness** Debates around intergenerational fairness and building long-term institutions align with mission approaches. Governments are beginning to assess investments for their benefits and costs across current and future generations [00:46:06].
*   **Youth Engagement** Integrating youth perspectives and energy is vital. Initiatives like working with the European Youth Parliament and connecting with the European Solidarity Corps (for green deal missions) aim to foster youth involvement in community-based projects [01:08:30]. Designing processes for deep and effective participation and representation, such as Japan's public dialogues, allows for the voices of "not yet born" generations to be included [01:05:33].

## Handling Mission Setbacks and "Failure"

The concept of "failure" in missions is complex and not binary [01:16:16].
*   **Learning from Setbacks** Given the relatively short track record of many mission-oriented policies, learning from setbacks is essential. Reflectivity and robust evaluation are critical [01:19:55].
*   **Exit Strategies** Implementing an "exit strategy" can soften the blow of a mission not meeting its primary objective, preventing a brutal backlash. For example, Norway's "moon landing mission" on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in 2007-2008 initially faltered but retained core activities. Years later, these efforts resurfaced as a new large-scale CCS mission called "Northern Light," demonstrating that activities can be reformed and repurposed to reduce sunk costs [01:20:41].
*   **Side Effects and Unintended Innovations** Historically, missions (like those during the Cold War) have often led to [[side_effects_and_unintended_innovations_from_mission_driven_projects | unexpected technological advancements and side effects]] (e.g., the internet, smartphones) even if their primary objectives were not fully met [01:17:45].
*   **Inclusivity to Prevent Failure** A mission is set up for failure if crucial stakeholders, particularly those who understand the second and third-order impacts of disruptions (social, economic, political, beyond just technological), are not included in the initial design and ongoing processes [01:19:10]. Bringing diverse voices into the room is key to anticipating and mitigating potential negative consequences [01:19:19].
*   **Culture of Cooperation** Cultivating a "culture of cooperation" where blame is not attached allows for experimentation and acceptance that some aspects will prosper while others may not. Performance measurement systems need to be attuned to this nuanced reality [01:16:57].

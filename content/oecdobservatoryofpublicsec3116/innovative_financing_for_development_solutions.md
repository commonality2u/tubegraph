The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences are projected to increase poverty and drive further inequality worldwide, highlighting the need for innovations that benefit the poorest and most vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Reports from the OECD, such as the *States of Fragility* report and the *Global Outlook on Financing for Sustainable Development*, underline this dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

A poll conducted during a session on "Uncovering Inequality: The Space for Innovation in Developing World" revealed that while 88% of participants believe innovations can provide an effective response to the challenge of leaving no one behind, a significant majority (61% disagree, 19% strongly disagree) feel that governments and their partners are not doing enough to enable innovation for sustainable development in light of the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This indicates a "huge need" to foster innovation to address the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## The Role of Governments in Funding Innovation

Governments have a critical role to play in fostering an enabling environment for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Instead of controlling, they should coordinate, facilitate, and nurture innovation, acting as "steerers" rather than "rowers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

One way to achieve this is by creating an innovation ecosystem. For example, Malaysia has established a Global Innovation Center, which provides an "innovation sandbox" with significant funding for local innovators, along with mentorship and matching grants for social enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This extends beyond Malaysia, using a regional approach in ASEAN to allow social enterprises to penetrate the ASEAN market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

Innovation fundamentally requires funding, regulations, and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Government procurement can also be a powerful incentive for aligning efforts and promoting solutions to identified problems, such as the SDGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>. Governments can also incentivize private sector participation in "nation building" through budget allocations and incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Innovative Financing

A significant constraint for innovators is money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. The current economic recession has led to enormous outflows of private capital and foreign direct investment from low- and middle-income countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. To address this, there's a need to foster innovation through both public and private sectors, attracting capital flows into areas like global health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

Amy Lynn of USAID's Center for Innovation and Impact highlights that supporting social entrepreneurs requires more than just grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. While technical assistance and catalytic grant funding are important, there's a viable pathway to bring in investors, possibly at slightly sub-market rates, to grow the "resourcing pie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. USAID is working with its Development Finance Corporation (DFC) counterparts to explore co-financing opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

Jamila Mahmood also noted that the pandemic creates a multi-sectoral need for innovation, including in the financial space, as all sectors are impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. Malaysia, for instance, is experimenting with Islamic social financing, like the sukuk model and Islamic bonds, which have been oversubscribed and are being used to empower local women and communities through livelihood development and health initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.

### The Role of International Community

The international community must do its share to promote locally led innovation, which is often less costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Donors need to invest in supporting local structures that drive innovation and change within communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. This requires taking risks, as donors don't typically like to take them, but locally driven innovations depend on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. As Amy Lynn summarized, the most patient capital (grant capital, which has a negative 100% financial return) can be impactful when combined with return-seeking capital to lower the risk for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. This "blending of capital" can help grow the pie and add more money to close the SDG financing gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>.

### Private Sector Involvement

The private sector plays a huge role in fostering innovation, recognizing that it can be economically sensible, not just altruistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. Traditional business models in the West often involved expensive R&D and high margins for affluent customers, with trickle-down effects to lower-income groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. This approach needs to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>.

Instead, the private sector should embrace "frugal innovation," which focuses on doing more with less resources to make solutions highly affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. While this might mean "wafer-thin margins," profitability comes from reaching large numbers of people with unmet needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>. Large companies are learning to do things "faster, better, cheaper," as seen with the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines by pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and AstraZeneca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.

Notably, these large companies often partner with agile startups to develop early-stage ideas, leveraging the startups' innovation and the large companies' resources for clinical trials and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>. This dynamic highlights the potential of partnerships between governments, corporations, and citizens/startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. The ideal dynamic involves governments creating platforms and incentives to bring these players together to solve major problems like the SDGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.

## Looking Ahead

The crisis has underscored that innovation is an important lever for unprecedented challenges and that new tools and approaches are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. It has also revealed that development cooperation should look beyond traditional sectors and silos, considering the holistic impacts of crises on various areas like health, economy, and livelihoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.

It is crucial to expand the conversation around innovation to include diverse voices, especially local innovators and female innovators, who may not be on the traditional radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>. By actively seeking and examining how decisions are made, the goal is to create an "inclusive innovation environment" that will yield the best ideas and the most impact in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.

The Development Cooperation Directorate at the OECD is committed to supporting this effort through a new, scaled-up program of work on [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation for development]], aiming to mobilize the full potential of development cooperation to support and enable innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

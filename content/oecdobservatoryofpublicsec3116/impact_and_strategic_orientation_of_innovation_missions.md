This article explores the strategic orientation and potential impact of [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] policies, drawing insights from various organizations and countries.

## Defining [[missionoriented_innovation | Mission-Oriented Innovation]]

The OECD defines [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] policy as a coordinated package of policy and regulatory measures specifically tailored to mobilize science, technology, and innovation. The primary goal is to address significant societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. This package of measures is not an individual action but spans several stages of the innovation cycle, utilizing diverse policy instruments (supply-side, demand-side, regulatory, top-down, bottom-up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. It crosses different policy fields, sectors, and disciplines, all targeting ambitious, bold, concrete, and measurable goals to be met within a defined timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Three main dimensions characterize [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]]: strategic orientation, policy coordination, and policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Strategic Orientation

A core aspect of [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] is its strategic orientation, which involves defining and aligning efforts towards specific, grand challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Challenges in Defining Missions

The main challenge in strategic orientation is creating broad consensus on selected societal challenges and translating them into clear, bold, and addressable objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This requires legitimacy and can involve questions such as:
*   How to create customized missions for specific situations, acknowledging that the "right" mission is context-dependent in terms of scope, depth, granularity, focus, and boldness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   How to secure and balance the involvement of a wide range of stakeholders, including politicians, experts, policymakers, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   The risk of "delusion" or "inflation" of the mission as more actors are brought on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Specific Considerations for Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)

In LMICs, several unique factors influence strategic orientation:
*   **Localization and Ownership:** The degree to which a mission is localized and genuinely owned by national actors (government, cross-society, social movements) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. External influences on mission formulation are a significant consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   **Capability Reflection:** Missions must reflect the capabilities and capacities of the national innovation ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. This often means that technology transfer models need to be an integral part of the mission, unlike in high-income countries where the domestic innovation ecosystem is generally assumed to suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## [[impact_of_mission_oriented_innovation_on_society | Impact of Mission-Oriented Innovation]]

Beyond the challenges, [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] policies offer significant benefits and pathways to impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.

### Facilitating Collective Action and Systemic Change

[[missionoriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] policies provide a dedicated and tailored space for collective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This space is adaptable to each area and institutional setting, allowing for:
*   **Co-creation:** Objectives and targets can be co-created among diverse stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Tailored Governance:** Specific governance structures can be set up to manage complex, multi-actor initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Intentional Policy Mixes:** The approach facilitates the design and implementation of intentional mixes of policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

Despite being a challenging systemic policy approach, [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] is designed to be developed gradually through experimentation and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Countries are seen to start with early steps and build upon existing structures rather than attempting to implement everything at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Examples of Potential and Achieved Impact

*   **Norway's Pilot-E Scheme:** This scheme, developed organically through inter-agency collaboration, targets the development of technologies, from R&D to full solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. An example of its impact is the development and operation of electric ferries to reduce carbon emissions in Norway's fjords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. This "accelerated mission" concept is now being scaled up to other areas like healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.
*   **CSIRO, Australia:** As Australia's national science agency, CSIRO's [[missionoriented_innovation | missions]] are coordinated packages of projects mobilizing science, technology, and innovation to address well-defined objectives related to societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. These missions span the innovation cycle from research and development to market deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. CSIRO aims to "crowd in" existing financial and other resources from industry, government, research, and civil society to scale missions and achieve impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Examples include the hydrogen industry mission (targeting $2 H2 per kilo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, future protein (growing Australia's protein industry by $10 billion by 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>, trusted Agri-foods (increasing food exports by $10 billion by 2030) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>, and drought resilience (reducing negative impacts by 30% by 2030) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **UNDP Vietnam:** The UNDP's deep demonstration initiative, including the accelerator lab network, works to address complex, fast-moving social-environmental challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. Their focus on Vietnam's transition to a circular economy highlights the need to move beyond single-point, short-term solutions and transform economic logics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. The UNDP emphasizes leveraging existing resources and addressing challenges like plastic waste by understanding underlying drivers and dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. They view the circular economy transition as an "emergency" similar to COVID-19 response, requiring rapid, agile, and silo-breaking government action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:30">[01:25:30]</a>, and as a way to future-proof Vietnam by building resilience to future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:25">[01:26:25]</a>.

### Implementation Challenges Affecting Impact

Even with strong strategic orientation, the practical [[governance_and_implementation_of_innovation_missions | governance and implementation of innovation missions]] presents significant hurdles that can hinder their intended impact:
*   **"Projectification" vs. Systemic Change:** The tendency for work to be framed as short-term projects rather than long-term systemic change, especially accentuated in international development cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. This affects securing long-term commitment and enabling investment in competing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Formal Barriers:** Scaling up successful bottom-up initiatives can expose significant differences in agency cultures and ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. Even small formal issues (e.g., publicizing applicant names) can become difficult as political involvement and "prestige" increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact:** It's challenging to accurately measure the impact of different initiatives, especially when objectives include diverse factors like greenhouse gas reduction and competitiveness, which are difficult to standardize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.
*   **Balancing Focus and Agility:** Maintaining focus on a defined roadmap while remaining agile and adaptive to a changing world is a persistent challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. The ability to stop underperforming projects both legally and culturally is often lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Stakeholder Engagement and Movement Building:** Ensuring involvement of all stakeholders is difficult, with "battling" sometimes occurring, particularly among researchers seeking funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>. Successful implementation often requires creating a broad movement and local engagement, which can be underestimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sectoral Coordination:** Bringing together different government departments and ministries around a shared mission, breaking down existing silos and overcoming misaligned incentives, is a core challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>.
*   **Donor and Funding Constraints:** In international development, donors are often bound by project-based design and implementation mechanisms, which can hinder the flexibility needed for adaptive, mission-oriented approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>.
*   **Integrating Demand-Side Policies:** A significant challenge is combining science policy with more demand-side policies and regulations to ensure that technological innovations translate into real-world solutions and are not just "fantastic technology ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Missionoriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] offers a powerful framework for tackling complex societal challenges by providing a structured, collaborative space for innovation. However, realizing its full [[impact_of_mission_oriented_innovation_on_society | impact on society]] requires navigating intricate strategic and implementation challenges related to consensus-building, cross-sectoral coordination, adaptive governance, and sustained commitment, particularly in diverse national and international contexts. Organizations like the OECD, through initiatives such as the Mission Action Lab, aim to support policymakers in addressing these practical challenges and fostering effective implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.

The "Government Aftershock" initiative was a global learning exercise aimed at understanding how governments can adapt and improve in the wake of the [[government_response_to_the_covid19_crisis | COVID-19 pandemic]]. This collaborative effort involved over 60 stakeholders in co-design processes, leading to more than 65 events worldwide and engaging over 5,500 participants [00:00:36]. The core questions guiding this initiative were: "what to leave behind, what to keep, and what to do differently given what we've learned" from the crisis [00:00:57]. The discussions revealed key insights into the workings of government and where it needs to head next [00:01:27].

## A Reimagined Government: Core Beliefs and Principles

The Center for Public Impact (CPI), a not-for-profit foundation founded by the Boston Consulting Group, contributed significantly to the "Government Aftershock" dialogues. Their mission is to "reimagine government so that it works for everyone" [00:02:49]. They found that an emerging vision for a reimagined government embraces complexity, relationship building, and experimentation for learning [00:02:59].

The [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | COVID-19 crisis]] sharply highlighted the necessity for governments to operate differently [00:05:06]. Historically, debates on public service reform focused on *what* government should do, *how* services should be structured or tracked, or *how* decisions should be made [00:05:13]. However, the damaged relationship between government and citizens indicates insufficient emphasis on *how* government should **be** â€“ referring to the beliefs and principles driving government action [00:05:25].

A new vision for government is emerging, based on three core beliefs [00:05:46]:
1.  Most societal challenges are complex in nature [00:05:49].
2.  The quality of human relationships is paramount [00:05:55].
3.  Progress is best achieved through experimentation and continuous learning [00:06:01].

These beliefs give rise to principles guiding the future of government, especially as leaders work to rebuild a [[postpandemic_government_challenges_and_strategies | post-COVID society]]. These principles include [00:06:17]:
*   Thinking systematically but acting locally [00:06:20].
*   Sharing power with those best placed to act [00:06:21].
*   Challenging unnecessary hierarchy and collaborating across boundaries [00:06:27].
*   Seeking out and building on strengths [00:06:32].
*   Championing the voices of those least heard [00:06:36].
*   Optimizing for learning rather than control [00:06:40].

The [[impact_of_covid19_on_governmentcitizen_relationships | COVID-19 recovery]] presents a powerful opportunity to bridge the gap between government and people, thereby reimagining government for the benefit of all [00:06:48].

## Key Insights and Themes

Preliminary analysis from the "Government Aftershock" discussions highlighted several key areas where the [[impact_of_pandemic_on_government_practice | pandemic impacted government practice]] and where change is needed:

### What to Keep, Leave Behind, and Start Doing
Participants offered insights on what governments should continue, cease, or begin doing [00:08:40]:

*   **Keep Doing**:
    *   **Collective Learning & Cross-sectoral Collaboration**: Initiatives like "Government Aftershock" themselves, fostering community and learning journeys, are crucial [00:08:54]. The year saw significant outreach and cross-sectoral collaboration, with a breakdown of silos within and across governments [00:09:14]. This has led to "more joined up thinking and more collective learning on the whole" [00:09:33].
    *   **Shortened Feedback Loops**: In frontline services, reduced bureaucracy and faster feedback loops with central government have been beneficial [00:09:44]. For example, a homelessness charity could provide real-time feedback to NHS England, bypassing typical bureaucratic delays [00:10:03].

*   **Leave Behind**:
    *   **Short-term Thinking**: The crisis provided an opportunity to "think bigger picture" and break away from the political cycle's tendency for short-term solutions [00:10:38]. Movements like Black Lives Matter also created space for longer-term, systems-thinking discussions [00:11:10].
    *   **Rigid Ways of Working and Siloed Thinking**: Failures in the public sector were attributed to rigid practices, the assumption that government has all the answers, and processes not conducive to systems thinking [00:11:25]. There is a need for "unlearning," letting go of historical assumptions and mental models [00:12:06].

*   **Start Doing**:
    *   **Building Relationships in Unexpected Ways**: The year saw much cross-sectoral and cross-silo interaction, providing a strong starting point [00:12:25]. Leaders need to embrace vulnerability to build trusting relationships with citizens, which is vital for advancing change [01:00:01].
    *   **Focus on Inclusive Recovery**: The [[government_responses_to_covid19 | COVID-19 pandemic]], alongside movements like Black Lives Matter, offers an opportunity to reimagine who the economy is built for and how it is structured, prioritizing an inclusive recovery [01:00:04].

### Two Scenarios for Change (Jose Mendez Mendoza's Takeaways)
Jose Mendez Mendoza identified two scenarios for the [[role_of_government_in_crisis_management | role of government after COVID-19]]:

*   **COVID-19 as a Major Force for Public Sector Collaboration**:
    *   **Increased Coordination and Collaboration**: Public servants need to engage in "engaging institutions," promoting more coordination and "silo interplay" [01:07:00]. National institutions, which struggled to cope with the crisis, should engage more with local governments, think tanks, and universities [01:07:15].
    *   **Institutional Diversity**: The crisis showed that regular solutions were insufficient. Differences within the public service (e.g., digital skills) and the impact on vulnerable groups (e.g., women, migrants) highlighted the need for diverse approaches and reflection in government action [01:08:02].
    *   **Creating Anticipatory Capacities and Policies**: Despite existing trends in government change and digitalization, the pandemic hit governments and people in unforeseeable ways [01:09:27]. This necessitates new measures and skills for evaluating activities and the speed and consequences of government decisions in real-time [01:10:10].

*   **COVID-19 as a Major Force to Transform Old Structures**:
    *   **High-Frequency, Disaggregated Data**: Governments need high-frequency, disaggregated, and fluid data to combat misinformation and respond effectively [01:10:00]. This also requires new skills within government [01:11:00].
    *   **From Service Delivery to Managers of Well-being**: Public sectors, traditionally focused on "delivery service," need to evolve into "managers of well-being." This means creating environments where people feel safe, can trust governments, and can develop properly, requiring new definitions of well-being [01:11:00].
    *   **Agile Bureaucracy**: While many services were digitized (put online), the underlying bureaucracies often remained the same, leading to public servants doing old tasks remotely [01:12:00]. True digitization requires transforming the back-end processes, not just transposing them [01:12:00].

### Overarching Themes from Government Aftershock (Heather)

*   **Working Methods of Government**: Government demonstrated capability for [[covid19_responses_and_government_adaptability | innovation, agility, adaptation]], rapid movement, remote work, and cross-silo collaboration [01:28:03]. The challenge is to sustain this and embed it into the entire system and leadership, not just as individual responsibility [01:28:26].
*   **Rapid Digital Transformation and Increased Use of Data**: Society and government digitized out of necessity [01:29:11]. This requires "human-centric regulations" that go hand-in-hand with digitization, prioritizing data privacy, transparency, and digital rights [01:29:57]. Digital tools should not replace human elements, and inclusion must be ensured [01:30:19]. It's also crucial not to simply transpose old physical processes online but to critically reflect and rethink them for the digital world [01:30:51]. Proactive thinking about future technology and steering transformation is needed [01:31:25].
*   **Collaboration**: The crisis fostered collaboration across government levels, country borders, and societal sectors (individuals, private sector, non-profits, government) [01:31:48]. The key is to sustain this collaboration beyond crisis scenarios [01:32:15]. This means leveraging local government strengths, supporting their work, and adapting structures to facilitate private and non-profit sector partnerships [01:32:23]. There's a strong consensus that national governments must work more closely together due to the cross-border nature of modern complex challenges [01:33:38].
*   **Trust and Transparency**: Trust is critical for the success of government measures [01:34:43]. It is built through human-centered communication, deliberately targeting diverse communities, and participatory processes that involve everyone in decision-making [01:35:05]. Governments' openness about uncertainty and their efforts to make the best decisions based on available knowledge increased trust during the crisis [01:36:05].
*   **Policy Priorities and Inclusion**: The crisis exposed gaps in welfare policies, leading to discussions about universal basic income [01:37:01]. Systemic issues like gender-based violence and racism also came to the forefront, emphasizing the need for policies addressing these "multifaceted and very interconnected problems" [01:37:44]. The focus must be on improving citizens' well-being, fostering social connection, community building, and creating caring societies [01:38:10].
*   **Approaching Futures and Uncertainty**: The year showed the challenging nature of complex futures [01:39:15]. Governments must proactively "probe into the future" and try different approaches to steer towards preferred outcomes [01:39:28]. This involves using less familiar methods and investing in approaches that move beyond pure risk aversion, embracing complexity [01:39:56]. Anticipation and futurist thinking, systems approaches, and agile/adaptive working methods are highly desired [[innovative_responses_to_covid19_by_governments | innovation methods]] for the future [01:40:27].

## Challenges to Preconceptions

Reflecting on the challenges to existing beliefs, Jose Mendez Mendoza noted a demystification of public servants as "superheroes" who can handle everything. He highlighted the "very little caring about what those who actually enable these policies think of them or how they actually feel" [01:54:15]. This points to the need for greater empathy and internal collaboration within government institutions [01:54:50].

Bridget added that the experience revealed the "humanity" within government, emphasizing that "there are people individuals that work within and across government too" [01:55:58]. A key challenge remains understanding the appetite of central governments to adopt these new, more agile and collaborative practices, as much of the emerging innovation has been observed at the local government and community levels [01:56:10].

## The Call to Action

A poll during the "Government Aftershock" event indicated that while governments are "willing and ready to learn from the crisis," there is less certainty about their willingness to "take action" [01:58:02]. The core question now is: What will make this crisis different from previous ones, and how can we ensure governments truly "heed the lessons and embed those into their working" [01:58:22]? The challenge is to overcome the "gravitational pull of our previous default settings" [01:59:10].

The "Government Aftershock" initiative aims to outline a "provocation for governments and for all of us," challenging everyone to consider what they will do differently [01:59:39]. This is an attempt to "hammer home the insights and the lessons" from these conversations, making them actionable and aligning them with existing or potential governmental intentions [02:01:14]. It's recognized that change requires active participation from all stakeholders, not just governments [02:00:00].

The initiative itself has served as a "collective learning prototype," demonstrating a different way of collective sense-making and learning [02:03:41]. There's an ambition to continue this work, building on lessons learned and improving guides for widespread engagements, ultimately aiming to drive action based on rich, powerful insights [02:04:04].

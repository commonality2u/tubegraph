[[Missionoriented innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is characterized by a clear purpose or a defined challenge that innovation aims to solve within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This type of innovation is purpose-driven, with specific goals guiding the innovation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Moonshot Example and Emergent Innovations

One of the most widely recognized examples of [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] is the [[moonshot_example_of_missionoriented_innovation | Moonshot]] â€” the endeavor to send humans to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This project had an unambiguous goal: either the moon was reached, or it wasn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. NASA, for instance, aligned all its systems and efforts to fulfill this singular mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

While a significant amount of innovation occurred directly as a result of the [[moonshot_example_of_missionoriented_innovation | moonshot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, numerous other types of innovations also *emerged* as side effects of this [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. These emergent innovations are new ideas that arise connected to the primary goal, and they may prove beneficial in the future, even if not the primary objective of the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The ultimate aim, however, remains the achievement of the initial clear goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

[[Understanding adaptive innovation|Adaptive innovation]] is a type of innovation characterized by exploratory activity where there is no clear direction for where the innovation is headed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It involves innovators exploring new ideas during practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Key Variables in Innovation

Two crucial variables define innovation in general, which then help differentiate various types of innovation, including [[understanding_adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>:

1.  **Direction of Activity**
    *   **Directed Activity:** Innovation aimed at solving a specific problem, such as homelessness, poverty, or climate change, with a clear mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
    *   **Non-Directed Activity:** Innovation focused on exploring and adapting to new situations, where ideas simply emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

2.  **Uncertainty or Radicality**
    *   **Radical/Uncertain:** The process is highly uncertain, often involving exploration of new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   **Incremental/Calculated Risk:** Risks associated with the innovation can be calculated, often involving exploitation of existing ideas in new contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## [[Understanding adaptive innovation|Adaptive Innovation]] in Context

[[Adaptive innovation in public services|Adaptive innovation]] arises when there is an exploration activity without a clear predefined direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Innovators engage in exploring new ideas as they practice and learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Distinctions from Other Innovation Types

Different facets of public sector innovation emerge based on these two variables of direction and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>:

*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation:** This type of innovation is connected to a directed, purpose-filled activity, aiming to solve significant societal missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   [[Anticipatory innovation|Anticipatory innovation]]: Occurs when the situation involves deep uncertainty and focuses on the exploration of new ideas and radical transformation, anticipating future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This often involves working on ideas that can be quite radical to existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   [[Enhancementoriented innovation|Enhancement-oriented innovation]]: Focuses on improving or enhancing systems that are already in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

These four key areas of public sector innovation—mission-oriented, [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive]], [[anticipatory_innovation|anticipatory]], and [[enhancementoriented_innovation|enhancement-oriented]]—each require different approaches in terms of direction, strategy, capacity, and allowance for innovation to occur within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

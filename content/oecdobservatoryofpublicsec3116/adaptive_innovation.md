[[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | Adaptive innovation]] is defined as a discovery process where the innovator lacks clear, predefined goals for why they are innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Instead, it focuses on [[exploration_and_adaptive_innovation | exploring]] new ideas and uncovering what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This approach is crucial for the emergence of entirely new concepts, especially as thinking is often confined by existing systems and paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Characteristics and Approach

[[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | Adaptive innovation]] involves exploring new ideas "on the ground" that could either enhance existing [[government_innovation_and_adaptation | government]] services or challenge the current systems in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. For this process to flourish, individuals need to be given the freedom and space, from a bottom-up perspective, to [[exploration_and_adaptive_innovation | explore]] novel ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Those working most closely with citizens are uniquely positioned to interpret signals from people's daily lives and to innovate, test, and experiment based on direct feedback from the system itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Outcomes

[[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | Adaptive innovation]] can lead to two main types of outcomes:
*   **[[transformative_and_enhancement_oriented_innovation | Transformative innovation]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **[[transformative_and_enhancement_oriented_innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

Both are considered vital outputs of the adaptive process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Example: Regulatory Understanding in Canada

An example of [[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | adaptive innovation]] comes from Canada, where individuals, often working "by the side of their desk," developed various applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The goal of these apps was to make the regulatory system more accessible and understandable for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. For instance, they created apps that simplify understanding which regulations apply when establishing a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This shift redefined the problem from one of excessive regulation to one of making existing regulation understandable and usable for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This specific initiative emerged directly from an [[adaptive_innovation_in_public_services | adaptive innovation]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

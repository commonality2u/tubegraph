The "Government Aftershock" high-level forum convened a global dialogue on modern-day challenges and the role of government, involving over 4,500 participants in 60 local conversations and 21 global forum sessions [00:00:21]. This initiative, developed by the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation in partnership with the UAE's Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation, aims to create a global call to action for government [00:00:46].

## COVID-19 as a Catalyst for Innovation

The year 2020 was atypical, as [[government_response to COVID19 | COVID-19]] significantly altered government agendas, focusing attention on combating the global pandemic [00:02:41]. This necessitated an adjustment and [[public_sector_innovation_during_COVID19 | innovation]] in how the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation approached its annual innovation trend exercise [00:02:54]. A robust knowledge base, including 683 cases from 91 countries and 450 cases from a [[public_sector_innovation_in_response_to_covid19 | COVID-19 Innovative Response Tracker]], informed discussions around five key trends in [[government_innovation_during_COVID19 | government innovation]] [00:03:15].

## Key Trends in Government Innovation

Five reports were developed based on extensive analysis and interviews with government leaders and practitioners:

*   **Innovative Responses to the COVID-19 Crisis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>: Governments rapidly took action under exceptional circumstances.
*   **Seamless Government** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>: Explores how to eliminate friction between government machinery and citizens.
*   **Focus on the Overlooked** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>: Highlights innovations addressing the needs of vulnerable societal segments.
*   **Balancing New Technologies and Rights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>: Discusses tensions governments face when using powerful new technologies while safeguarding freedoms and rights.
*   **Upskilling and Investing in the Public Service** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>: Explores how governments are investing in people and upskilling public service to unlock potential.

## Case Studies of Innovation

### The UAE Ministry of Possibilities

The Ministry of Possibilities is a virtual ministry launched in response to the UAE government's Vision 2071, which aims to make the UAE the best nation globally by 2071 [00:09:33]. It was created to incubate and solve systemic challenges and "impossibilities" that hinder progress [00:10:28].

> [!info] Mission Pillars
> The ministry's work is centered around four main mission pillars:
> 1.  Identify Impossibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>
> 2.  Incubate virtual, time-bound departments or teams to solve and explore the impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>
> 3.  Educate and train individuals on the mindset of design and experimentation in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>
> 4.  Inspire other governments with the UAE methodology of possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>

Unlike traditional ministries, it has no single active minister; instead, it relies on time-bound departments focused on "wicked questions" or national portfolios [00:10:37]. It applies design thinking and experimentation, bringing together federal and local government teams, the private sector, and citizens [00:10:48].

> [!warning] Challenges and Lessons Learned
> *   **Initiating projects with unknown solutions:** Government employees typically operate in environments of certainty, making this approach counter-intuitive [00:12:08].
> *   **Adapting to agile working methods:** Continuous iteration based on user feedback was uncomfortable for some team members, but "learning by doing" helped them acquire new skills [00:12:37].
> *   **Importance of common understanding:** A shared understanding of the "impossible" is crucial for collective progress [00:13:06].
> *   **Dedicated teams:** It requires a dedicated team with specific competencies, as it cannot be a side project [00:13:15].
> *   **Patience:** There will always be resistance to new approaches that challenge existing beliefs and norms [00:13:27].
> *   **Empowering teams:** Providing a "safe zone" and legal permission, particularly when backed by leadership, protects those who "try" and encourages experimentation [00:48:54].
> *   **Creating synergies:** Bringing stakeholders, including citizens, private sector, and government entities, on board early and making them part of decision-making creates shared ownership of the problem [00:59:42].

### Hack the Crisis (Estonia)

Estonia, known for its highly digital society and strong public-private cooperation, launched "Hack the Crisis" shortly after declaring a state of emergency on March 12 [00:15:27]. This online hackathon was conceived and launched within hours, leveraging existing collaborations and technology [00:17:35].

> [!example] Key Characteristics
> *   **Rapid Deployment:** The idea for an online hackathon was conceived on the morning of March 13th, support from the minister was secured within an hour, necessary partnerships within two hours, and technology set up within six hours [00:17:38].
> *   **Public-Private Collaboration:** The initiative involved strong cooperation with the private sector, including a startup that became Event Tornado [00:18:03].
> *   **Scale and Impact:** It attracted 1,000 participants, 30 teams, and led to actively used solutions like a government chatbot for citizen questions and physical assets like breathing ventilators [00:18:39].
> *   **Global Replication:** The Estonian event inspired nearly 70 local events worldwide, including the EU vs. Virus hack and the Global Hack, engaging around 100,000 people globally in "hacking against the virus" [00:19:59].

> [!warning] Challenges and Lessons Learned
> *   **Government Absorption Capacity:** The success led to an overwhelming number of ideas, highlighting the need for government capacity to absorb innovation [00:19:39].
> *   **Mental Health Toll:** The intense work involved in such initiatives can lead to burnout, underscoring the importance of self-care and giving people room to breathe [00:21:07].
> *   **Internal "Free Radicals":** Successfully embedding innovation requires individuals within government who are dedicated to adopting new solutions [00:21:42].
> *   **Urgency:** The shared sense of urgency during a crisis facilitates rapid public-private sector collaboration, a factor that needs to be considered for future initiatives [00:22:39].
> *   **Pre-existing Connections:** Strong prior relationships with hackathon organizers, the tech community, and innovative government positions were crucial to success [00:23:51].
> *   **Challenging "Impossible":** If someone says something is not possible within government, seek a second opinion; laws can be interpreted flexibly to enable breakthroughs [00:56:13].

### Barefoot College

Barefoot College International, based in India, works with the world's poorest and most remote communities in 93 countries [00:25:31]. Founded on Gandhian principles of "Leave No Man Behind," its programs address 14 of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals [00:25:41].

The concept of biophony, coined by Bernie Krause, offers a unique perspective on understanding [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Biophony describes humans participating in natural soundscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, exemplified by a BBC recording of the Bacca people of Central Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Bernie Krause's Work

Bernie Krause has extensively recorded the natural world for decades, from the Amazon basin to California's mountain forests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:44]</a>. Through this experience, he realized that what might initially seem like a cacophony of animal voices is, in fact, a highly orchestrated acoustic arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Characteristics of Biophony
In biophony, each creature occupies a specific acoustic niche, responding to those around them to ensure they can be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:01:02]</a>:
*   Crickets chirp at a high pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Elephants produce low, bassy sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   Certain tree frogs have an "alpha" that sets an initial pace, with other frogs singing in three- or four-time to avoid overlapping, regardless of tempo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:24]</a>.

These sounds are crucial for the animals' survival, serving purposes such as attracting mates, marking territory, and deterring threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:32]</a>. The rich, simultaneous interweaving of sounds enables animals to cooperate and respond to dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Biophony as an Ecosystem Health Indicator

Krause discovered that biophony serves as a powerful indicator of an [[innovation_ecosystems | ecosystem]]'s health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Lincoln Meadows Case Study
In 1988, Krause recorded a rich example of biophony in Lincoln Meadows, Sierra Nevada mountains, California, a forest management area slated for selective logging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:02:06]</a>. A year after logging, returning to record under the same conditions, he was astounded by the difference in sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:14]</a>. Although the habitat appeared broadly similar, the sound had completely changed; the thriving density and diversity of birds and the overall richness from the previous year were gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Application to Innovation Ecosystems

The insights from biophony are highly relevant to the concept of [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:39]</a>. Historically, innovation has often been viewed as a linear process relying on one-way technology transfer, which can be charted with clear intervention logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:03:02]</a>.

However, it's increasingly recognized that innovation thrives through the interweaving of relationships among diverse actors, each with varied interests and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Parallels with Natural Ecosystems
Similar to the Lincoln Meadows example where the habitat looked fine but the sound revealed poor health, an [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystem]] might *appear* to have all components in place, yet nothing innovative occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:23]</a>. Conversely, a cacophony of uncoordinated voices may require orchestration to foster harmony and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:32]</a>.

### The Role of Orchestration
Governments and agencies play a crucial role in orchestrating these [[innovation_ecosystems | ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:35]</a>. They need to:
*   Listen and identify what is missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   Work to bridge gaps between ideas and new products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   Help disparate stakeholders hear each other and the surrounding environment to better identify threats and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   Support stakeholders in recognizing their complementarities, drawing on each other's capabilities, adjusting activities, and developing coordinated, creative relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:04:05]</a>. This fosters a dynamic where new innovations are constantly created in response to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:13]</a>.

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) aims to use novel approaches for futures thinking to support the development of [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]], making them more future-oriented in their goals and activities, not just focused on present threats and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:27]</a>.

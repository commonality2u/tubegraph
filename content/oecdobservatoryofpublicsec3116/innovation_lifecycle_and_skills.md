Public sector innovation is an introduction to how the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) views innovation, including its definition, purpose, and the critical skill areas and lifecycle involved in its implementation, with a particular focus on problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI)

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) was established in 2016 in partnership with the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. OPSI's functions include:
*   **Uncovering What's Next**: Identifying innovative practices in both OECD and non-OECD countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Trusted Adviser**: Partnering with countries on specific issues to help them develop new ways to provide value to citizens and solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Turning Innovation into the New Normal**: Working to embed innovation into the standard way work is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

OPSI's team members are all former public sector innovators and employees, which helps keep their work grounded in practical application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Defining Innovation

There isn't a single, specific definition for innovation, as it is largely contextual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. What is innovative in one country or organization may not be in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. However, OPSI identifies three common factors:
1.  **Novelty**: Introducing new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
2.  **Implementation**: Having creative ideas is part of the [[innovation lifecycle and skills#The Innovation Lifecycle | innovation lifecycle]], but implementation is a core focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
3.  **Impact**: The implementation must have an impact, though measuring this can be challenging, especially for new and novel activities where appropriate metrics might not be immediately clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Why Public Sector Needs Innovation

A study on innovation culture, such as in Canada and Brazil, highlights several reasons for the necessity of public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>:
*   **Changing Functions**: The world is constantly changing, leading to expectations that government services also evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Closing the Service Gap**: There's often a perceived gap between services in the private sector and those in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. The public sector must rethink how it delivers value to close this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **No Room for Spectators**: Innovation should not be limited to specialized labs or specific individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Everyone in government needs to be engaged and understand how to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Citizen and Political Demand**: Citizens and politicians increasingly want more from government, and a failure to respond creates a mismatch in service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Core Competency**: Innovation needs to be embedded everywhere as a core competency, enabling better responses to future crises and reimagining government delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Three Ways to View Innovation

OPSI categorizes views on innovation into three distinct ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>:
1.  **Delivering on Today**: Focuses on "mission-driven innovation" to deliver better value based on current goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
2.  **Delivering on Tomorrow**: Involves "anticipatory innovation," looking at weak signals and future trends (e.g., AI, blockchain, automated cars) to innovate today for future realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
3.  **Ensuring Readiness**: Building capacity and capability to ensure the ability to innovate when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Key Innovation Skills

Beyond core job-specific skills, certain "skill areas" are essential for public servants to think differently and achieve new results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>:
*   **Iteration**: Doing things quickly, cheaply, and with reduced risk to get faster feedback and better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Canada's experiment mandate, allocating budget for experimentation, is an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Data Literacy**: Understanding how data provides greater insights into problems and helps measure impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **User Centricity**: Putting the end-user (citizen) at the center of government design, rather than focusing solely on internal process efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This often involves co-designing with users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Curiosity**: Asking questions and seeking new ways of doing things, like horizon scanning for cutting-edge methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Storytelling**: Crafting compelling, concise, and memorable stories that resonate with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Insurgency**: Questioning the status quo and trying new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Insurgents, though sometimes perceived as difficult, can be crucial in identifying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### Abilities, Opportunities, and Motivation (AMO) Model
Beyond just having the skills (abilities), it's crucial for the public sector to provide the **opportunity** to use these skills, as practice makes them more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Additionally, there must be **motivation** or incentive to use them; otherwise, individuals might be discouraged from pointing out issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This comprehensive model provides a more complete view of individual skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

## The Innovation Lifecycle

OPSI has developed a six-step [[innovation lifecycle and skills#The Innovation Lifecycle | innovation lifecycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>:
1.  **Identifying Problems**: Ensuring you're solving the right thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
2.  **Generating Ideas**: Collaboratively developing new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
3.  **[[developing_innovation_proposals | Developing Proposals]]**: Filtering ideas to select those to pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
4.  **Implementing**: Putting ideas into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
5.  **Evaluating**: Measuring the impact of implemented solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
6.  **Diffusing**: Identifying and spreading best practices and lessons learned (including failures) across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

It's important to note that this is not a linear process; steps may be revisited or jumped around as new information or understanding emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Problem Framing: The First Step in the Innovation Lifecycle

Problem framing is about truly understanding the underlying problem before jumping to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.

### The GE MRI Example
GE developed a world-class MRI machine for children, investing hundreds of millions in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. Despite its technological excellence, hospitals reported complaints because 80% of children needed sedation due to terror from the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

Instead of framing the problem as a design or technology failure, engineer Doug Dietz reframed it around the *experience* of using the MRI machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. They created an immersive experience where technicians tell stories (e.g., pirate ship, outer space) that incorporate the machine's noises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This simple, low-cost solution reduced sedation rates from 80% to under 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. This illustrates how reframing the problem can lead to a more effective, non-obvious solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

### The Double Diamond Design Methodology
The Double Diamond model illustrates the design process, with the first diamond focusing on framing the problem and the second on defining and finding the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.
*   **Problem Space**: Involves discovery and investigation to narrow down the actual problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.
*   **Solution Space**: Involves ideation to generate and narrow down potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

The challenge in the public sector is that many start after the first diamond, being given either a predefined problem or a solution to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. Ignoring the initial problem-finding stage often leads to disappointing results, as the focus remains on solutions rather than the root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

## Why Governments Struggle with Problem Framing

Based on OPSI's observations and conversations with innovators globally, several reasons contribute to difficulties in problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>:
*   **Push for Quick Responses**: Government often prioritizes immediate solutions over finding the right solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. This can lead to solving symptoms rather than the actual underlying problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   **Problem Intimidation**: As new information emerges, problems can become large, complex, and intimidating, making individuals feel unable to solve them or that the problem extends beyond their responsibility or autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
*   **Evolving Problems**: Problems can change or evolve, sometimes becoming entirely new issues that are not yet understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

## Approach to Problem Framing

New information should trigger a series of questions to better frame the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>:
*   What is known? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>
*   What is possible? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>
*   What is expected? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>
*   What is actually needed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>
*   What is the problem? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>

This process is cyclical, not linear, as new information and feedback are constantly received, requiring re-evaluation and potential adjustments to solutions or even complete re-innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

## Tips for Better Problem Framing

Practical advice for individuals and groups to improve problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>:
*   **Clarify Intent**: Determine what you are truly trying to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Make Assumptions Explicit**: Clearly separate facts from assumptions to challenge and verify them, ensuring the problem is framed correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
*   **Avoid Jumping to Conclusions**: Resist the urge to immediately jump to solutions after initial problem analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.
*   **Connect with Others**: Be inclusive and collaborative by bringing in diverse perspectives and experiences to broaden understanding of the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.
*   **Reframe the Problem**: Approach the problem from different perspectives to uncover new potential solutions (e.g., reframing "too hot outside" to "appropriate clothing") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.

## Common Problem Identification Tools and Strategies

A non-exhaustive list of common tools and strategies for problem identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>:
*   **Dashboards**: Provide data but often don't articulate the "why" behind issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>.
*   **Horizon Scanning**: Looking across different organizations or countries for how they might be solving similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.
*   **Design Thinking / Human-Centered Design**: A methodology focused on user-centricity to design experiences, services, and products that meet citizen needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.
*   **[[systems_thinking_in_innovation | Systems Thinking]]**: Viewing a problem through a complete lens, considering all actors and interconnections to fully understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Insights**: Understanding how people behave and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Learning**: Collaborating with peers and networks who are also solving similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   **Learning Organizations**: Continuously seeking new methods and ways of doing things within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.
*   **Innovation Labs**: Structured environments for fostering innovation, with various models and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.
*   **Experimentation**: Sending signals into the problem space to better understand the problem, not just to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

Each tool has strengths and weaknesses, and it's important to understand how they can benefit problem framing and where their limitations lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

## Practical Exercise: The Five Whys

The "Five Whys" is a simple exercise to frame a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>:
1.  Define the current problem.
2.  Continuously ask "Why?" that is happening, typically five times, to get a deeper understanding of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.

### Example: Improving Customer Satisfaction

In one case, a government agency's customer satisfaction score remained stagnant for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>. Initial internal discussions yielded anecdotal and unconfirmed reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. By connecting with end-users, two primary issues emerged: the service was too complex and too slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.

Applying the "Why?" methodology:
*   **Why are we too complex?** The process is cumbersome.
*   **Why is the process cumbersome?** No one easily understood it, and it wasn't transparent.
*   **Why wasn't it transparent?** The website was confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.

This led to simple website tweaks that directly improved customer satisfaction, a solution far different from what would have been pursued based on initial assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>. This demonstrates how the Five Whys can unpack issues to their root causes and lead to effective solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.

## Overcoming Barriers to Innovation

Governments are often conservative and risk-averse due to political, media, or cultural factors, making innovation challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. [[innovation_challenges_and_strategies | Innovation challenges and strategies]] in this environment include:
*   **Resiliency**: Innovators need to be resilient, willing to push through discouragement, and build a network of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>.
*   **Ownership**: Practitioners should focus on their direct areas of control and influence (e.g., their "50 or 100 meters") to drive incremental change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.
*   **Learning and Experimentation**: Continuously learning new ways of doing things and experimenting, even quietly, can demonstrate value and encourage adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.
*   **Leader Training**: Sending leaders to [[innovation strategies | innovation training]] and exposing them to design cycles, iteration, and prototyping can help them understand the value of these approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.
*   **Challenging Traditional Models**: The public sector often relies on lengthy, multi-year plans based on extensive analysis, which are frequently ineffective and lead to costly failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. The belief that these long plans reduce risk is often inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.
*   **Testing Quickly and Cheaply**: Similar to Silicon Valley's approach, the goal should be to study a problem, identify a few best solutions, and test them quickly and cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>. This increases the chance of success for larger investments by providing more information and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.

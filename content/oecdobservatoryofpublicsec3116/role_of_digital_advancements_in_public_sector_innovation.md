[[Innovation in general is quite difficult to define]] because it relates to new things, novelty, and concepts that did not previously exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While innovation in the private sector focuses on competitive advantage in a market context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, [[innovation in the public sector | innovation in the public sector]] faces more complexity due to the absence of a market feedback system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

[[Public sector innovation | Public sector innovation]] is defined by novelty—things new to the context, including new thinking, services, or processes—that are actually implemented and have had an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Instead of competitive advantage, which is not applicable since the government is often the sole provider, [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] aims to contribute to a change in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Digital Advancements and Public Value

[[Innovation in the public sector | Innovation in the public sector]], particularly when connected to digital advancements, can lead to new things that change public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. For example, digital advancements can enable the delivery of services to different people in a quicker fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

However, the impact of such innovation is not always uniformly positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. While digital tools can improve service delivery, they can also exclude a segment of the population that lacks access to digital tools, capabilities, or capacity to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Therefore, [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] can have both beneficial and detrimental outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, but it fundamentally involves new things implemented in a new context to bring value to the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

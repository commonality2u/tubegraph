Achieving [[Inclusive and accessible democratic participation | inclusive and accessible democratic participation]] is a key objective for governments, particularly in the digital age. This involves ensuring that all citizens, especially those from underrepresented and marginalized groups, can effectively engage with public services and contribute to policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.

## Challenges and Solutions for Inclusive Digital Participation

Governments worldwide face similar challenges in fostering broader and more equitable digital participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>. The Innovation Incubator program facilitates cross-border collaboration to address these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

### Brazil's Challenge: Broader and Equitable Digital Participation
Brazil aims to improve access and inclusiveness for underrepresented and marginalized groups, specifically focusing on low-income individuals and black people living in urban peripheries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This effort is driven by the values of democracy and participation for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.
The "Brazil Participa" platform has reached 1.4 million Brazilians but recognizes that some groups struggle with digital tools due to infrastructure access or [[Importance of digital literacy | digital literacy]] issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. Connecting digital and in-person processes is crucial to amplify participation and reinforce democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a>.

### Solutions to Brazil's Challenge

#### New York City's Civic Engagement Commission
The Civic Engagement Commission, established in 2018, works to create more participatory democratic processes in New York City, a diverse city with 8.5 million people speaking over 800 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>. Their "People's Money" participatory budgeting process addresses systemic inequality and limited access to infrastructure for low-income and diverse communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>.
Their strategies include:
*   Partnering with over 100 community-based organizations to conduct more than 500 workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>.
*   Focusing on specific ethnic groups, languages, and communities affected by the criminal justice system or disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.
*   Engaging 12,000 people and collecting 4,000 ideas for discussion in assemblies that represent the city's diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>.
*   Developing "train the trainer" methodologies for large community-based partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a>.
*   Integrating offline and online engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>, and converting inputs into policy recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a>.

#### Greater London Authority (Talk London)
The Greater London Authority's "Talk London" initiative aims to bring Londoners' voices into City Hall policy and programming to improve policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:06">[01:20:06]</a>. Promoting equitable digital participation is a daily focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:24">[01:20:24]</a>.
Their approach includes:
*   Using user-centric processes to redesign their platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.
*   Incorporating user insights from testing into continuous improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.
*   Optimizing end-to-end user journeys that begin outside the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48">[01:20:48]</a>.
*   Promoting and segmenting campaigns to diversify their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.

### Spain's Challenge: Improving Accessibility to Public Services
Andalusia's challenge is to improve accessibility to public services for people in vulnerable situations and at risk of exclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>. Their digital transformation strategy aims to ensure that no one is left behind, especially considering:
*   Andalusians at risk of social exclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:27">[01:45:27]</a>.
*   People with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:33">[01:45:33]</a>.
*   Increasing numbers of elderly people living alone, particularly women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:37">[01:45:37]</a>.
*   People in remote rural areas far from in-person services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:43">[01:45:43]</a>.
The goal is to remove access barriers to services, with an emphasis on electronic services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:49">[01:45:49]</a>, and build a comprehensive network of assistance and support through existing peripheral centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>.

### Solutions to Spain's Challenge

#### Government Lab, Chile
Chile's Government Lab, a state agency since 2015, drives the transformation of the Chilean government through a public innovation model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:12">[01:48:12]</a>. Their approach is guided by five principles:
1.  **People at the center:** Focusing on users, civil servants, and the public to improve quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:14">[01:49:14]</a>.
2.  **Multi-dimensional approach:** Multidisciplinary teams tackling problems from different perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:25">[01:49:25]</a>.
3.  **Co-creation:** Collaboration with public institutions and citizens to create public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:36">[01:49:36]</a>.
4.  **Evidence-based:** Testing solutions through prototypes and pilots before full-scale implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:45">[01:49:45]</a>.
5.  **Implementation-oriented:** Projects aiming to become public policies with positive impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:57">[01:49:57]</a>.
An example is the electronic family pocket project, which provides financial benefits for food purchases through a user-friendly digital platform to assist families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>.

#### Employment and Social Development, Canada
Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), alongside Service Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency, delivers most federal government services, administering approximately 37% of federal spending on programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>. They are committed to reducing barriers for marginalized and underserved Canadians, including:
*   Children and low-income seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

They emphasize that transformation requires sustained, consistent intervention and client-centricity in all aspects, from program design to staff upskilling for a modern [[Digital transformation and inclusion in public services | digital service model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:41">[01:54:41]</a>.

## Advisory Board Perspectives
The Advisory Board supports the Innovation Incubator, providing expertise and challenging the program with provocative questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.

### Value of the Initiative
*   **Tackling Barriers to Innovation:** The program directly addresses obstacles to innovation and collaboration in the public sector at organizational, infrastructural, and institutional levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.
*   **Scaling Impact:** It promotes lesson learning and idea sharing across borders, scaling the impact of individual products and the thinking behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. This emphasizes diversification rather than mere replication, adapting innovations to different contexts, populations, and landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.

### Creating a Safe Space for Innovation
The program creates a "safer space" for innovation and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. Acknowledging that failure is an essential part of any innovation journey, this initiative allows for learning without the high stakes of on-the-job deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. It connects problem owners with those who have firsthand experience in tackling similar challenges, fostering a supportive environment for exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>.

## Cohort-Based Learning Track
In addition to the main incubator track, a cohort-based learning track offers opportunities for 30 government teams globally to collaborate on specific innovation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. This track focuses on themes such as open experimentation, cultural transformation, [[Citizen participation in technology governance | citizen involvement]], evidence-based policymaking, and scaling public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>. Teams learn from each other, exchange resources, and share opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.

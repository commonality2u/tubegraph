Biophony, a term coined by Bernie Krause, describes the combined sounds produced by all living organisms in a given habitat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Krause, who has extensively recorded the natural world over decades, observed that what might initially seem like a "cacophony" of animal voices is, in fact, a highly orchestrated acoustic arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Characteristics of Biophony

In a biophonic environment, each creature has a distinct acoustic niche, and individual animals respond to those around them to ensure they can be heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Examples of this orchestration include:
*   Crickets chirping at a high pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Elephants making low, bassy sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Unique tree frogs singing in three-four times to avoid overlapping, regardless of the tempo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

These sounds serve essential purposes for animal survival, such as attracting mates, marking territory, and deterring threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The rich, simultaneous interweaving of sound allows animals to cooperate and respond to dangers effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Biophony as an Indicator of Ecosystem Health

Krause's work has demonstrated that biophony serves as a powerful indicator of an [[ecosystems_and_multistakeholder_collaboration | ecosystem's]] health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A notable example comes from Lincoln Meadows in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. In 1988, Krause recorded a rich example of biophony in a forest management area before selective logging occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Upon returning a year after logging under similar conditions, Krause was astonished by the difference in sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. While the habitat appeared visually similar, the soundscape was "entirely changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The thriving density and diversity of birds, and the overall richness of sound present the year before, were gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Biophony and Innovation Ecosystems

The concept of biophony offers a unique starting point for understanding and [[building_and_orchestrating_innovation_ecosystems | orchestrating innovation ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Innovation is often mistakenly understood as a linear process involving one-way technology transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. However, it is increasingly recognized that innovation is facilitated by the interweaving of relationships between diverse actors with varied interests and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

Just as a healthy natural ecosystem exhibits clear biophony, successful innovation ecosystems require careful orchestration. Sometimes, all elements for innovation may seem present, yet nothing happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. In other cases, a "cacophony of uncoordinated voices" must be orchestrated to foster harmony and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Governments and agencies involved in [[building_and_orchestrating_innovation_ecosystems | orchestrating innovation ecosystems]] need to "listen and hear what's missing" to bridge gaps between ideas and new products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The goal is to help various stakeholders perceive each other and the environment around them to better identify threats and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. By recognizing complementarities, drawing on each other's capabilities, and adjusting their activities, stakeholders can develop the coordinated, creative relationships reminiscent of the biophony observed in nature, where something new is continuously created in response to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

[[addressing climate change | Dealing with climate change]] effectively requires more ambitious and globally coordinated action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. The goal is to transition to global net-zero emissions by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

## Policy and Governance
A key pillar for collective response is access to better data on comparative policy effort and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. The OECD has proposed to G20 and OECD member countries a more coherent and globally coordinated approach to carbon pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. This approach aims to be effective by reducing global emissions rather than merely shifting them to other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, and fair by ensuring each country carries an appropriate share of the burden, recognizing diverse circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

The [[challenges_and_solutions_in_climate_policy_governance | challenge]] lies in lifting ambition and effort without causing negative distortions like competitiveness issues, carbon leakage, or trade tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. The objective is to preserve a global level playing field while increasing climate action through a comprehensive global approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. This involves assessing and reporting on explicit and implicit carbon pricing efforts worldwide to inform a more coherent way forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

Governments also need to foster public sectors that strategically embed innovation and foresight into policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a>.

## Innovation and Investment
A primary answer to the [[addressing climate change | challenge of climate change]] is [[innovation_and_technology_in_climate_mitigation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. Significant investment is needed in technologies that produce clean energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>. This means focusing on strategic answers like producing clean energy, rather than solely dealing with consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.

However, current technologies, like lithium-based batteries for electric cars, face limitations, as there isn't enough lithium on Earth to power all cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>. This necessitates inventing new materials and going "post-lithium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>. Securing enough funding for these huge investments is a political [[policy_challenges_and_strategic_approaches | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>, especially when the benefits are not immediately visible to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>.

## Global Cooperation and Trust
[[addressing climate change | Climate change]] must be addressed at a global level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. The European Union is trying to lead by setting ambitious goals to make its continent CO2 neutral by 2050, incurring economic costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:03">[01:07:03]</a>. If the EU's leadership in this struggle falters, there may not be enough global energy and power to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>.

A significant [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenge]] is the varying levels of public trust in science across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. This lack of trust becomes problematic when making decisions on [[addressing climate change | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

## Lessons from the Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic, a sharp and urgent crisis, offers lessons for the longer, less immediate crisis of climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. While the pandemic required quick reactions and adaptable leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>, [[addressing climate change | climate change]] demands more long-term planning, strategic foresight, and considering the development of technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>. Both types of crises require a mindset of change management and the ability to bring diverse resources together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.

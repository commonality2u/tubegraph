The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted dramatic transformations within the public sector, raising questions about whether these changes will induce sustainable, resourced, and long-standing innovations in governance that will endure in the decades to come, or if governments will revert to "business as usual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This discussion explores how the public sector can sustain these transformations beyond the immediate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The "Government Aftershock" Initiative

The "Government Aftershock" initiative by the OECD is an experiment in collective learning, aiming to make sense of the crisis and understand its implications for the institution of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This initiative focuses on three central questions regarding governance and state management after the pandemic:
*   What should be left behind? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   What should be kept? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   What should be done differently? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

The OECD's Innovative Responses Tracker has captured over 430 innovative responses to the pandemic across various policy areas, functions, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. These include shifts to widespread remote working, telehealth, desiloing the state, encouraging cross-policy collaboration, greater stakeholder engagement, raising risk tolerance, and reducing administrative burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The goal is to sustain the waves of [[Public Sector Innovation in Response to COVID19 | innovation and transformation]] unlocked by the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Unlocking Innovation: Why a Crisis Was Needed

Despite the long-standing recognition of beneficial practices like teleworking, telehealth, agile methods, and user-centric design, their widespread adoption often required a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Historical barriers to [[Government innovation during COVID19 | government innovation]] include:
*   **Bandwidth Constraints** Public service organizations often face too many demands, making it difficult to focus on consistent programs of change and reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   **Vested Interests** Reform challenges existing ways of doing things, affecting economic interests and making life difficult for certain groups, who may resist necessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion** The "gotcha culture" in the public sphere, where mistakes are scrutinized through parliamentary committees or inquiries, leads to extreme risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.
*   **Lack of Entrepreneurial Mindset** Pre-crisis, "habits" rather than "laws" often dictated what could or couldn't be done, stifling an entrepreneurial approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. The crisis provided a "burning platform to change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, enabling clear directions, autonomy for front-line decisions, and fostering a team-sport mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
*   **Attention Span** It's hard to sustain interest and funding for contingency planning over long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

The pandemic released funding and broke down scaling barriers, allowing pilot programs and innovations that had been developing in small instances to rapidly go to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

## Enduring Transformations: What's Here to Stay

Many changes are expected to persist beyond the immediate crisis:
*   **Work from Anywhere (Remote/Blended Working)** The concept of the workplace as a physical building has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. A blended approach, with some days in the office and some at home, is likely to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. This shift is also driving changes in how classified information is handled and how employee performance is evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   **Digitalization and Data-Driven Decision-Making** The shift to digital forms and services is accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. Decisions are increasingly based on data, aiding in designing measures and understanding complex situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. The application of artificial intelligence, such as chatbots, is also picking up speed to improve service delivery and augment the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
*   **Speed of Reaction and Agility** Governments have reorganized themselves to be more agile, forming dynamic task forces instead of traditional slow ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. Incremental innovation, step-by-step experimentation, and faster decision-making are likely to remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Consultation and Collaboration** The crisis has fostered greater [[Public sector innovation and collaboration | collaboration and innovation in the public sector]] within governments, between governments and society, and among nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. This involves a deformalization of processes and more bottom-up solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.
*   **Increased Capacity in Health Systems** Many countries have seen increased capacity in their health systems, and the infrastructure for test and tracing systems, as well as future immunization programs, is expected to endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.
*   **Systematic Appreciation of Social and Racial Justice** The pandemic has illuminated and forced a recognition of the impact of social and racial justice issues within government programs, leading to efforts to adjust structures for more equitable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.

## Challenges to Sustaining Innovation

Several warning signs indicate potential challenges to sustaining these changes:
*   **Public Trust** The ability of governments to sustain changes is closely tied to public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The perception of government performance during the crisis will impact future trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Political and Financial Support** Sustaining momentum for [[Government responses to COVID19 and innovation | government responses to COVID19 and innovation]] requires political leadership and strong administrative leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. The financial implications of increased national debt and reduced tax bases may lead to austerity measures, making it difficult to fund continued innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.
*   **Human Capital and Digital Literacy** While the crisis has given public servants a sense of purpose and may attract more talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>, digital literacy and accessibility challenges within society remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.
*   **Federalism and Aid Distribution** In complex federal systems, the efficient and equitable distribution of aid funds can be challenging, leading to differing perceptions of support and impacting public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.
*   **Politicization of Response** The politicization of crisis responses can undermine public trust and the government's ability to act effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.
*   **Data Utilization** A critical capacity issue is how governments use, link, and extract value from data to make better decisions and provide better services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning** There is a continuous need for learning and adaptation, not just when new people join the public sector, but for all administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

## Habits to Decommission

For future resilience and innovation, several administrative habits should be abandoned:
*   **Inability to "End Things" / Deprioritization** Governments are often good at starting initiatives but poor at ending them or deprioritizing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>.
*   **Excessive Risk Aversion** Moving away from a "gotcha culture" towards a learning culture is crucial to encourage sensible risk-taking and entrepreneurial behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
*   **Slow Policy-Making Cycles** Long cycles of policy making and adoption need to be replaced with smart, incremental policies that speed up the legislative and policy creation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
*   **Siloed Work** The tendency to work in silos must be overcome to foster greater [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaboration and innovation in the public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>.
*   **Static Career Model** The idea of public service as a rigid, lifetime career within a single organization needs to be rethought. A more permeable service model allowing movement between government and the private sector could bring in new ideas and foster [[Innovation in cities postCOVID19 | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.

## Commitments for the Future

Panelists expressed personal commitments to foster ongoing change:
*   **Addressing Social and Racial Equity** Work with public administrators to address social and racial equity issues in policy programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>.
*   **Environmental Responsibility** Lower personal and organizational carbon footprints and increase carbon handprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.
*   **Nurturing Future Leaders** Invest more time in nurturing the next generation of leaders within public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>.
*   **Instilling Innovation Culture** Focus on influencing the mindset of government employees to instill a culture of [[Leadership and Innovation during COVID19 | innovation]], ensuring flexibility to cope with an uncertain future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The conversation highlights that while the crisis acted as a catalyst for significant [[public sector innovation during COVID19 | public sector innovation during COVID19]], sustaining these gains will require continued political commitment, fiscal prudence, a shift in organizational culture towards greater risk tolerance and agility, and continued investment in human capital and data infrastructure. The long-term impact on [[Innovation and inclusion in government recovery efforts | government recovery efforts]] and public trust remains to be seen.

Governments are constantly considering the future, but they don't always leverage all available knowledge to prepare for and shape it. This creates an "impact gap" where strategic foresight and anticipatory work often fail to translate into policy actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## The Role of Experimentation

Anticipatory innovation aims to help public sector organizations detect, understand, and act upon future changes in their present-day work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. While terms like "future-proof" or "future-fit" can lose meaning, they gain relevance when organizations actively work in the present to prepare for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

The future is crucial for the legitimacy of policy decisions in a democracy, for addressing challenges like climate change and biodiversity loss, and for making digital transformation inclusive and beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. [[Innovation Strategies for Governments | Strategic foresight]] contributes significantly to strengthening democracy, promoting public trust, and preparing governments to serve societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Since it's impossible to know the future or have all the right answers in advance, considering multiple alternative futures helps in making more prepared decisions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

> "The learning and evidence gathering that experimentation allows are at the heart of what is [[Innovation in the public sector | public sector innovation]] today and they're also at the heart of effective democratic and sustainable public policy that's what we mean when we talk about anticipatory innovation governance." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> â€“ Marco Daglio, Head of the OECD [[Role of innovation labs in government | Observatory of Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI).

Experimentation plays a huge role because [[Innovation for exploration and creativity in government | futures]] work is about taking in uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. It helps organizations avoid being completely paralyzed by uncertainty, disruptions, and the possibility of being wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

## Overcoming Organizational Habits and the "Myth of Best Practice"

A significant challenge in integrating [[Innovation in the public sector | futures practice]] within a public policy context is dealing with organizational habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. These habits, particularly in large bureaucratic institutions like governments, can stand in the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. These barriers include:
*   Existing policies and precedents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>
*   Established rules and routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>
*   Resistance to change ("that's how we've always done it") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>
*   Organizational culture that may foster [[Managing risk and experimentation in government | risk aversion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>
*   Lack of internal capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>

Unless these organizational habits are investigated, thinking about the future and [[Innovation in the public sector | innovation]] becomes challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. A key question for futures work is "what if we were wrong?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a> This is a difficult question for large bureaucratic organizations to entertain, but events like COVID-19 have demonstrated that disruptions can occur, leading to significant, impactful errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The focus is now on preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

Thinking with a longer horizon, such as a decade or a generation, can change the policy options available to solve bigger problems, like issues within the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

A "myth of best practice" often exists, where past methods are assumed to work again in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. When looking at the future, this is a myth, as often "nobody knows" the definitive best approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. The challenge then becomes designing experiments to facilitate [[Learning and capacity building in government | collaborative learning]] between the public sector, academia, and the private sector through a deliberative learning process of testing, observing, reflecting, and re-testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

## Challenges and Daily Experimentation

In public sector organizations like the European Commission, specific challenges arise:
*   **Strong pressure for short-term policy and political outcomes:** This often leads to a focus on the immediate "now" rather than long-term strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Culture of efficiency and quantitative focus:** This can create barriers for foresight teams that use participatory and qualitative approaches, considering factors like people's values and changing behaviors that don't easily fit into quantitative models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   **Lack of foresight literacy:** There is a significant need to train colleagues on what foresight is and how best to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. However, there is growing interest, especially since COVID-19 demonstrated that unexpected events can happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

Foresight aims to help people become more comfortable with uncertainty, emphasizing that uncertainty simply means "you don't know" and can lead to positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. It helps steer towards positive futures and avoid negative ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

Despite the existence of standard foresight methods and processes, [[Government experimentation and case studies | experimentation]] is a daily reality due to the diversity of policy contexts and specific requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. Projects often require combining and tweaking standard methods to adapt to specific circumstances and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. An aspirational goal is to organize a participatory foresight session with high-level decision-makers, such as the College of the European Commission, to "contaminate their thinking with foresight seeds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

Effective evaluation is crucial for the success and accountability of [[impact_of_mission_oriented_innovation_on_society | mission-oriented innovation]] and public investments. Traditional evaluation methods are often insufficient for assessing the complex and dynamic nature of mission-driven approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## The Need for New Evaluation Frameworks

Current approaches to evaluating public investments typically rely on static methods like cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and net present value (NPV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. However, these are inadequate for capturing the full scope and dynamic spillovers of mission-oriented projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

Instead, a more rigorous framework is needed to:
*   Measure success in the context of "market shaping" or "co-creation" rather than just "market fixing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.
*   Welcome uncertainty and allow for risk-taking, recognizing that failures provide learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.
*   Capture "dynamic spillovers" â€“ unintended innovations and benefits that occur throughout the mission's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
*   Support a "portfolio approach" where public sector investments are viewed as a series of experiments, similar to venture capital, but with a focus on public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.
*   Ensure that successes have broad impact and that the benefits (rewards) are shared, not just the risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>.

## Current State and [[challenges_in_implementing_missionoriented_projects | Challenges in Implementing Mission-Oriented Projects]]

Despite the recognized need for new approaches, many [[integrating_missionoriented_approaches_in_government_and_policymaking | mission-oriented policies]] still rely on traditional evaluation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. There is often limited reflection on pilot experiments, which hinders the scaling up of mission orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>.

Common challenges include:
*   **Lack of Clear Targets and Timelines** Some "mission areas" lack specific deadlines or concrete targets, making evaluation difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>.
*   **"Mission Washing"** Initiatives may be branded as mission-oriented without truly adhering to the core principles, resembling traditional industry targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>.
*   **Linear vs. Iterative Design** Mission creation is often presented as a one-off stage, rather than a long, sequential process where targets and solutions evolve through bottom-up steering and project-level learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy and Administrative Instruments** Existing administrative structures, procurement processes, and incentive systems in government can hinder cross-departmental collaboration and risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>.
*   **Fear of Failure** Public agents, especially decision-makers, are often punished for taking risks rather than incentivized for experimentation and learning from failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

## Strategies for Effective Evaluation

To address these challenges, several strategies are proposed:

### 1. New Metrics and Narratives
*   **Dynamic Metrics**: Develop metrics that capture the dynamic spillovers and broader impact of missions, moving beyond traditional cost-benefit analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.
*   **Learning Organizations**: Frame public organizations as "learning organizations" that can learn from failures, requiring in-house capabilities and investments in trial-and-error processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>.
*   **Public Value Narrative**: Shift the narrative to acknowledge public organizations as "value-creating" entities, rather than just market-fixers, which inherently involves risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.
*   **Symbiotic Partnerships**: Develop metrics to assess the nature of public-private partnerships, distinguishing between symbiotic, mutualistic, or parasitic relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

### 2. Strategic Implementation
*   **Mission Positioning**: Place missions at the center of economic growth strategies, involving finance ministries and core cabinet discussions, rather than siloed within innovation or environment ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.
*   **Conditionalities**: Embed goals and conditionalities into public loans and contracts (e.g., requiring companies to lower carbon emissions or reinvest profits) to ensure that public investment steers the economy toward desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem-Based Approaches**: Work with [[collaborative_frameworks_in_health_missions | local entrepreneurship ecosystem networks]] and focus on "place-based innovation" to unlock systemic change, rather than purely sectoral approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>.
*   **Bottom-Up Experimentation**: Design tools that foster multiple bottom-up solutions, recognizing that real missions often emerge from a long and sequential process of learning from projects on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>.
*   **Prototyping**: Utilize prototypes as a way to gather evidence, build political capital, and design solutions that can scale rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>.

### 3. People-Centric Approach
*   **Inclusivity**: Actively engage diverse communities and "underrepresented voices," including citizens, workers, and local stakeholders, in the co-creation and implementation of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:18">[01:52:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:29">[02:03:29]</a>.
*   **Relationship Building**: Focus on fostering trusted personal relationships, mutual understanding, and shared vision among different actors (public, private, third sector, academia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:45">[02:05:45]</a>.
*   **Learning from the Field**: Go to where the "sense of urgency" is felt most strongly and where successful local initiatives are already happening, inviting other stakeholders to observe and learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:19">[02:14:19]</a>.

### Tools and Methodologies

*   **System-in-the-Room Workshops**: Convene diverse stakeholders from the front line to collectively build system maps and understand complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:20">[01:58:20]</a>.
*   **Mission Design Canvas**: A tool that allows organizations to sketch out a mission, navigate uncertainty, and learn and adapt along the way, without needing all the answers at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>.
*   **Wooclap**: An online polling tool used for real-time sensing of challenges and feedback from large audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.
*   **Mural Board**: A digital whiteboard used for collaborative brainstorming and thematic analysis in breakout rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:48">[02:17:48]</a>.
*   **Field Labs**: Instruments used in the Netherlands to implement missions by starting with initiatives that meet local needs and then scaling them up into the broader system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:52">[01:44:52]</a>.
*   **Moin Online Toolkit**: A platform developed by the OECD for accessing resources and analysis on mission-oriented policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>.

Overall, evaluating mission impact requires a shift from traditional, rigid evaluation frameworks to more dynamic, systemic, and people-centered approaches that embrace complexity, foster collaboration, and learn from both successes and [[evaluating_mission_success_and_handling_failure | failures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.

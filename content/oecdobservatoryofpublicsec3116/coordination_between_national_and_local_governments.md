The Forum on Government After Shock hosted a session focused on rethinking and rebuilding through innovation, examining government responses to the COVID-19 crisis. The discussion aimed to reflect on effective strategies, challenges, and missing elements in governance, particularly concerning the future of government beyond the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A key area of focus was how national and federal governments effectively managed the global problem at both national and subnational levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Roles of National and Federal Governments
An audience poll asked about the most effective roles played by national and federal governments in response to the crisis, with four options:
*   Deploying a unified response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   Enabling other actors, including the subnational level, to play a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Countering negative economic impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Providing direct support to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

The poll results showed that "countering negative economic impact" and "providing direct support to citizens" received 30% of the votes each, while "deploying a unified response" and "enabling other actors, including the local level" each received 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Minister Nikolaj Astrup of Norway acknowledged this as a natural response, highlighting the immediate impact of the crisis on people's jobs and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. He emphasized that for effective economic and citizen support, a holistic approach involving coordination, unified response, trust, and transparency across public and private sectors is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

## Norway's Approach to Crisis Management
Norway, a society with inherently high trust, found this foundational trust important for its response measures and the public's willingness to adhere to government advice and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Building Trust and Communication
Key elements in building and maintaining trust included:
*   **Communication** Central government held frequent press conferences when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Targeted Outreach** Press conferences were specifically directed at children, with the Prime Minister and other ministers answering questions from kids digitally, to ensure every part of the population understood the measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Public question times were also held on platforms like Facebook, allowing direct interaction with ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Transparency** Openness about why measures were implemented, including aspects where certainty was low but actions were still necessary, was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Efforts were made to reach immigrant communities who might not follow mainstream Norwegian news by engaging with religious leaders to convey guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Scientific Basis** Government decisions were closely coordinated with health authorities and based on scientific advice. When this advice was disregarded due to other considerations (e.g., economic implications), the government was transparent about it to maintain trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### National and Subnational Coordination
Coordination was vital in Norway's national response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   Regular meetings were held with County Governors and municipalities across the diverse country to ensure effective [[multilevel_governance_and_collaboration_in_urban_policymaking | multilevel governance and collaboration in urban policymaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   These meetings involved multiple national ministers to ensure coordination across sectors affected by the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. An example given was safeguarding vulnerable children during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Local Adaptation and Autonomy
While national guidelines and requirements were provided, it was important for local governments (municipalities) to have the authority and means to adapt COVID-19 measures to local situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This flexibility is crucial because local circumstances, such as outbreaks, vary significantly across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Overly harsh or insufficient local restrictions can erode public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Addressing Diverse Needs and Vulnerable Groups
The pandemic's global reach had targeted local effects, impacting various groups including vulnerable communities, youth, and immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Norway provided financial and advisory support to municipalities to target vulnerable groups effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. A clear directive was given that healthcare workers focusing on vulnerable children should not be diverted to COVID-19 tracing, ensuring these essential services continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Future Outlook
The crisis highlighted several areas for improvement and opportunities for long-term transformation in [[intergovernmental_cooperation_and_policy_integration | intergovernmental cooperation and policy integration]] and innovation.

### Breaking Down Silos
The COVID-19 crisis accelerated the long-discussed need to break down governmental silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Coordination of government efforts must be much closer than traditionally practiced, as societal challenges rarely fit neatly into single departmental responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Fostering Innovation
The crisis thrust innovation upon governments, demonstrating that different ways of working are possible under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. This "Spirit of Innovation" needs to be safeguarded post-crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Digitalization of Services** Online health consultations, previously underutilized, saw an explosion in use during the pandemic, proving their efficiency for both citizens and health services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   **Adapting Legal Frameworks** The crisis revealed legal barriers to digitalization, such as requirements for physical meetings or signatures. This pushed efforts to make laws technology-neutral and "AI-ready" more swiftly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

### The Importance of Culture, [[leadership_and_teamwork_in_public_administration | Leadership and Teamwork in Public Administration]], and Competence
Societal change relies on three core elements:
1.  **Culture** A culture that encourages thinking outside the box, challenging existing methods, allowing new ideas, and accepting a degree of failure (within reason for taxpayer money) to foster innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
2.  **Leadership** Leaders who inspire this culture of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
3.  **Competence** The necessary skills to follow through on innovations. This requires close [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | collaboration between governments and citizens]] between municipal and national levels, especially for smaller municipalities lacking resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

### Seamless Services Across Levels
A key goal for government innovation and digitalization is to provide seamless services across governmental levels, as citizens care about receiving quality service efficiently, not which level of government provides it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. Strategies for public sector innovation and digitalization are developed collaboratively with the municipal level to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

### Maintaining Focus on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
Despite the crisis, Norway emphasized integrating SDGs into all governmental efforts, both national and subnational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. COVID-19 measures themselves must be viewed through the lens of SDGs, focusing on addressing inequalities, ensuring good education and health services even for vulnerable children, and supporting sustainable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

## Maintaining Public Trust
Norway's success in maintaining high trust in government institutions, even while trust in individual politicians may fluctuate, is attributed to:
*   **Openness** Being a very open society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **Accessibility** Politicians are highly accessible and actively engage with the public, bridging the gap between leaders and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
*   **Proximity** Leaders do not operate from an "ivory tower" but actively seek to connect with the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

## Conclusion: A Holistic Approach
The COVID-19 crisis, though challenging, has accelerated existing trends like digital transformation and highlighted the absolute necessity of [[multilevel_governance_and_collaboration_in_urban_policymaking | multilevel governance and collaboration in urban policymaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. The Minister of Local Development and Modernization of Norway emphasized that solving complex challenges like climate change, growing inequalities, and future crises requires collective effort, open communication, and trust building across all levels of government and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>. The crisis has reinforced the idea that "we are all in the same boat," a sentiment crucial for tackling future global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

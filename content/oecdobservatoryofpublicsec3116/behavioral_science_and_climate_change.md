Human behavior is recognized as a crucial element in addressing climate change challenges, a fact acknowledged as early as the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which highlighted the importance of sustainable lifestyles and consumption/production patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. By 2021, it became clear that human behavior would be integral to almost any [[Behavioral science in public governance | public governance]] measure related to climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Consequently, sustainability has been a top policy area for [[application_of_behavioral_science | behavioral scientists]] over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Past Applications and Limitations

Successful examples of [[application_of_behavioral_science | behavioral science]] in environmental policy include feedback interventions to reduce energy consumption and better labeling of products to encourage sustainable spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

However, a key limitation has been that [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] has primarily been used to improve policies *already implemented*, rather than informing *early policy development* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. To effectively address climate change, it is vital to integrate [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] earlier in the policy process, even during the design of environmental policies, discussions of new taxes and regulations, and stakeholder consultations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Future Directions and Opportunities

Moving forward, the focus needs to shift from systemic behavioral solutions to systemic change, empowering [[Behavioral science in public governance | public governance]] systems to lead with new choice architectures where information, regulation, and financial incentives facilitate green habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Key Areas for Impact

1.  **System Diagnostic**: [[Role of behavioral science in government | Behavioral science]] can serve as a diagnostic tool, not just to understand who changes behavior, but crucially, to understand *why people don't change* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This provides clues about systemic drivers or structures that prevent desired behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
2.  **Garnering Policy Support**: [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] can be used to "soften the audience" or encourage support for policies *ahead of their implementation* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Research suggests that people already performing pro-environmental behaviors are more likely to support related policies, even controlling for attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. This indicates that behavior can be a pathway to greater policy support through mechanisms like spillover effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
3.  **Providing New Tools**: [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] offers new tools for green policy proposals, particularly in designing demand generation programs for new technologies like heat pumps and electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
4.  **Improving Information Comprehension**: Controlled experiments can pre-test interventions aimed at improving the comprehension and processing of information. For example, testing different ways to present time-of-use tariffs for smart meters showed that simple tables outperformed intuitive clock visuals in terms of comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.
5.  **Multi-pronged Interventions**: Simple "quick win" nudges may not be sufficient for complex issues. For example, letters encouraging heat pump inquiries increased calls but not actual installations, highlighting that removing one barrier (awareness) is not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. Instead, multi-pronged interventions that tackle multiple barriers simultaneously are needed, inspired by successful programs like the "Solarize" campaigns in the US which combine community events, financial incentives, and contractor coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.
6.  **Broader Policy Domains**: Beyond energy, [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science]] is relevant across various environmental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. Current topical areas include:
    *   **Water Conservation**: Especially during droughts, public mood for change creates an appetite for action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.
    *   **Biodiversity**: Major reports and international targets (e.g., replacing Aichi targets) create policy windows for behavioral interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.
    *   **Waste Management and Food Waste Reduction**: This includes compliance with recycling regulations and reducing household or industrial food waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

### Challenges and Considerations

*   **Scaling Interventions**: A persistent challenge is scaling up successful academic interventions to a broader population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Ineffective Interventions**:
    *   Over-reliance on natural financial incentives for energy saving, as people are not always rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. Significant incentives (e.g., doubling or tripling time of use) are often required to see an effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
    *   Providing raw data (e.g., digital energy meters) without guidance; very few people access or engage with their energy data, leading to little behavior change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   **Carbon Taxes and Financial Disincentives**: These are often politicized, and their acceptance can be influenced by the macro context and public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. Behavioral insights can help design smarter carbon taxes, for example, by providing a "climate bonus" at the beginning of the year and framing it clearly to link it to climate goals and prevent energy poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Models for Organizations**: Individual models of behavior can effectively explain and predict the behavior of organizations (e.g., why they act based on perceived benefits, social pressure, and capabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. Organizations also respond to normative influences and pressure from rivals and customers demanding greener products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Over-reliance on "Soft" Approaches**: [[Behavioral public policy | Behavioral public policy]] should complement, not replace, "harder" regulation like financial incentives, disincentives, and bans on toxic materials or food waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. Governments should avoid taking the "easy way out" by only using [[behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | behavioral insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.
*   **Reducing "Sludge"**: Behavioral science can help reduce administrative burdens ("sludge") and hassle factors in policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. For example, the UK government's scheme to pay households to switch to greener heating systems faces challenges due to a lack of skilled plumbers and immense waiting times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.
*   **Equitable Services and Segmentation**: While customer segmentation can target groups more likely to adopt green behaviors, ethical considerations arise when conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs where some receive benefits and others don't) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. The goal should be to make some people better off, not worse off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.

## Call to Action for Policymakers

To maximize the impact of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] in green governance, policymakers should:

*   **Embed [[behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | Behavioral Insights]]**: Make the use of [[behavioral_insights_in_public_policy | behavioral insights]] an embedded, standard step in the policy design process, akin to conducting a cost-benefit analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:45">[01:05:45]</a>. This requires moving beyond ad-hoc projects driven by individual interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Implement Green Defaults**: Introduce green defaults in all policies, from procurement to schools, to make the sustainable choice the easiest and most common option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>. People learn from doing, and defaults provide a quicker path to behavior change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.
*   **Be Transparent**: Be transparent about policy goals and mechanisms, as people do not like to feel tricked or manipulated, especially concerning financial policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>.
*   **Complement Traditional Tools**: Ensure that [[behavioral_public_policy | behavioral public policy]] approaches complement, rather than limit, more effective "harder" policies like regulation, bans, and significant financial mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>.
*   **Reduce Friction**: Conduct "sludge assessments" to identify and eliminate unnecessary barriers and bureaucratic complexities in policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>.
*   **Foster [[Collaborations in behavioral science | Collaboration]]**: Integrate knowledge from other disciplines like human-centered design and architecture, which are adept at understanding how people interact with spaces and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.
*   **Utilize Citizen Juries and Panels**: Engage citizens in co-designing policies, especially for complex questions, through mechanisms like citizen juries and panels, which can build support for reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.
*   **Strategic Prioritization**: Prioritize specific behaviors that have the greatest potential impact and are relatively easy to change, then align all policy levers around promoting those behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>. An example is the city of Townsville's program to encourage residents to paint their roofs white, resulting in significant energy savings through a coordinated, multi-stakeholder effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>.

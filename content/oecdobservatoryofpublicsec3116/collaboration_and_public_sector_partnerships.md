The "Government Aftershock" initiative, a collective learning exercise, involved extensive [[Public sector innovation and collaboration | collaboration]] among various stakeholders globally. This included a co-design process with over 60 stakeholders worldwide, leading to a global enterprise of more than 65 events with over 5,500 participants, including ministers and heads of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The aim was to tap into and share learning, connecting different groups to identify insights and lessons that could be translated across contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. The OECD facilitated this by convening and aggregating these diverse insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Core Beliefs for Reimagined Government

The Center for Public Impact (CPI), a not-for-profit foundation, highlighted an emerging vision for a reimagined government that [[collaborative_approaches_in_public_sector_innovation | embraces complexity]], relationship building, and experimentation for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This vision is founded on three core beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>:
1.  Societal challenges are complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
2.  The quality of human relationships is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
3.  Progress is best achieved through experimentation and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

These beliefs give rise to principles for government leaders, including thinking systematically but acting locally, sharing power with those best placed to act, challenging unnecessary hierarchy, and [[Intergovernmental and crosssectoral collaboration | collaborating across boundaries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Key Insights on Collaboration

Throughout the "Government Aftershock" discussions, several key themes emerged regarding [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaboration]]:

### Cross-Sectoral and Cross-Silo Engagement
There has been significant outreach and [[Crossborder collaboration in public sector innovation | cross-sectoral collaboration]], leading to a breakdown of silos both within and across governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This has created a vital space for reflection and discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Participants noted a "much more joined up thinking and more collective learning on the whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### Strengthened Relationships and Feedback Loops
The pandemic has accelerated relationship building, particularly between central and local governments, as well as between government and citizens. Shortened feedback loops with central government have become a positive outcome for frontline services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. For example, a homelessness charity was able to provide real-time feedback on community needs to NHS England, leading to bureaucracy disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This emphasizes the need to build trusting relationships, where government leaders can also be vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Importance of Institutional Diversity and Local Engagement
COVID-19 highlighted the need for diverse institutional responses, as "regular solutions" were often insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. National institutions struggled to cope, emphasizing the need to engage more with local governments, think tanks, research centers, and universities to prepare for future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. Local levels showed many good examples of managing the pandemic, which national governments could scale up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

### Broadened [[Collaborative approaches in public sector innovation | Collaboration]] Across Sectors
The crisis demonstrated government's capability for innovation, agility, and [[Public sector innovation | adaptation]], including working remotely and [[intergovernmental_and_crosssectoral_collaboration | collaborating across silos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. This [[Collaboration between governments and civil society organizations | collaboration]] occurred across levels of government, country borders, and sectors of society (individuals, private sector, non-profit, government) due to common problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. The challenge is to sustain this collaboration beyond crisis scenarios, building on the strengths of local governments and utilizing mechanisms like hackathons and challenge-based procurement with private and non-profit sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>.

### International Cooperation
The pandemic underscored that complex challenges transcend national borders, making [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_sector_innovation | international collaboration]] more crucial than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. There is a need to improve [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaboration approaches]] and consider the role of international organizations in collective problem-solving, not only for crises but also for ongoing interconnectivity in areas like trade and digitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

### Focus on Human-Centered Processes
As digitization advances, it's vital that human-centric regulations accompany these approaches, with data privacy, transparency, and digital rights at the core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. Technology should be a tool to enhance human elements, not replace them, ensuring inclusivity and protecting people's rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. This also implies not just transposing physical processes online, but critically reflecting on and redesigning services for the digital world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for the Future

While there was a consensus on the need for continued [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaboration]] and learning, participants noted concerns about governments' willingness to take action post-crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. The key question is how to ensure that the positive changes and collaborative efforts seen during the pandemic are sustained and not pulled back by previous default settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>. This requires connecting, empowering, and legitimizing efforts within and outside government to demand better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.

There is a clear appetite for new approaches, particularly anticipation and futurist thinking, systems approaches, and agile/adaptive working methods, to prepare for future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. The "Government Aftershock" initiative itself serves as a prototype for collective learning and sense-making, aiming to foster ongoing widespread engagement and generate actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.

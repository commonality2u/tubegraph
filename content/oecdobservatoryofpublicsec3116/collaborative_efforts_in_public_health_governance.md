The COVID-19 crisis has brought to light both the vulnerabilities of existing health systems and the critical importance of [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaborative approaches]] to public health governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This global challenge has served as an experiment for the OECD, facilitating a series of international events to gather mutual learnings from localities worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Readiness for Change and the Role of Collaboration

Across various countries, the pandemic revealed differing levels of preparedness and the necessity for rapid adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Latvia's "Miracle" of Cooperation
Despite having one of the worst-funded health systems in the EU, Latvia managed a "miracle" by regrouping and reorganizing, utilizing its best resources, particularly health workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. A key success story was the very good [[stakeholder_collaboration_in_healthcare | cooperation with private service providers]], which dramatically increased testing capacities in a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This highlights that people are often more innovative than institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Ireland's Staff Willingness
Ireland's health system was not entirely ready, facing shortages of critical care beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. However, there was a crucial willingness from all staff, especially nursing staff, to undertake training and support intensive surge capacity preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Furthermore, community support and volunteerism, including local authorities and sporting organizations, significantly contributed to the response, demonstrating a valuable public buy-in and goodwill that can be leveraged for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

### Korea's Integrated Approach
Korea's success stemmed from three factors: enhanced diagnostic capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, effective use of existing data infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, and a well-structured governance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. All relevant organizations, including local governments, were linked under the umbrella of the central disaster management headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This [[intergovernmental_and_crosssectoral_collaboration | intergovernmental and cross-sectoral collaboration]] was made possible by pre-existing infrastructure, such as a single unified national health insurance system and advanced information infrastructure, which were not specifically developed for COVID-19 management but proved invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The painful experience of the MERS crisis in 2015 also led to the development of a robust crisis management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

### Sweden's Bridging of Gaps
Sweden, often in the spotlight for its unique approach, managed to double ICU capacity and ensure continuous availability from the pandemic's start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. A significant achievement was creating a tight [[stakeholder_collaboration_in_healthcare | collaboration]] within its previously fragmented health system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. The crisis highlighted the importance of bridging gaps between national, regional, and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. This newfound [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaboration]] was driven by having a singular, shared goal for the health system – combating the pandemic – which facilitated easier coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

## Learning from the Double Burden

The pandemic introduced a "double burden" on health systems: managing COVID-19 cases while maintaining essential non-emergency services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

*   **Latvia:** Initially closed most planned services, leading to heavy impacts on accessibility, but later reorganized to keep healthcare open as long as possible, focusing on maintaining services while adapting to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. They also sought to develop more home healthcare solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **Sweden:** Explicitly aimed to maintain a broad health perspective, which influenced decisions like keeping schools open due to concerns about negative health impacts of closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. While affected in the first wave, Sweden's health system bounced back quickly in the second wave, largely maintaining elective surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
*   **Israel:** Handled the second wave differently from the first, ensuring hospitals did not stop elective procedures and maintaining community-focused care, with a strong emphasis on primary health care and preventive medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.
*   **Korea:** Divided care facilities into three levels (general hospitals for severe cases, living care centers for moderate cases, and home isolation for mild cases) to manage patient flow and prevent overcrowding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. This segregation of patient pathways helped manage the dual crisis without a significant increase in mortality from other diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

## Reimagining Public Health Systems for Overlapping Challenges

The pandemic has underscored that public health is a complex issue intertwined with the economy, jobs, education, and transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.

### Incorporating Broader Policy Goals
*   **Ireland:** Increased public health funding by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a> and is implementing a "launch of care" program focused on supporting health and well-being for vulnerable people and delivering care in the right place at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. Politicians largely followed expert advice, recognizing that the health service has been empowered and is no longer a "political football" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
*   **Latvia:** The Minister of Health expressed hope that the crisis would end the long-standing "health versus economy" or "health versus political issues" false dilemma, recognizing that an adequate response to pandemics relies on universal health care and health promotion, which are deeply tied to socio-economic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.
*   **Sweden:** The crisis accelerated existing trends like digitalization and patient-centeredness but also forced a rethinking of society's dependence on timely delivery and lack of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>. This has led to a focus on adaptive preparedness systems and greater [[collaboration_between_governments_and_civil_society_organizations | collaboration with civil society and industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>.
*   **Korea:** The pandemic led to a realization among the Korean public that the health system needs to be redesigned towards a more public sector-dominant system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>. The concept of "human security" at a national level, where health issues are deeply linked with other sectors, has become paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>.

## Future Directions and Personal Commitments

The pandemic has certainly accelerated existing trends, particularly in digital health, with processes previously met with resistance being implemented in days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. This shift to digital medicine is irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>. The crisis also highlighted the need for governments to realize the economic impact of underfunding healthcare and the necessity of maintaining safety margins for health systems, as pandemics are likely to recur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>.

Panelists shared personal commitments for future action:
*   **Ran (Israel):** To remember that a crisis is "not over until it's over," advocating for sustained vigilance in public health to avoid repeating past mistakes driven by hubris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
*   **Ilse (Latvia):** To focus more on tackling societal inequalities, recognizing their direct link to how people behave during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>.
*   **Sun Min (Korea):** To continue building a sound healthcare delivery system, emphasizing universal health coverage as critically important for a resilient and prepared health system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.
*   **Olivia (Sweden):** To speed up agency processes for developing knowledge and data-driven analysis, increase the use of health data registers, and provide clearer priorities and tighter [[public_sector_innovation and collaboration | collaboration]] within the healthcare sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.
*   **Frank (Ireland):** To delegate the importance of technology in care delivery (e.g., telehealth, e-prescribing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>, and to build on [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | global communication structures]] with organizations like the EU and WHO, as national responses alone are insufficient for global problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

The pandemic has undeniably demonstrated that [[collaborative_approaches_in_public_sector_innovation | collaboration]] at all levels – from individuals and communities to national governments and international organizations – is essential for effective public health governance and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>.

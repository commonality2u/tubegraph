## Introduction to Mission-Oriented Innovation

[[Mission oriented innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is a concept designed to tackle complex societal challenges by directing growth and innovation towards specific goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It emphasizes a departure from traditional "market fixing" approaches, instead promoting "market shaping" and "market co-creation" between public and private sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. The approach aims to integrate purpose into the core of how public policy and economic systems operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

This framework is seen as a crucial part of an [[Mission oriented innovation strategies and practices | innovation portfolio approach]], particularly effective for addressing urgent problems and complex challenges faced by public sectors and societies today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. It requires a shift in how organizations think and work, emphasizing collaboration, risk-taking, and adaptive strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Core Principles of Mission-Oriented Innovation

### Market Shaping vs. Market Fixing
Traditional policy often views the state's role as merely "fixing markets" when they fail or filling gaps where the private sector doesn't invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. [[Mission oriented innovation]] advocates for a "market shaping" or "market co-creating" role for the public sector, actively setting direction and fostering new landscapes and markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. This means going beyond just correcting for positive externalities or asymmetric information problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

### Directionality of Growth
A key aspect is directing economic growth towards specific goals, rather than just focusing on the rate of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. This is particularly relevant in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed upon by the United Nations since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. Missions help ensure growth is more inclusive, sustainable, and innovation-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

### Role of the Public Sector
The public sector is seen as an "investor of first resort" rather than just a "lender of last resort," willing to take on significant risks necessary for transformative change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. This involves sharing risks and rewards with the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. It also means building internal capabilities and acting as a "learning organization" to learn from failures and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

### Co-creation and Collaboration
[[Mission oriented innovation]] necessitates collaboration across multiple actors and sectors, including public, private, and third sectors, as well as engaging citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. This involves:
*   **Quadruple Helix Model**: Collaboration between researchers, entrepreneurs, government, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:41">[01:42:41]</a>.
*   **Cross-disciplinary and Cross-sectoral Engagement**: Bringing together different policy fields, disciplines, and sectors, including humanities and social sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
*   **Bottom-up Experimentation**: While setting broad directions, missions should foster multiple bottom-up solutions and localized initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

### Mission Criteria
According to Mariana Mazzucato's work, missions typically meet five key criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>:
1.  **Bold and Inspirational**: Fosters new thinking and identifies future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.
2.  **Clear, Directed, and Targeted**: Provides a specific focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.
3.  **Cross-disciplinary**: Requires inputs from various academic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.
4.  **Cross-actor**: Involves public, private, and third sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
5.  **Drives Multiple Bottom-up Solutions**: Encourages diverse experimentation and problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_health_missions | Challenges and Strategies in Implementing Health Missions]]

Implementing [[Mission oriented innovation]] faces several [[Mission oriented innovation challenges and implementation | challenges and implementation]] issues:

### Organizational and Cultural Challenges
*   **Siloed Thinking**: Governments often operate in silos, with incentive structures and procurement processes that discourage collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. Missions need to be positioned at the center of economic growth discussions, not just confined to specific ministries like innovation or environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion**: Public agents, particularly decision-makers, often feel pressured by how they will be evaluated, leading to risk aversion rather than embracing experimentation and failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.
*   **Lack of Internal Capabilities**: There has been significant outsourcing of public sector capacity globally, hindering the ability of public organizations to act as learning organizations and take on new, complex roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy and Administrative Instruments**: Existing administrative structures and rules can impede mission implementation, requiring significant reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36">[01:33:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:59">[01:33:59]</a>.

### Defining and Measuring Missions
*   **Clear Targets and Timelines**: Many initiatives labeled as "mission-oriented" lack clear targets, deadlines, or timelines, resembling "mission washing" where existing industrial targeting is re-labeled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on Technological vs. Societal Solutions**: Most existing mission-oriented policies tend to focus on scientific and technological solutions, with fewer initiatives addressing broader social or behavioral changes required for societal transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.
*   **Evaluation Challenges**: Traditional evaluation tools (e.g., cost-benefit analysis) are often insufficient for assessing the dynamic spillovers and broader impacts of [[Mission oriented innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>. There is a need for more dynamic metrics that capture systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.

### Implementation and Scaling Challenges
*   **Articulation of Supply-Push and Demand-Side Instruments**: Integrating different measures like supply-push and demand-side instruments can be administratively complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.
*   **Scaling Up Pilots**: Many [[Mission oriented innovation | mission-oriented policies]] remain pilot projects. Scaling them up to achieve transformative effect requires elevating the mission framework to higher levels of policy making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.
*   **Managing Stakeholder Diversity**: Enlisting many stakeholders in broad, overarching missions risks diluting the mission or creating too many objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.
*   **Power Dynamics**: Multi-level governance structures, while important, can mask strong tensions and power conflicts among various committees and actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>.

## [[Mission setting and policy making | Mission Setting and Policy Making]] Strategies

### Defining Missions
*   **Start with Broad Challenges**: Instead of focusing on lists of sectors, identify key societal challenges (e.g., climate change, future of mobility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Outcomes-Oriented Approach**: Missions should be defined by the desired outcomes (e.g., carbon neutrality), which then require innovation across diverse sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.
*   **Place-Based Innovation**: Using specific environments like a "street," "school," or "forest" as mission themes forces systemic thinking and direct engagement with people in that place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.
*   **Involve Experts in Everyday Life**: Engage people who are directly involved in the problem or daily context, like school kids redesigning streets, as they are "experts" in their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:28">[01:16:28]</a>.
*   **Iterative Design**: Mission creation is a long, sequential process, not a one-off stage. The true mission often emerges from bottom-up projects and ongoing determination of targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>.

### Policy and Governance
*   **Broaden the Scope**: Elevate missions beyond just innovation policy to the core of economic growth and broader public policy (e.g., the Green Deal in the EU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.
*   **Coordinated Package of Measures**: Missions are not fragmented measures but coordinated bundles of research, innovation, policy, and regulatory measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>.
*   **Multi-Level Governance**: Establish nested cross-ministerial and cross-agency governance structures to foster collaboration across different parts of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.
*   **Delegated Mission Programs**: Grant specific authority to stakeholders for co-creating the agenda, as seen in Scandinavian countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Implementation Strategies and Practices

### Engagement and Collaboration
*   **"System in the Room" Workshops**: Convene diverse stakeholders from the "front line" (e.g., local transport authorities, companies, social sector, school kids, regulators) to build system maps and co-create solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:23">[01:58:23]</a>.
*   **Continuous Engagement**: [[Mission oriented innovation]] requires ongoing engagement, not a "fire and forget" approach, to sustain long-term commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Listen to Underrepresented Voices**: Actively seek perspectives from those who normally don't have a say, as this is crucial for mitigating unintended consequences and fostering inclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:29">[02:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:51">[02:03:51]</a>.
*   **Build Relationships**: The success of collaborations fundamentally relies on trusted personal relationships, mutual understanding, and a shared vision among partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:37">[02:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:47">[02:05:47]</a>.

### Funding and Investment
*   **Leverage Existing Investments**: Focus on redirecting existing budgets and large-scale public sector investments (e.g., city budgets, school food system budgets) towards mission outcomes, rather than relying solely on new innovation funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:41">[01:20:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:21">[02:04:21]</a>.
*   **Conditionalities**: Public loans and recovery funds can include conditions (e.g., carbon emission reduction, no tax havens) to steer private sector behavior towards public goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Approach**: Manage a portfolio of innovations aligned with missions, allowing for diversification of risk and maximizing impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>.

### Experimentation and Learning
*   **Prototypes**: Use prototypes and pilot experiments to gather understanding, build political capital, and provide evidence from the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>. These can be designed for scalability from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>.
*   **Learning Organizations**: Frame public organizations as learning entities that actively make investments to learn from trial and error, even when failures occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Processes**: Be flexible and open to adapting the mission and its implementation as new information and collaborations emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">[02:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:33">[02:02:33]</a>.

### Communication and Narrative
*   **Change the Storytelling**: Shift the narrative about public policy from one of "de-risking" or "facilitating" to one of "risk-sharing," "co-creating," and "value creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:02">[02:09:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:01">[02:10:01]</a>.
*   **Adapt Terminology**: Not everyone needs to understand the full theoretical framework of missions. Communicate in language relevant to different stakeholders and slowly build understanding of the broader concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:03">[02:07:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>.

### Examples of Mission Implementation in Practice

*   **Sweden (Vinnova)**:
    *   **Sustainable Streets**: Transformed existing street infrastructure (40,000 km) to produce healthy, sustainable, vibrant environments by involving local actors and school children in redesigning parking spaces into social and green areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>. This unlocks diverse value (biodiversity, mental health) beyond just traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>.
    *   **School Food**: Redirected the existing budget for school meals (2 million meals/day) from a focus on cost and hygiene to sustainability, health, and regenerative agriculture, involving co-creation with hundreds of organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.

*   **Spain (ENISA)**:
    *   **Pilot Missions**: Focused on industry, gender equality, territorial balance, and impact investment. Four specific missions identified: redesigning mobility, universal access to housing (new edification), secure health, and rural agri-food activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:46">[01:25:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.
    *   **Bottom-up Discovery**: Emphasizes coordinating conversations from the bottom-up, with a focus on entrepreneurs and innovative SMEs as disruptive agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:20">[01:28:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:23">[01:28:23]</a>.
    *   **Local Ecosystems**: Crucial role for local entrepreneurship ecosystems and networks in implementing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:54">[01:28:54]</a>.

*   **Netherlands (Health Holland)**:
    *   **Health and Care Missions**: Focused on living longer in good health and decreasing health inequalities, with supporting missions on lifestyle, environment, care availability, chronic diseases, and dementia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:49">[01:40:49]</a>.
    *   **Quadruple Helix Co-creation**: Strong emphasis on co-creation involving researchers, entrepreneurs, government, and citizens, facilitating connections between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:41">[01:42:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>.
    *   **Starting with Needs**: Instead of imposing solutions, they begin with initiatives that meet needs at the local level (e.g., Tom de Luza village for dementia care) and then scale them to fit the broader system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:52">[01:44:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:10">[01:45:10]</a>.

*   **UK (Royal Academy of Engineering / Engineering X)**:
    *   **Global Challenges**: Uses its global network of engineers to address complex, global engineering challenges, focusing on diffusing existing knowledge and targeted innovation solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:46">[01:49:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:08">[01:51:08]</a>.
    *   **"Safer End of Engineered Life" Mission**: Aims to improve the safe disposal and decommissioning of engineered artifacts globally (e.g., ships, medical devices), particularly focusing on addressing unsafe practices like open burning of waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:35">[01:53:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:36">[01:54:36]</a>.
    *   **Adaptive Design**: The mission framework helps navigate uncertainty by mapping stakeholders and structuring broad issues into manageable challenges, allowing for learning and adaptation during implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:21">[01:55:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>.
    *   **Funding and Community Building**: Develops funding programs (e.g., for collaboration) and actively builds a coalition of diverse people globally to affect real change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:06">[02:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:09">[02:02:09]</a>.

The experience of the COVID-19 recovery schemes, such as those in France (Renault and Air France committing to lower carbon emissions) and Denmark (companies receiving funds cannot use tax havens), illustrates how the "missions concept" can be brought into the mainstream of public and private sector collaboration through conditionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.

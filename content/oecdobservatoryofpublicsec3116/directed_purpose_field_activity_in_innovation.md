Innovation can be understood based on two important variables: whether it is a directed activity and how radical or incremental it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Definition and Characteristics

[[Mission_oriented_innovation | Directed purpose field activity]] refers to innovation efforts that have a clear mandate to solve a specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This means knowing precisely what innovation is needed for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Examples of such clear mandates include solving homelessness, poverty, or climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The presence or absence of this direction is a crucial variable in defining innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Connection to [[Mission_oriented_innovation | Mission-Oriented Innovation]]

When innovation is linked to a [[mission_oriented_innovation | directed purpose field activity]], it is categorized as [[mission_oriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This concept has been explored by Mariana Mazzucato at UCL, focusing on how to address the most significant missions of today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Contrast with Other Innovation Types

Depending on the variables of direction and uncertainty (or calculated risks), different facets of public sector innovation emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Beyond [[mission_oriented_innovation | directed purpose field activity]], other types of innovation include:

### Adaptive Innovation
This occurs during exploration activities where there isn't a clear direction for where innovation is headed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Innovators explore new ideas through trial practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Anticipatory Innovation
This type of innovation is relevant when there is deep uncertainty, a need for exploration of new ideas, and an expectation of radical transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It involves anticipating future transformations and working on ideas that might be quite radical to existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | Enhancement-Oriented Innovation]]
This category applies when the focus is on improving or enhancing systems that are already in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

These four key areas of public sector innovation each require different approaches to direction, strategy, capacity, and allowance for innovation within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

This article summarizes discussions from the Government Aftershock high-level Forum, which convened a global dialogue on the crisis and its revelations about the role and expectations of government now and in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The event, titled "Building Back Better Together and Reaffirming the Role of Citizen-Centered Governance," involved over 4,500 participants in more than 60 local conversations worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## The Imperative for Citizen Engagement
The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the need for deeper and quicker citizen engagement in policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Governments require citizens to be engaged, understand, and comply with measures to effectively deal with crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. A poll conducted during the forum revealed that 89.3% of participants believe there is a greater need to engage with citizens now than before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### Government Perspectives
*   **Costa Rica:** While public services are centered on service delivery, existing instruments and means have shown limitations in tailoring to every citizen's expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The crisis has revealed that many tasks can be automated, but this also delays the social and economic consequences of moving away from public officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. There is a need to boost shared responsibility frameworks, including Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), decent work legislation, and blended finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The government must balance routines and technical criteria with citizen expectations to identify what is useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. Citizens are willing to participate in implementation and monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
*   **Scotland:** Scotland already had a strong focus on citizen participation through its national performance framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The pandemic intensified this, leading to additional engagement measures such as weekly polls to gauge understanding and compliance with government messages, and daily press briefings led by the First Minister and senior officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Higher compliance and trust correlate with greater information availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Scotland's approach to policing during the pandemic emphasizes "engage, explain, encourage, and only if needed enforce," embodying a citizen-based approach with public consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. The government places a great emphasis on "lived experience" to inform policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

### Civil Society's Role
Civil society groups have shown high agility in responding to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. They have been:
*   **Fast Responders:** Community-based organizations reached the most vulnerable populations, often addressing issues overlooked by government priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.
*   **Safeguards Against Misinformation:** Civil society and citizens are crucial in combating misinformation by finding innovative ways to campaign and raise awareness, including through art like graffiti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.
*   **Frontline in Accountability and Transparency:** They monitor the distribution of aid and services and demand greater visibility regarding foreign funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.
*   **Innovators:** Civil society has innovated by engaging more in digital spaces, adapting people to virtual engagement, and demanding access to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>. They also utilize existing participatory approaches with local governments and municipalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. Even with restrictions on civic space, citizens and civil society continued to help governments respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

## Challenges to Engagement
*   **Digital Divide:** Access to digital platforms for engagement is often skewed towards the more advantaged, leaving out rural, elderly, or less socially privileged populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.
*   **Misinformation and Conspiracy Theories:** These factors drive non-compliance with public health measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Governments struggle to compete with fake news, making it difficult for citizens to identify truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>.
*   **Restriction of Civic Space:** Attempts to control the pandemic have led to restrictions on freedoms, including censorship, limits on access to information, threats, arrests for criticizing state responses, and crackdowns on protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   **Complexity of Policies:** Policy proposals have become technically complex, making it crucial to render them understandable for non-expert populations to foster engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
*   **Siloed Government Operations:** Traditional government structures can hinder a combined, cross-cutting approach needed for multi-dimensional policy challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

## Strategies for Effective and Resilient Engagement
*   **Digital Platforms:** These are the easiest tools in a pandemic, but require moderation to ensure equality of voice and prevent takeover by vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. Call-outs on prime-time TV can encourage participation from ordinary citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>.
*   **In-Depth Survey Work:** Providing citizens with evidence before asking for their input and then explaining how their feedback influenced decisions can build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.
*   **Deliberative Engagement:** Involving citizens directly with experts, allowing them to ask questions and report back to their peers, is a powerful way to correct misperceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This approach leverages the "citizens' own voices" to validate scientific consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Approach for Inclusion:** Recognizing the limitations of virtual engagement, a hybrid approach is needed that leverages community-based organizations and local champions to reach those without digital access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. Innovations like offline discussion solutions can also be explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.
*   **Humility in Government:** Governments need to acknowledge they don't have all the answers and be open to listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This means engaging directly with communities to understand their lived experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
*   **Actionable Feedback:** It is crucial that citizens see their input resulting in action; ignoring feedback can breed cynicism rather than trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

## [[partnerships_between_public_sector_and_private_sector_for_innovation | Cross-Sector Collaboration]] for [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] and Resilience
The discussion highlighted the importance of collaboration beyond traditional government silos.

*   **Public-Private Partnerships:** While some direct government-private sector partnerships exist, such as entrepreneurs investing in universities and working with government and communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>, there is also a focus on cross-working across public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.
*   **Inter-Agency Collaboration:** Scotland uses "Improvement Science" to bring public agencies together to address missions or challenges, breaking out of silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>. Examples include treating knife crime as a public health crisis and early years interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.
*   **Empowering Citizens as Contributors:** Citizens are not just recipients of services but also implementers and contributors to public policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. Their involvement helps ensure government performance and supports democratic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Shifting Relationships:** There needs to be a radical shift from a "market approach" where citizens are seen as clients, to one of genuine partnership and collaboration, recognizing citizens as the source of legitimacy and trust for governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. This means moving from "service delivery" to "co-designing solutions and services together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:19">[02:00:19]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Future Outlook
The crisis has accelerated changes in how governments engage with citizens, moving away from formal consultation methods that often empower only specific groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. Key lessons include:
*   **Agility and Speed:** Governments can do things at speed and get feedback quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.
*   **Embracing Uncertainty:** It's acceptable not to have all the answers from the start; processes can evolve with evidence and adapt to changing circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on the "How":** Beyond frameworks and descriptions, the focus needs to be on the practical "how" of empowering people, businesses, and communities to drive change from the bottom up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.
*   **Building Resilience:** There is a need to build the resilience of systems, society, and communities to respond to future shocks more effectively and address pre-existing societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a>.
*   **Sustainability Through Inclusion:** Historical crises demonstrate that sustainability of responses comes through inclusion, ensuring everyone impacted is part of the decision-making cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>.

There is a strong commitment from panelists to integrate these lessons, emphasizing the need to continuously ask "who are we leaving behind?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>, improve digital tools, and acknowledge that solutions require ongoing adaptation and pilot experiences rather than pretending to have all the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. The importance of radical civic space and fundamental freedoms as the foundation for sustainable engagement was also underscored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.

The increasing prevalence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and technology demands a fundamental shift in public understanding and engagement to ensure informed public policy decisions and societal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

## The Societal Cost of AI Mystification

Artificial Intelligence is a widely discussed topic, often encountered through science fiction or media that presents it in a highly mystified manner, filled with myths and less scientific explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. This "societal cost of the mystification of AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a> hinders the general public from participating in essential discourse needed to regulate AI and digital technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.

AI and digital technologies are tools that can be used for good or ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>. Harmful uses, such as social media filter bubbles or political polarization, involve complex, multifaceted problems that extend beyond purely technological issues, deeply embedding themselves within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. The crucial decisions on how societies will thrive in the age of AI are political, not just technological, requiring the ability to regulate and direct AI's use for improved well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

To address this, it's necessary to:
*   Dispense with myths and engage in rational, fact-based discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>.
*   Encourage experts who have learned about AI to reach out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
*   Ensure journalists do not distort messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.
*   Empower the general public to be more critical consumers of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.

The fundamental solution is accessible [[learning_and_capacity_building_in_government | AI education]] for everyone, available at all levels, not just for university experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. This helps build [[digital_media_literacy_and_misinformation | digital media literacy and combat misinformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.

## Elements of AI: A Case Study in Public Education

The "Elements of AI" initiative, a free online course from the University of Helsinki, aims to improve the general public's AI literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. Launched over two years ago, it has garnered over half a million participants globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.

Key features of the "Elements of AI" course:
*   **Accessibility**: No coding or complex math is required, making it suitable for all audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.
*   **Curriculum**: It focuses on understanding how people process and interpret complex data to build automation, delves into underlying AI techniques, and explores the societal implications and impact on societal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:42:17]</a>.
*   **Outreach**: Beyond just an online course, it's an initiative with grassroot activities and local campaigns in various languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. Campaigns launched in Sweden, Estonia, Germany (2019), and Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, France, Belgium, Malta, Ireland, Poland, Croatia, and Italy (2020-2021), aiming for all EU countries by summer 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>.
*   **Diversity**: The course boasts diverse participation, with 38% global female users, and over 50% female users in Finland and Nordic countries, which is unusual for computer science courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. It attracts users of all ages, including those 80-90 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.
*   **Awards**: It is rated as a top AI/computer science course on Class Central and is a finalist for the Innovation in Politics Award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.

## Upskilling and Empowering for Innovation

A follow-up course, "Building AI," was launched to offer more technical content and programming, aiming to [[empowering_public_servants_with_tools_and_insights | upskill people]] for innovation in AI and digital technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. The goal is to transform individuals from AI consumers into contributors, enabling them to better work with and manage [[artificial_intelligence_in_public_administration | AI projects]] and contribute to discussions around [[the_role_of_ai_and_technology_in_public_administration | the role of AI and technology in public administration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.

This initiative reinforces the idea that [[artificial_intelligence_in_public_administration | AI is for everyone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. By understanding how AI works, individuals can form more educated opinions on its application, leading to greater involvement in public policy dialogues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>.

## Leveraging Innovative Momentum

The COVID-19 pandemic has served as an "unfortunate catalyst" for innovation, accelerating developments that might have taken years or decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>. This period has also highlighted the importance of government, especially in partnership with other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

To leverage this momentum, it is crucial to:
*   Maintain the accelerated pace of innovation seen in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
*   Prioritize public-private-NGO partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a>.
*   Focus on areas most impacted by the crisis, such as mental health and accessibility to services and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
*   Balance urgent short-term innovation with long-term commitments, such as the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>.
*   Capitalize on the increased trust in science to address global challenges like the climate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>.
*   Recognize that "change is possible," as demonstrated during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>.

A critical challenge is ensuring that the benefits of new innovations are "equally beneficial to all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. There is a risk of expanding the knowledge or skills gap if online education and other digital advancements are not universally accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. This requires new innovations to ensure equitable distribution of positive [[impact_of_insights_on_public_policy | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

Governments, like the UAE, have proactively restructured to be more agile and responsive, establishing roles such as Minister of State for Government Development, Digital Economy, and [[artificial_intelligence_in_public_administration | Artificial Intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:28">[01:09:28]</a>. This forward-thinking approach views crisis as an opportunity to accelerate existing plans and make bold changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.

This article explores the experiences of Canada and France in developing and utilizing declarations and manifestos to spur public sector innovation, drawing from a discussion hosted by the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The session featured insights from representatives of both countries, along with reflections from OPSI analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Canada's Declaration on Public Sector Innovation

Rodney from Canada shared the nation's journey with its declaration on public sector innovation, which has been in place for a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Genesis and Context
The initiative began in 2015 when the heads of public services across Canada, totaling 14 individuals, started quarterly discussions on common issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Canada operates under a federated model of governance, encompassing federal, provincial, and territorial governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Discussions shifted towards public service renewal, emphasizing the need for the public service to keep pace with external changes, transform, and remain relevant to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Key challenges identified included how to effectively use data, leverage digital technologies, and engage citizens in [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | co-creating and co-designing solutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Over several years, these discussions led to annual gatherings focused on [[public_sector_innovation_systems_in_canada | public sector innovation]], eventually coalescing around the idea of a declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Purpose and Nature
The declaration is non-binding but serves to send a clear signal across all public service systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. It signifies that public service leaders care about issues like trying new things, taking risks, testing ideas, and acknowledging that not everything will work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The ultimate goal is to deliver better policies and programs to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Drafted in early 2017, the declaration is an aspirational document codifying aspects like new partnerships, data utilization, technology, and funding models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. It was recognized that with a large public service (250,000 federal employees, up to 700,000 across all levels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, a declaration was needed to resonate with everyone and empower them to pursue new and transformative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Implementation and Impact
The declaration was signed in November 2017, marking the first time all heads of public services in Canada signed a joint document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. It has been used as a "signpost," pointing to it when developing new policies and programs to inform decision-makers that they are "given a license to do these types of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

It also facilitates engagement with provincial and territorial colleagues, fostering discussions about trying new ideas together, and "de-risking" through collective effort, as "safer in numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Reactions and Challenges
The declaration was generally well-received or acknowledged neutrally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. There was no direct negative backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. However, it's acknowledged that while the declaration helps move the idea of trying new things from "side of desk" to "center of desk," the public sector still needs to make further gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. [[experimentation_and_learning_in_government | Innovation and experimentation]] within government are still in their "infancy or adolescent phase," not yet a mainstream way of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

## France's Manifesto for Public Sector Innovation

Benoit presented France's experience with its "French manifesto for [[public_sector_innovation_systems_in_canada | public sector innovation]]," released in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Motivation and Purpose
The manifesto emerged from a growing interest in innovation within French administration, exemplified by the creation of a new generation of public labs across most French regions in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. There was an expectation to define public sector innovation in the French context and provide guidelines, as many new public servants were discovering concepts like "lab," "design," and "experimentation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The goal was to provide guidance based on what works and doesn't, and to ensure that innovation wasn't just a fleeting "fashion" but a serious approach that could yield significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. It aimed to position innovation as "a new approach to public policymaking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. The manifesto is a six-page document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

### Key Outcomes and Impact
The manifesto provided a common reference text, something official and national to rely on and promote public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. It gave a basis and legitimacy to public servants, particularly those new to design or behavioral sciences, helping them demonstrate that their work is serious and impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

It has been a main tool in developing a community of "public sector innovators," which now numbers 600-700 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This community is united by a shared vision and mindset, with the ultimate goal of changing the culture of French public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### Backlash and Limitations
Initially, there were difficulties in getting the manifesto endorsed by leadership, with concerns that it might be "too early" or that the administration wasn't "mature" enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Even after release, some hostility and a lack of seriousness from many in top administration persist, as they may not understand or wish to work differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

The manifesto is acknowledged as a "step ahead" and has driven some political support, but it's "not enough to transform our governments" on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. The transformation is still in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## Reflections on Declarations for Public Sector Innovation

Alex Roberts from OPSI highlighted several commonalities and underlying principles for such declarations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>:

*   **Unifying efforts:** [[international_trends_in_governmental_experimentation_and_innovation | Innovation]] inherently pushes activity towards contextual patterns, so declarations help bring diverse efforts together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
*   **Signaling importance:** They signal that [[international_trends_in_governmental_experimentation_and_innovation | innovation]] matters and is part of "how we do things," not merely an add-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.
*   **Contextual relevance:** The OECD's draft declaration is based on extensive work with countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, including a [[public_sector_innovation_systems_in_canada | public sector innovation system study]] with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
*   **Strategic importance:** While not always needed, [[international_trends_in_governmental_experimentation_and_innovation | innovation]] is increasingly crucial for governments to address modern challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
*   **Systemic embedding:** The aim is to embed innovation as a more systemic activity across government, moving beyond the historical rate of innovation to match current needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

### Multi-faceted Innovation
The term "innovation" is broad, covering many concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. The OECD seeks to build a more accessible language by "unpacking" the word, recognizing that innovation is multifaceted and requires different forms of appreciation and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. OPSI introduces "innovation facets":
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation:** Improving existing practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented innovation:** Achieving ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation:** Responding to a changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation:** Engaging with "weak signals" early to shape change rather than just react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

Governments must maintain a "portfolio approach" to innovation, hedging bets across these facets to be ready for challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. The declaration aims to codify this language, telling a richer story about why innovation matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

### Role of Public Servants
The declaration emphasizes that all public servants have a role in innovation, not just specialists in labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. This includes being an innovator, a recipient of innovation, or simply supportive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. It seeks to mature the conversation around innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. Key elements to embrace and enhance include:
*   Acknowledging existing innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   Equipping public servants for their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
*   Forming new partnerships and involving diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
*   Recognizing innovation as an evolving practice requiring continuous learning and sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

### Engagement and Future Outlook
The OECD's draft declaration aims to be a useful and valuable tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. The public consultation process, which ran from November 2018 to February 22, 2019, sought feedback on clarity, terminology (e.g., "weak signals," "civil servant" vs. "public servant"), and the feasibility of proposed actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. For instance, feedback highlighted the need to stress that "failure is part of an [[experimentation_and_learning_in_government | experimentation]]" as a distinct activity for auditing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

The declaration, if affirmed by member countries, would be an official but not legally binding OECD instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. Its purpose is to signal the importance of innovation and provide guidance for national innovation strategies, encouraging a portfolio approach to managing diverse innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.

[[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | Citizen participation]] is considered a crucial part of an effective [[public_sector_innovation_systems_in_canada | public sector innovation]] process, encouraging governments to seek and listen to diverse voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. The OECD also actively researches leadership mindsets and skills needed for innovation competency, recognizing that different leadership forms and diverse players are required at various stages of the innovation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

Governmental innovation and reform are essential for addressing complex and interrelated issues, yet the public sector faces numerous obstacles in fostering and sustaining these efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Despite progress, a significant amount of work remains to be done to integrate innovation strategically within government operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Core Challenges in Public Sector Innovation

The journey towards effective governmental innovation is a continuous learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Key [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | challenges]] include:

*   **Cautious Government Context** The inherent caution within government contexts makes it difficult to openly share experiences and embrace new approaches to [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Sensitive Issues and Status Quo** Raising sensitive issues that challenge the status quo, such as the relationship between political leaders and the civil service, or establishing supportive framework conditions for innovation, proves difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Complex and Interrelated Issues** Governments are confronted with a "Perma crisis" of multiple, parallel crises, including health, energy, climate, geopolitical dependencies, and a crisis of the welfare state model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. These occur within a context of tight public finances, inflation, and potential recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. The increasing public demand for engagement, accountability, and democratic governance further complicates matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion and Failure** Public sector organizations are often characterized by risk aversion and a fear of failure, hindering experimental approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>.
*   **Inadequate Internal Capabilities** Organizations often do not invest sufficiently in developing internal dynamic capabilities through HR or training, focusing instead on project funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

## Limitations of Current Approaches

Traditional approaches often fall short in addressing the depth of change required:

*   **Reactive Modes** Focusing solely on adaptation to new circumstances traps governments in reactive modes, leading to solutions that arrive too late and draw criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **Incremental Improvement** Incremental improvements to existing systems fail to address the underlying problems of institutional setups and mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. For example, simply digitizing existing "red tape" without cutting it is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. A "step change" is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Strategic, Long-Term View** There is a need for a long-term strategic approach that bridges multiple political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   **Fragmentation** Public sector innovation efforts often suffer from fragmentation between different projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>.

## The Professionalization of Innovation

Despite the [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | challenges]], there is a trend towards professionalizing innovation in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. Countries have begun to institutionalize practices and concrete measures to support [[Challenges and strategies in implementing public sector innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

## Necessary Changes for Effective Innovation

To overcome these [[public_sector_innovation_challenges | challenges]], governments must embrace radical changes and new capabilities:

*   **Radical Changes in Working Methods** This includes flexibility, digitization, and hybrid working methods, requiring administrations to collaborate with citizens and actors in the innovation system to better utilize these methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
*   **New Organizational Frameworks** Organizations need new conditions conducive to innovation and capacity building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Mission-Oriented Innovation** Designing missions that engage all innovation ecosystem actors in game-changing common endeavors is one approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. This involves setting long-term transformational goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.
*   **Future-Oriented Stance** Governments need to anticipate future developments to build strength and meet future [[Challenges requiring government innovation | challenges]], and to develop a collective vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Approach to Innovation** Viewing innovation as a portfolio of initiatives that work together towards common goals is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. This approach helps manage risks across public sector activities, generates synergies, and avoids fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. It promotes balancing different types of innovation (e.g., enhancement, adaptive, mission-oriented, anticipatory) to avoid blind spots and lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Portfolio Management** Building new capabilities around dynamic portfolio management enables organizations to leverage their portfolio as a learning mechanism, designing interventions from a sense of where they are in a system and where they need to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. This involves dealing with emerging information and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Orchestration** Missions require galvanizing the broader innovation ecosystem, including industry, business, scientific community, and civil society, which necessitates strong stakeholder engagement and co-creation abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. This is a significant [[Challenges in implementing innovation in the public sector | challenge]] for administrations accustomed to consultation cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.
*   **Measuring and Tracking Success** While direct "measurement" can be difficult for complex systems, tracking portfolio activities, stakeholder involvement, investment levels, and the impact of events can provide valuable insights into progress and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:26:00">[51:26:00]</a>. Korea, for instance, emphasizes data-driven public administration and evidence-based policy making, using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, often relying on open innovation and collaborations with think tanks and academic societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:35:00">[53:35:00]</a>.

## Examples of Addressing Challenges

*   **Austria** The Austrian Federal Ministry for the Civil Service uses the innovation facets model as an abstract model for discussion and in training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>. They map projects like their quality management tool (Common Assessment Framework) as "enhancement-oriented innovation" and initiatives like "Future of Work" and "Digital Public Administration and Ethics" as "anticipatory innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>. Projects like "Greening Commutes and Duty Travels" are classified as "mission-oriented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:00">[38:07:00]</a>.
*   **Sweden** Future by Lund, an innovation platform, focuses on working with external actors across the city (municipality, companies, university, research institutes) to foster innovation for sustainable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>. They use a "zone model" overlaid with the innovation facets model to track activities and encourage ideas to move forward in innovation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:00">[43:30:00]</a>. Their portfolio approach provides a holistic view for stakeholders, identifies gaps, tracks accumulated projects, and visualizes the ecosystem's strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:06:00">[46:06:00]</a>.
*   **Korea** The government of Korea uses mission-oriented and anticipatory innovation to encourage the use of data, technologies, social media, and platforms to improve governmental accountability, social inclusiveness, open government, and digital government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>.
*   **European Commission** The European Commission's Horizon Europe program (budgeting 95.5 billion EUR) includes five ambitious missions with clear targets, managed by relevant policy services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. This structure embeds research and innovation into mainstream policymaking, but also makes mission management more complex due to standard decision-making rules and public scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. While the Commission lacks an overarching innovation strategy, individual services experiment with "participatory leadership" and large-scale staff engagements to break silos and foster collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>.
*   **UAE** The UAE government adopts a portfolio approach to innovation as "second nature," setting ambitious visions and launching transformative programs with ministers committing to delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>. The Ministry of Possibilities works on mission-oriented innovation for "wicked policy challenges," and the country is part of the Agile Nations Network, unafraid to try untested ideas like the world's first regulatory authority for digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:33:00">[32:33:00]</a>. The Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation collaborates with OPSI to collect and showcase global innovation cases, enriching their portfolio with new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>.

The ability to innovate is core to government effectiveness and stability, particularly in turbulent times and in the context of complex and interrelated [[challenges_requiring_government_innovation | challenges requiring government innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

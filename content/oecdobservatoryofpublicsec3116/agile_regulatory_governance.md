[[agile_regulatory_approaches | Agile regulatory governance]] is a crucial approach for governments seeking to navigate a rapidly changing world. It involves rethinking how regulations are devised, developed, and implemented to manage risks and harness the opportunities presented by interconnectedness and technological change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

## Context and Necessity
The need for [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile regulatory governance]] has been amplified by recent global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted and exacerbated pre-existing challenges in public administration and regulatory policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Key drivers for this shift include:
*   **Interconnected Risks and Opportunities** – The world is characterized by interconnected risks and opportunities, with economic globalization showcasing opportunities, and events like COVID-19 demonstrating the risks of interconnectedness, affecting nearly every global citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:18">[02:18:18]</a>.
*   **Rapid Technological Change and Innovation** – While technology presents incredible opportunities, many technologies scale quickly before their potential risks or harms are fully understood. Governments often struggle to establish governance "guard rails" fast enough to prevent harm to citizens or markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This requires rethinking how regulations are developed and implemented to guide innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Balancing Speed and Inclusion** – There's a constant tension between the political expectation for quick action and results, and the need for stakeholders to be involved and consulted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Exclusion can cause "pain" (as shown by brain scan studies), emphasizing the need for collaboration and cooperation in regulatory issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

## Key Principles and Recommendations (OECD)
The OECD's Regulatory Policy Committee has developed a recommendation on [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile governance]] to harness [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:07]</a>. These recommendations, adopted in October, are ambitious but aim to enhance a more adaptive approach to regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. They include:

*   **Adjust Regulatory Management Tools** – Regulations should be "fit for the future" and understood as tools to shape desired future outcomes. This requires foresight and tools to work with the "fuzzy" concept of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. Collaboration and consultation with the public and stakeholders are essential for this future-oriented approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.
*   **Provide Institutional Foundation for Cooperation** – Creating frameworks that enable cooperation and joined-up approaches within and across jurisdictions is vital. This is challenging under time pressure but is possible, as demonstrated by examples like the Montreal Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
*   **Develop Governance Frameworks for Horizon Scanning and Data** – Frameworks should include horizon scanning, scenario analysis, and monitoring of regulatory implications, relying heavily on data. Regulations should be outcome-focused, measuring real-life effects against stated goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.
*   **Promote Compliance and Support Innovators** – The aim is to help innovators navigate the regulatory environment. This involves a conceptual shift for regulators, moving from a "policeman" or "watchdog" role to a "support function" and a "champion for the public," or even for the climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. This requires a change in mindset within public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>.

## Initiatives and Approaches

### Agile Nations Network
The Agile Nations Network is a new intergovernmental network fostering international cooperation on rulemaking and practical activities to promote an [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]]-friendly approach to new emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. Members include Denmark, Canada, UK, UAE, Italy, Singapore, and Japan, with the OECD and World Economic Forum contributing to its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.
*   **Goals** – The network aims for mutual capacity building, sharing lessons learned, and discussing the effectiveness of different approaches to rulemaking on [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. It emphasizes international cooperation to share knowledge, evidence, and avoid unnecessary divergence in rules that could inhibit cross-border [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]] and joint actions on common risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>.
*   **Practical Objectives** – These include sharing foresight and evidence on [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]] opportunities and risks, exploring joint experimentation and regulatory sandboxes, identifying opportunities for interoperable regulation, and supporting startups in navigating international regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>.
*   **Work Program Themes** – The network's initial work program focuses on:
    *   Regulator tools for [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]]-friendly regulations, such as building and executing regulatory sandboxes and principles for [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:09]</a>.
    *   Specific technological areas like mobility, green tech, medical devices, and data, with suggested cooperation areas including consumer-connected products and digital health software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:36:00">[20:36:00]</a>.

### Regulatory Sandboxes
Regulatory sandboxes are a sub-category of experimental lawmaking, designed to promote [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]] by temporarily waiving or modifying national rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>.
*   **EU AI Act Proposal** – The EU AI Act proposal aims to foster [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]] and reduce regulatory burden for SMEs and startups through regulatory sandboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. These sandboxes are envisioned as a controlled environment to facilitate the development, testing, and validation of innovative AI systems within a limited time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>.
*   **Experimental Legal Regime** – This regime, which is not new, encourages actors to test new technologies or services in a real-life environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>. Key characteristics include temporary nature, a trial-and-error approach, and collaborative involvement of stakeholders, innovators, and competent authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:00">[25:41:00]</a>.
    *   **By Delegation** – Rules or regulations are set aside, requiring an "experimental clause" in the legal basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:00">[26:36:00]</a>.
    *   **By Devolution** – National or supranational governments empower local governments to establish specific regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>.
*   **Challenges and Benefits** – While sandboxes aim to be an exception from strict regulation to enable future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>, a key challenge lies in how derogations from existing data protection legislation will be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. Data protection authorities are expected to act as "gatekeepers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:46:00">[29:46:00]</a>. A significant benefit is that sandboxes help supervisory authorities become accustomed to new technologies, fostering learning and upskilling for regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.

### European Commission's Perspective
The European Commission is actively evolving its better regulation system to be more [[resilience_and_agility_in_government | agile]] in an uncertain world of rapid change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48:00">[50:48:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Direction** – This includes a focus on more flexible and [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile]] consultation systems, burden reduction (e.g., "one in, one out" approach), better alignment with current policy agendas (e.g., "do no significant harm," [[digital_transformation_in_governance | digital by default]]), and stronger integration of strategic foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:58:00">[50:58:00]</a>. Transparency in underpinning evidence and possibilities for engagement are also emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>.
*   **Integrating the Digital Dimension** – The Commission seeks to integrate the [[digital_transformation_in_governance | digital dimension]] into its work more broadly, covering consultations, impact assessments, and evaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:19:00">[54:19:00]</a>. This includes principles like "once only" and systematically assessing how to support the [[digital_transformation_in_governance | digital transition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:40:00">[54:40:00]</a>.
*   **New Regulatory Techniques** – The Commission is providing stronger profiles for [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | new regulatory techniques]] for [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile regulation]], such as adaptive regulations, co-creation, self-regulatory techniques, and [[goalbased_regulation_in_digital_transformation | outcome-based regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:28:00">[55:28:00]</a>. Regulatory sandboxes, while new to the Commission, are being explored with a mapping exercise to learn from existing examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:21:00">[56:21:00]</a>.
*   **Safeguards and Learning** – While flexibility is enabled, it's crucial not to undermine regulatory standards. Sandboxes must operate in controlled environments, supervised by competent authorities, with fairness in the system. The goal is to facilitate learning and [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]] from those with expertise, while ensuring safeguards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:58:00">[56:58:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Data Science and AI** – The Commission is investing in data science and AI for internal work, such as exploiting large volumes of consultation contributions and engaging with citizens through multilingual platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:51:00">[58:51:00]</a>.

## Industry Perspective and [[challenges_of_implementing_agile_governance | Challenges]]
From an industry perspective, especially for tech companies, [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile regulation]] is crucial, but certain [[challenges_of_implementing_agile_governance | challenges]] and desires persist:
*   **Accountability** – Businesses are highly accountable to shareholders and staff. A call for similar accountability in regulators and policymakers is made, focusing on outcome-driven approaches and transparency to taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>. Governments should operate more like startups, demonstrating results to their "shareholders" (citizens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:21:00">[36:21:00]</a>.
*   **Upskilling and Informed Decision-Making** – There's a significant knowledge gap between regulators/policymakers and technologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>. Deep upskilling in technology is essential for regulators to have meaningful conversations and make informed decisions, preventing stifled [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]] or biases towards large tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:00">[38:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>. Outsourcing this knowledge is insufficient; an entrenched understanding is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:00">[40:19:00]</a>.
*   **Bias Towards Smaller Innovators** – Policy-making sometimes disproportionately benefits large tech companies. There should be a bias towards interviewing and listening to smaller SMEs and new tech startups, whose implementation of technology can be very different from larger players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing Failure and Iteration** – The concept of "minimum viable product" (MVP) and being "brave enough to fail" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:00">[42:27:00]</a>. Unlike sandboxes, which may miss the "butterfly effect" of real-world interconnectivity, MVPs allow for small-scale market releases to observe, learn, and pivot rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:46:00">[42:46:00]</a>. This prevents regulations from becoming outdated due to slow development cycles and encourages an [[agility_and_transformation_in_the_public_sector | agile feedback loop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a>.
*   **Global Interconnectivity** – Technology is inherently interconnected, and a global approach to regulation is more important than ever. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the ability to make global decisions, which should extend to technology regulation to address issues like cybersecurity and protect citizens effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:08:00">[46:08:00]</a>. Regulatory competition among countries can be a difficult balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>, but government agencies often share a strong desire to collaborate and learn about regulating new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>.

## Moving Forward
*   **Overcoming Risk Aversion** – Public administration is often risk-averse, but [[embracing_uncertainty_in_governance | embracing uncertainty]] and accepting that mistakes are part of a learning experience is a true [[challenges_of_implementing_agile_governance | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>. Incentives should empower and encourage administrative entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>.
*   **Regulation as "Do No Harm"** – Instead of regulating every specific [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]], the focus should be on general guidelines or "do no harm" clauses that express core values. This allows for checking if an [[innovations_in_regulatory_systems | innovation]] conflicts with these general guidelines, rather than needing new specific regulation for every technological advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>.
*   **Neutral Platforms for Collaboration** – There's a need for neutral platforms that promote collaboration between large and small companies and regulators, while protecting intellectual property. Such platforms could help smaller innovators engage without fear of losing their IP or insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>. This aims to avoid regulations that, like GDPR, might disproportionately impact smaller companies despite being guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:20">[01:24:20]</a>.
*   **Integrating Foresight** – [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | Strategic foresight]] is crucial for preparing for the future, but it must be integrated with existing regulatory processes and balanced with flexibility, as it won't provide all answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sectoral Cooperation** – New technologies cut across traditional sectors. Strengthening conversations and connections between governmental agencies within and across countries is vital, as technologies often "fall between the cracks" of different regulatory bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>.

The ultimate goal is for all regulation to embody the spirit of [[agile_regulatory_approaches | agile regulation]], eliminating the need for a distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:57">[01:37:57]</a>.

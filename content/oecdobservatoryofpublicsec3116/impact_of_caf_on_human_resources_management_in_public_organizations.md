The Common Assessment Framework (CAF) is a tool designed to assess and improve the quality of public sector organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While traditionally focused on quality, there is a strong desire for quality to no longer be separated from [[Innovation in public sector management | public sector innovation]] and better regulation issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. CAF helps organizations become well-prepared for uncertainties and embraces constant learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This holistic approach to performance analysis aims to change the mindset of both the organization and its staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## CAF's Role in Organizational Culture and Employee Mindset

Research indicates that both quality practices and [[Innovation in public sector management | innovation]] are essential and interconnected processes; they should not be treated separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. CAF provides a platform that helps organizations to improve and be ready to innovate, setting a different type of thinking among staff by using their knowledge and embracing change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Eva Seletum of the Vienna City Administration highlights that CAF acts as a coach towards organizational development and the development of a new culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This new culture emphasizes that everyone makes a difference, and activities combined with abilities and motivation are needed for continuous improvement and [[Innovation in public sector management | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. While cultural change cannot be simply ordered, the use of CAF starts with basic steps of organizational improvement, eventually leading to a new mindset which is a major effect of CAF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

Resilient and [[Innovation in public sector management | innovative]] organizations exhibit five key characteristics, all of which are embedded within the CAF model and its principles of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>:
*   **Preparedness**: Having clear short and long-term priorities and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Adaptability**: Utilizing an adaptable workforce with flexible teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Collaboration**: Increasing collaboration both inside and outside the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Trustworthiness**: Building trust between leaders and employees, and fostering transparency internally and externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Responsibility**: Adapting in response to crises, going beyond the bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Evidence from Poll Results and Slovenian Study

A poll conducted during the session revealed that participants perceive human resource management to be the area most affected by the use of CAF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>.

> The poll indicated that human resource management issues and fields are the most affected by the use of CAF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.

This perception is supported by a study conducted in Slovenia on the impact of CAF implementation on human resource management and the "people" criteria, which measured a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. Gracia Bara Arivas commented that this study helps pinpoint key elements for improvement and highlights how CAF can guide organizations step-by-step in managing human resources differently from the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:34">[01:12:34]</a>.

## Detailed Insights from Employee Surveys: Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and Sport

Xenia Halfman from the Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and Sport presented a project initiated by their ministry to develop a uniform methodology for employee surveys among CAF users in the Slovenian public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>. This initiative stemmed from a CAF improvement plan measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

The questionnaire, named "Employee Eyes," was prepared collaboratively in about two months, drawing on the rich experiences of participating organizations in an open and trustworthy environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>.

Objectives of the "Employee Eyes" survey:
*   Gain insight into how the organization works as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.
*   Obtain important information for strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>.
*   Develop a uniform methodology for comparison among organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   Prepare a customizable questionnaire for each organization's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>.
*   Identify benefits and opportunities for improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

The questionnaire is modular, including sections on organizational climate, employee satisfaction, perception of change, energy vitality, and total motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. A key principle for questions was that they must be actionable and have value-added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Survey Announcement, Application, Analysis, and Interpretation**: Efforts to raise response rates through introductory addresses and reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>.
2.  **Survey Result Dissemination**: Results must be prepared for individual target populations, especially management, and provided to every employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.
3.  **Survey Result Implementation**: This is the most crucial phase, requiring action on results, building a realistic action plan, and introducing changes in the work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>.
4.  **Questionnaire Reapplication**: Essential to finish the cycle and assess the success of the implementation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>.

Initial results from the survey in the Slovenian Ministry showed that while there were minimal differences in employees' desire to gain knowledge and skills, significant differences existed in their ability to participate in training referrals and the availability of appropriate training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. Similarly, most employees understood their working goals, but opinions differed on whether department heads planned work efficiently or distributed tasks impartially among co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>.

These insights demonstrate that when survey results are properly utilized, they become a powerful management tool for strategic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>.

## Lessons from [[Impact of COVID19 on public sector management | COVID-19]] and Future HR Management

The [[Impact of COVID 19 on government operations | COVID-19]] crisis highlighted the need for public administrations to focus on complex, multi-dimensional issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>. Key lessons for strengthening resilience include:
*   **Agility**: Ability to move rapidly, including to large-scale remote working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.
*   **Skills and Capabilities**: Cultivating these among public sector employees to solve complex problems and [[Innovation in public sector management | innovate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.
*   **HR Policies and Strategies**: Adapting these to new working environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

The CAF model can help assess public organizations' preparedness for crises and make them more resilient across various dimensions, including adapting managerial structures and coordinating to address complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. The shift to remote and hybrid work models, intensified by the pandemic, has significantly impacted [[Future of public employment | working methods]] and areas like knowledge management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>. The latest CAF 2020 model explicitly includes "continued learning, [[Innovation in public sector management | innovation]], and improvement" as one of its principles of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>, and manages change and innovation in an agile way under its strategy and planning criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>, directly influencing HR practices.

The ongoing study by the OECD and the European Commission, with the support of the European Institute of Public Administration (EIPA), aims to analyze what happened with organizations using CAF during the pandemic to draw lessons for strengthening resilience and future HR management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, including how the CAF model might evolve as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>.

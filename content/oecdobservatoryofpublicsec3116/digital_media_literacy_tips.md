Digital media literacy tips are a key component of behavioral interventions designed to combat the spread of miss and disinformation by empowering individuals to make informed choices about the information they consume and share online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The global challenge of misinformation is heavily influenced by individual behaviors, as the spread of inaccurate information ultimately relies on personal choices in how people consume and share content with their networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Purpose and Application
A failure to apply a behavioral lens poses a significant risk to the success of any solutions aimed at tackling misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Digital media literacy tips aim to address this by:
*   Helping to better understand the complexities of why people share misinformation on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   Influencing how individuals navigate information ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   Counteracting the "inattention to accuracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a> that can lead to the sharing of false news, even when individuals do not believe it to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   Guiding the design and delivery of more effective policies, programs, and communications against misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Experimental Testing and Results
In a collaborative study between the OECD, the Canadian Privy Council Office's Impact Innovation Unit, and the French Behavioral Insights Unit, two scalable interventions were tested to boost attention before people engage with news online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>:

1.  **Accuracy Evaluation**: Participants were asked to rate the accuracy of a random news headline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
2.  **Digital Media Literacy Tips**: Participants were shown a brief list of media literacy tips, such as "investigate the source," "look at other reports," and "watch for unusual formatting," before seeing both true and false news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

The experiment involved nearly 2,000 Canadians, quota-matched to national demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Participants viewed 14 headlines (seven true, seven false) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Outcomes measured included belief in true vs. false news and likelihood of sharing news on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

### Key Findings
*   People were more likely to rate true news as accurate and had higher intentions to share true headlines compared to fake news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   A "disconnect between sharing intentions and knowledge of what is true and false" was observed, meaning some individuals might share fake news even if they don't believe it's true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   Both interventions were effective, but the **digital media literacy tips** had the greatest impact, reducing intentions to share fake news by 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   The effectiveness of the interventions was found to be similar across different population clusters, including "non-trusting," "high trusting," and "institution trusting" groups, suggesting the tips are "globally useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>. This aligns with academic literature suggesting these types of interventions show similar effects regardless of demographic or political factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.
*   The tips were most effective on information rated as most inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>.

## Policy Implications
The study provides key policy messages for tackling [[Interventions and strategies to reduce misinformation | misinformation]]:
*   **Don't ignore the human factor**: A comprehensive policy response to miss and disinformation must include an expanded understanding of human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
*   **Empower people**: Empowering users through methods like digital media literacy tips offers effective and scalable solutions that can complement holistic policy strategies and offset the threat of fake news without regulating content directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.
*   **Find what works across borders**: Governments should conduct rigorous policy experiments collaboratively with other countries to generate sustainable responses to the spread of misinformation, as "fake news knows no borders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Broader Context and Future Directions
This work highlights the [[Importance of digital literacy | importance of digital literacy]] and the need for a "whole of society approach" to address miss and disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The findings align with existing efforts, such as the US health misinformation toolkit developed by OES, which provides information and exercises to help people recognize false health information and talk to those who spread it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Future research should focus on understanding whether these interventions are equally effective across different types of misinformation (e.g., scientific, political, [[Cultural change and medias role in shaping democracy | cultural]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. Continued cross-border collaboration and replication of studies in diverse contexts are crucial for building richer data and generating widely applicable solutions to address the [[Challenges in addressing misinformation in different contexts | challenges in addressing misinformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

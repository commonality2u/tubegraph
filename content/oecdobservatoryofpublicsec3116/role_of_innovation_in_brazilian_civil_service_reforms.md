The [[overview_of_oecd_reports_on_public_sector_innovation_in_brazil | OECD reports on public sector innovation in Brazil]] highlight the critical need for and existing efforts in [[innovation in the public sector | innovation in the public sector]] to drive essential civil service reforms. These reforms are crucial for Brazil to meet its ambitions and address complex societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## Historical Context and Drivers for Innovation
Brazil has a long history of reform efforts, with consistent emphasis on de-bureaucratization since the 1990s, including focuses on new public management, modernization, and, more recently, digital transformation and innovation needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Despite this, [[innovation in public administration | innovation in public administration]] has often been sporadic and reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Key drivers for a more considered approach to [[innovation in public sector | innovation in public sector]] include:
*   Addressing inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   Improving the financial position of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   Fighting corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   Dealing with changing demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

While [[innovation in the public sector | innovation in the public sector]] is not a "magic bullet," it is a necessary component for tackling these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Challenges to Systemic Innovation
The Brazilian public service system is characterized by a legalistic approach and a strong emphasis on controls and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This often leads to risk aversion, a common characteristic in public sectors, where the focus is on avoiding negative feedback rather than celebrating successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This inherent bias against [[innovation in public sector | innovation in public sector]] means that even presidential decrees mandating innovation are insufficient on their own to embed a practice of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## Two Key OECD Reports
Two recent OECD reports, conducted in partnership with ENAP (National School for Public Administration), provide an [[overview_of_oecd_reports_on_public_sector_innovation_in_brazil | overview of OECD reports on public sector innovation in Brazil]]:
1.  **Public Sector Innovation System in Brazil**: Focuses on how Brazil can adopt a more deliberate and systemic approach to [[innovation in public administration | innovation in public administration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
2.  **Innovation Skills and Leadership in Brazilian Public Sector**: Addresses the competencies and leadership needed among civil servants to drive and support innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

These reports were started under one administration and concluded under a different one, demonstrating that an external vision from the OECD helped provide continuity to these agendas during political transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## A Deliberate and Systemic Approach to Innovation
For [[innovation in public sector | innovation in public sector]] to be truly effective, it must move beyond sporadic, individual efforts and become a deliberate, systemic activity within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This approach involves:
*   **Extent Needed**: Ensuring [[innovation in public services | innovation in public services]] is occurring to the necessary degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.
*   **Right Mix**: Achieving the appropriate balance of different types of innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
*   **Stewardship**: Having some form of collective oversight to ensure the innovation system is delivering as hoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

Much of the current innovative activity in Brazil is driven by individuals or organizational perspectives, rather than systemic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. The system's structure tends to push innovation towards incremental and uncontroversial changes, despite a need for more radical exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

### Determinants and Facets of Innovation
The OECD's determinants model considers innovation driven by individuals, single organizations, or as a systemic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. When innovation is primarily individual-driven, it is not sustainable and vulnerable to individuals leaving or burning out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. The goal is to move innovation up to the organizational and systemic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

The innovation facets model describes different types of innovation:
*   **Enhancement-oriented**: Building on existing approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented**: Addressing big, audacious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
*   **Adaptive**: Responding to changes on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.
*   [[role_of_civil_servants_in_anticipatory_innovation | Anticipatory]]: Questioning current practices given a changing future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

In Brazil's risk-conscious environment, innovation is often pushed towards the enhancement-oriented space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

## The Role of Leadership and Skills for Innovation
The second report focuses on how leaders and civil servants can support and drive [[innovation in public administration | innovation in public administration]]. The public sector's significant investment in civil servants' salaries (nearly 30% of government spending in Brazil) necessitates effective management and leadership to ensure they are supported and directed to use their talents for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.

A skilled and professional senior civil service also contributes to greater integrity and public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. Leadership support is crucial for successful [[innovation in public sector | innovation in public sector]] and its absence is a major barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>.

### Innovation Skills and Leadership Model
The report identifies six core skill areas for [[innovation in public sector | public sector innovation]]:
1.  **Individual self-assessment**: Brazilian civil servants have a moderate assessment of their own skills, with high curiosity but less confidence in areas like iteration or user-centricity (e.g., prototyping, behavioral insights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.
2.  **Managerial support**: Perceptions of management's ability to support these skills are significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.
3.  **Organizational readiness**: Organizations' readiness to put these skills into action falls between individual and managerial assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.

Leaders for innovation need to ensure their workforce has the right skills and can activate them. The ideal public sector leader, as envisioned by Brazilian public sector innovators, embodies:
*   **Business Skills**: Aligning resources with needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.
*   **Innovation Skills**: Understanding how to support and lead iterative processes, data science, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
*   **Mindsets**: Including empathy, empowerment, continuous learning, courage, and digital fluency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.

### Building a Senior Civil Service System
Most OECD countries have structured processes for defining, developing, selecting, and reinforcing leadership. This is framed as a supply and demand model:
*   **Supply Side**:
    *   Clearly defining skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>.
    *   Providing development opportunities for current and future leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
    *   Mapping the workforce to identify existing skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.
    *   Creating a learning culture for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.
*   **Demand Side**:
    *   Appointing leaders based on clear, innovation-related criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.
    *   Providing ongoing support through training, performance, and accountability mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

In Brazil, there is significant effort on the supply side (e.g., innovation training), but much less on the demand side, largely due to political appointment processes that historically lacked clear criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. Recent presidential decrees establishing minimum criteria for leadership positions are a positive starting point, but a genuine senior civil service system requires further development and embedding in legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.

Innovation needs to be integrated into job profiles and performance assessments for senior civil servants. This provides clarity on responsibilities and offers protection against personal risk when undertaking novel approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.

## Areas of Opportunity for Reform
The reports suggest several opportunities to advance [[innovation in public administration | public sector innovation]] and civil service reforms:
*   **Whole System**:
    *   Establish an explicit agenda for [[innovation in public sector | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.
    *   Address structural drivers that lean against innovation (e.g., audit functions focusing on risks of *not* innovating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
    *   Assign explicit responsibility for stewardship of the public sector innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.
*   **Central Actors**:
    *   Major agencies should have an explicit role in system functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
    *   The Ministry of Economy should clarify links between [[innovation in public sector | public sector innovation]] and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
    *   Control bodies (e.g., TCU) should consider how audit and risk management can *support* innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.
    *   ENAP, on behalf of the InnovaGov Network, could partner with actors to develop an annual commentary on the system's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
*   **Individual Agencies**:
    *   Publicize innovation priorities within their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>.

## Wider Engagement for Innovation
### [[open_innovation_and_its_application_in_the_brazilian_public_sector | Open Innovation and its Application in the Brazilian Public Sector]]
[[open_innovation_and_its_application_in_the_brazilian_public_sector | Open innovation]] is a valuable tool, recognizing that solutions can come from outside government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>. While effective for defined aims, its value varies depending on the type of innovation (e.g., less for exploratory or [[role_of_civil_servants_in_anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>. Brazil is experimenting with challenge platforms (e.g., DESAFIO Gov.BR) where public sector organizations suggest challenges and offer awards for solutions, promoting engagement with external partners like startups and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>.

### Role of Universities
Universities play a crucial role by:
*   Creating the pipeline of future public servants and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>.
*   Developing stronger linkages with government to clarify opportunities in public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.
*   Providing insights for identifying problems, generating solutions (technology, policy, practices), and offering rigor for evaluating implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.
*   Promoting a stronger connection between government, universities, and the private sector to develop innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>.
*   Assisting in piloting public policies and promoting faster, more efficient implementation and appraisal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.

The [[challenges_and_opportunities_for_public_sector_innovation_in_brazil | challenges and opportunities for public sector innovation in Brazil]] are significant, but ongoing discussions and initiatives, such as those driven by ENAP and other government entities, demonstrate a commitment to fostering a more mature, consistent, and deliberate approach to [[innovation in public sector | public sector innovation]] as a core element of civil service reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>.

Green public governance aims to address environmental threats, with human behavior recognized as a core target for governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Sustainability has been a top policy area for behavioral scientists over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Current State and Achievements

Behavioral science has yielded successful examples in influencing climate-related behaviors, such as:
*   **Feedback Interventions**: Reducing energy consumption through feedback, like Opower's method of comparing individual energy use to neighbors' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This often results in 2-6% energy reductions when individuals are using more energy than their neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Opower's approach has evolved to include sophisticated benchmarks, comparing users to "people like you" (e.g., similar family size, climate, house type) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **Product Labeling**: Encouraging sustainable spending through better labeling of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Home Power Savings Programs**: In New South Wales, Australia, a program targeting low-income households initially saw savings mainly from installed energy-efficient kits (e.g., low-energy light globes, low-flow showerheads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Behavioral science training for assessors, focusing on tools like commitment devices, limited choice, and social norms, increased energy efficiency by an additional 4-5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. This included simplifying complex options (e.g., reducing six pages of choices to four or five) and using public commitment devices (e.g., writing choices on the fridge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   **Information Clarity**: Using controlled experiments to improve comprehension and processing of information, such as different ways of presenting time-of-use electricity tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Counter-intuitively, a simple table performed better than a clock visual for understanding tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

## Challenges in Green Governance

Despite successes, significant [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges faced by governments]] remain:
*   **Late Integration of Behavioral Science**: Behavioral science has primarily been used to improve policies already implemented, rather than informing early policy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Scaling Issues**: Successful behavioral interventions often face difficulty scaling up from a sample to a wider population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
*   **Limited Impact of Single Nudges**: Simple "quick win" nudge interventions, like sending behaviorally informed letters, may increase interest (e.g., inquiries about heat pumps) but often do not translate to actual behavior change (e.g., installations) if other barriers remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Awareness alone is not enough for behavioral change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
*   **Ineffective Incentives**: While incentives exist (e.g., paying less for less energy), people are not always rational, and incentives may need to be significantly higher to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. Subsidies, even as high as 80-90% with interest-free loans, may not overcome aversion to any form of debt for low-income households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   **Low Engagement with Data**: Universal rollout of digital energy meters, assuming people would access their data and become "energy zealots," has largely failed, with very few accessing data and even fewer sustaining engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.
*   **Political Polarization**: Policies like carbon taxes can become politicized, leading to their withdrawal despite potential benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.
*   **Organizational "Sludge"**: Significant bureaucratic and regulatory "sludge" (friction costs) can hinder the adoption of green technologies and strategies by both households and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. For example, in the UK, a Â£5000 grant for heat pumps is hampered by a lack of trained plumbers and long waiting times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.
*   **Ethical Concerns with Segmentation and RCTs**: Segmenting customers to target interventions (e.g., high-emission households, those most likely to switch) or running Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) where some receive benefits and others don't, raises ethical and public relations concerns regarding fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
*   **Crowding Out**: A danger exists that governments might rely too heavily on "soft" behavioral insights, potentially crowding out the implementation of "harder" but sometimes more effective policies like strong regulation or financial incentives/disincentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>.

## Opportunities for Behavioral Science in Green Governance

Behavioral science offers promising pathways to support a greener [[Challenges and Future Prospects in European Governance | future]]:

### Informing Policy Development
*   **Earlier Integration**: Behavioral science should be used earlier in the policy process, influencing the design of environmental policies, new taxes, regulations, and stakeholder consultations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This includes moving from "systemic behavioral solutions" to fostering "systemic change" that empowers public governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Diagnostics**: Utilizing behavioral science as a diagnostic tool to understand *why* people *don't* change their behavior, thereby identifying systemic drivers or structures that prevent desired actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. This helps governments identify which other tools might be needed beyond typical incentives or persuasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Agenda Setting**: Proactively using behavioral insights in the policy agenda-setting stage to determine what goals should be pursued, not just how to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

### Garnering Policy Support and Acceptability
*   **Softening the Audience**: Behavioral science can be used to prepare and encourage public support for policies *ahead of time* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Spillover**: Encouraging initial pro-environmental behaviors can lead to support for broader policies (e.g., people performing pro-environmental actions are more likely to support wind power policy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Influencing Identity**: Fostering a community's self-perception (identity) as "good at saving energy" or "good at acting for nature" can increase the likelihood of supporting subsequent green policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Communication**: Be transparent about policy goals and how they contribute to long-term objectives to prevent public resistance or feeling manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

### New Tools and Systemic Changes
*   **Multi-pronged Interventions**: For complex issues like adopting new technologies, combining multiple behavioral insights (e.g., incentives, exclusivity, social norms) with concrete, non-behavioral interventions (e.g., removing financial barriers, involving contractors) is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. Examples include "solarize programs" that facilitate community group buying for solar panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
*   **Digital Nudges with Immediate Feedback**: Using digital nudges to provide immediate, personalized feedback on actions, which is highly effective for learning and behavioral improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.
*   **"Nudge Plus" and Co-design**: Moving beyond simple nudging to a more general [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | approach to behavioral thinking]] that involves systematically including target groups (e.g., citizens, communities) in the design and even testing of interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. This human-centered approach ensures policies address real problems and barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.
*   **Smarter Financial Tools**: Designing financial disincentives like carbon taxes in "smarter" ways, such as providing a "climate bonus" at the beginning of the year, framed clearly as being linked to climate goals, and aimed at preventing energy poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Organizational Behavior**: Individual models of behavior can effectively explain and predict organizational behavior, suggesting that organizations respond to incentives, social pressure (e.g., rivals adopting green policies), and consumer demand for greener products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.
*   **Sludge Assessments**: Actively conducting "sludge assessments" to identify and eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic barriers and friction costs that impede desired behaviors in both private and corporate contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.
*   **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Learning from other disciplines like human-centered design and architecture (beyond choice architecture) to build spaces and systems that facilitate desired behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.
*   **Citizen Juries and Panels**: Utilizing tools like citizen juries and panels to adjudicate complex policy questions and generate solutions with public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.
*   **Green Defaults**: Implementing green defaults across all policies, including procurement and schools. This is a powerful tool for large-scale behavioral change because people learn by doing, and defaults provide a quicker path to action and subsequent value change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.
*   **Strategic Prioritization**: Prioritizing a few key behaviors that have a large impact and are relatively easy to change, then rallying all relevant stakeholders (e.g., businesses, supply chains, government) around promoting that single behavior. An example is the city of Townsville's campaign to encourage painting roofs white, which significantly reduced indoor temperatures and energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>.

## Call to Action for Policymakers

To effectively leverage behavioral science for green governance, policymakers should:
*   **Embed Behavioral Insights**: Make the use of behavioral insights a standard, integral step in the policy process, much like conducting a cost-benefit analysis, rather than an ad-hoc "nice to have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. This means understanding the key behavioral assumptions behind different policy approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.
*   **Implement Green Defaults**: Proactively establish green defaults in all relevant policies and systems, from procurement to public services, to facilitate quicker and wider adoption of sustainable behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.
*   **Ensure Good Governance**: Be transparent, avoid "bad nudges" (dark patterns), and ensure that behavioral approaches complement, rather than replace, necessary "harder" regulations, laws, and financial commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. It's crucial for governments to adhere to their own climate commitments to maintain public trust and motivate individual action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.
*   **Prioritize and Collaborate**: Focus efforts on high-impact, achievable behaviors and foster cross-sector collaboration to align efforts around these key changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>.

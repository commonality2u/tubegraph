This article explores the concept and practice of stewarding innovation portfolios, particularly within the public sector and multi-stakeholder environments, drawing insights from the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and case studies from Sweden.

## Introduction to Innovation Portfolios and Stewardship
The pace of change is increasing, and problems are diversifying, meaning there is no single, one-size-fits-all approach to public sector innovation. Governments are increasingly expected to handle unforeseen challenges, making the topic of innovation portfolios core to the practice of public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. While it is an emerging practice, there is not yet a rigorous or standard approach to [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | innovation portfolio management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The key is to be intentional in managing these portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## OECD's Innovation Facets Model
The OPSI has developed an Innovation Facets Model for [[Innovation Portfolios and Management | portfolio management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This framework, developed from work with system-level governments (national, regional, and sub-national), describes the broad purposes of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It is one of many frameworks available, but its use is for clarification, sense-making, and orienting future action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

The model differentiates between four types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>:
*   **Mission-oriented innovation** - Addresses overall challenges and societal goals, orienting action in a top-down and directed way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation** - Focuses on taking existing practices and making them better, more efficient, and more widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation** - Looks at new, expressed needs that require addressing, creating spaces for bottom-up exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation** - Involves looking at extreme uncertainty and shaping changes based on potential future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Application of the Model
The Innovation Facets Model has been applied in various contexts to frame important conversations and seed action around portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>:
*   **Sweden (Vinnova)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
*   **Asia-Pacific National Statistics Offices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
*   **Montenegro** - Focusing on the innovation portfolio's response to crises or shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Norway** - Examining the relationship between projects and support structures for different types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Gipuzkoa, Spain** - Specifically looking at different types of experimentation spaces and supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

This portfolio reflection process clarifies what exists and for what purpose, helping to identify relationships between multiple activities and purposes, and potential future directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The first step is clarification, which often reveals why a system is structured in a particular way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. However, the subsequent step of transitioning the portfolio and assessing its outcomes is less explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## [[innovation_portfolio_management_and_its_challenges | Challenges and Strategies for Effective Innovation Portfolio Management]]
OPSI's research into [[innovation_portfolio_management_and_its_challenges | challenges and strategies for effective innovation portfolio management]] explores several key questions:
*   **What led to the current portfolio?** - Understanding the policy context, organizational environment, goals, and priorities that shaped the current portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Who is stewarding a portfolio?** - Often, the stewardship role, whether explicit or implicit, is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Are there strategies and policies supporting each facet?** - Many organizations are strong in only one or two facets, lacking explicit support structures for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Is the current balance indicative of a temporary or long-term trend?** - Portfolios can reflect capabilities or temporary external influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Is the balance supportive of the overall organizational remit or public purpose?** - Organizations may find their current portfolio at odds with stated objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **What roles do different ecosystem actors play in shaping the portfolio?** - While initial understanding often focuses internally, external influences and partners significantly impact the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Innovation portfolios should be viewed from a wider ecosystem perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **What roles are needed to steward innovation portfolios?** - This applies to teams, organizations, and wider ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Drivers of Portfolio Transitions
Beyond contextual factors, various influences can drive portfolio transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. These include scandals, societal changes, and technology shifts, which can push innovative activity in different directions, whether intentionally managed or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. The key question is whether there is the right mix of options and choices for a given context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

An innovation portfolio always exists, whether intentional or not, representing a mix of activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Questions then arise: are we satisfied with the current mix, and what mix *should* we have? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> The "should" question is loaded, particularly in the public sector, relating to legitimacy and which public values are prioritized, often a political question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

## Stewardship at the System Level
Innovation can pull a system in different directions, potentially threatening its overall coherence, compatibility, and interoperability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. The need for innovation constantly changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. While no single person or group can fully control an innovation system, an overall view of what is happening is crucial, and some form of stewardship is needed at the collective level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>.

### Emerging Practices in Stewardship
Key areas of emerging practice include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>:
*   **Appreciating space and legitimacy for transitioning performance or doing new things** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.
*   **Analysis and decision-making support** - What kind of capacity and support exists for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.
*   **Portfolio-level impact assessment** - How is the overall impact of activities assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a>.
*   **Holistic and differentiated support structures** - Supporting all facets of innovation (mission, enhancement, anticipatory, adaptive) simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:14">[01:20:14]</a>.
*   **Diverse capabilities and integrator/connector roles** - Recognizing the need for varied skills and roles that connect different purposes to prevent fragmentation and keep activities aligned with core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.
*   **Cooperation structures and knowledge-sharing systems** - Essential for ongoing sense-making and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:04]</a>.

A significant aspect is working in multi-stakeholder environments or ecosystems where no single entity has absolute control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>. The challenge is to advance innovation work beyond organizational borders, teams, units, or even the public sector itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.

## Case Studies from Sweden: [[Innovation Portfolio Management in Public Sector | Innovation Portfolio Management in the Public Sector]]

### Viable Cities
Viable Cities is a program with the mission of achieving climate-neutral cities by 2030, with a good life for all within planetary boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. This is a mission-oriented approach, focusing on systems transformation that involves everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. The program has a budget of approximately 100 million euros over 12 years, funded by three Swedish government agencies: Vinnova, the Swedish Energy Agency, and Formas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. It has 100 member organizations representing a "quadruple helix": companies, public organizations, academia/research institutes, and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

The main purpose of a portfolio strategy for Viable Cities is to align climate transition and sustainability efforts to contribute more impactfully to their mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. This addresses fragmentation, projectification, and the missing directionality and reflexivity in current efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

#### Key Efforts and Learnings:
*   **Climate Neutral Cities 2030**: A flagship effort initiated in 2019, where initially nine, and soon 20, Swedish cities and their partners pioneer efforts to accelerate climate transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **Climate City Contract**: A core part of Viable Cities' approach, this document assigns commitments to national-level government agencies and cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. It's a negotiated collaboration for faster climate transition, revised and signed yearly, stewarding ownership and commitments to the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.
*   **Transition Lab**: A mechanism for accelerating learning for climate transition, helping municipalities and stakeholders clarify common direction, leverage synergies, renew decision-making processes, and build dynamic capabilities for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Portfolio of Portfolios**: The concept emerges that a mission-oriented portfolio needs to align and connect efforts through learning mechanisms of different actors and governance levels, essentially becoming a "portfolio of portfolios" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. Open interfaces between portfolios are explored to facilitate connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.
*   **Centrality of City-Level Portfolios**: Due to the mission, city-level portfolios are central, though the specific central level may depend on the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Cross-Portfolio Examples**:
    *   **Drive Sweden**: Aligning efforts with another strategic [[innovation_strategies | innovation program]] focused on mobility, committed to climate neutrality in cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.
    *   **Climate Smart Cities Challenge**: An international initiative organized with UN-Habitat to connect cities across geographical borders and learn from new portfolio strategies (e.g., defining challenges, designing system demonstrators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.
*   **Sense-making Process**: It's crucial to have a critical sense-making process for this emerging practice to understand what a "transformative portfolio" could be in a new collaborative context, moving beyond preconceptions of just projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. It asks "portfolio of what?" – including challenges, needs, and barriers, not just innovations or projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.

#### Role and Tools
Viable Cities sees its role as a "mission driver," connecting governmental agencies, municipalities, and others, relating their portfolios to needs, challenges, and insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. This involves coordinating, inspiring, creating collaboration opportunities, doing analysis, and pushing initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>. A high emphasis is placed on cities and citizens from a needs-driven perspective, with municipalities as facilitators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. The Climate City Contract is a central tool, allowing the program to influence upcoming grant calls based on city needs and dialogues with stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>. Open calls are used to find interested international partners, and collaborations with organizations like UN-Habitat and Swedish embassies help leverage existing bilateral relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:01">[01:37:01]</a>.

#### Evaluation Challenges
Evaluating impact for transformative change and mission-oriented approaches is difficult using standard models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:16">[01:42:16]</a>. It's not just about cutting CO2 emissions, but also about building the muscle for transformative change, empowering collective learning capacity, and driving systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>. The Climate City Contract includes a strand on how to learn to evaluate in an appropriate way for a mission-oriented approach, focusing on systematic collaboration and mobilization of actors rather than just specific endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>.

### Future by Lund
Future by Lund is an innovation platform at the municipality of Lund, Sweden, acting as an experiment in [[portfolio exploration for public sector innovation | portfolio stewardship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. It connects companies, organizations, city departments, universities, and research institutes, operating in a multi-stakeholder environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. The core understanding is that fragmentation exists, no one dictates over another, and trust, negotiation, and timing are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. The platform helps tackle challenges and possibilities that extend beyond a single city's scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.

#### Working Principles and Benefits
*   **Zone Model**: Used to frame activities: a "yellow zone" for uncertainty and risk, where concepts and projects are created, leading to a "green zone" for implementation and upscaling when activities become core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>.
*   **Collective Impact**: The platform has involved 120 organizations, undertaken many projects, and generated significant external investment, with sustainability and climate as core themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Portfolio Approach**:
    *   **Common Vocabulary**: Establishes shared understanding and frame of reference for what a "portfolio" means for the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.
    *   **Visualization Tool**: Helps identify strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in activities (e.g., sufficient exploratory work) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.
    *   **Strategic Discussion Basis**: Enables collective strategic discussions on where to invest resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.
    *   **Tracking Movement**: Provides snapshots over time to observe how activities progress across the portfolio (e.g., using the Innovation Facets Model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>.
    *   **Connecting Activities to Assets**: Links projects and functions to the innovation ecosystem's assets, supporting matching ideas with resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>.

#### Governance and Practice
Future by Lund is developing a governance framework built on three sub-models: mapping innovation assets (following the Global Institute for Innovation Districts model), the Innovation Facets Model, and annual snapshots for tracking portfolio dynamism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>. The team uses these models to map their own involvement and facilitate discussions with partners, identifying connections and gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>. The goal is to move activities from exploration towards implementation and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>. This often involves "impact by proxy," where Future by Lund creates the environment for others (companies, city departments) to take over and implement solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.

The daily work involves building relationships, understanding needs, and constantly asking "what do you need?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a> This can lead to matching partners, initiating pre-studies, or providing other support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. Future by Lund's neutrality as an organization is crucial for its credibility, allowing it to move in the gaps between businesses, the city, and the university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>. The team acts as "idea trackers," capturing potential and determining how to move ideas forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>. Building social capital and a common value system are also key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>.

#### Evidencing Impact
Evidencing impact and tracking system transformation is a complex challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>. Future by Lund is inspired by Vinnova's "Layer Model," which tracks leverage effects of investments:
*   **Layer 1**: Base investment (e.g., from Vinnova and municipality).
*   **Layer 2**: Projects where the innovation platform or municipal departments are actors.
*   **Layer 3**: Projects initiated by other ecosystem partners.
*   **Layer 4**: Storytelling process tracing critical multi-stakeholder events that have changed the system, representing steps towards the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>.

Project investments serve as a proxy for the gathering force around a theme, and important events provide qualitative snapshots of progress and increased complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. This approach visualizes the scale-up effect of initial exploratory activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. Evaluation here is seen more as "developmental evaluation" or "formative evaluation" – informing the strategic change process rather than a final judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:20">[01:46:20]</a>. It's about agreeing on indicators of success and continuously checking progress to decide whether to adjust tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:55">[01:46:55]</a>.

For political communication and legitimacy, especially with long-term goals, higher-level policies (EU or national) are crucial to provide a mandate and stability against fluctuating local political priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:33">[01:49:33]</a>. The Innovation Facets Model helps create a common language to explain the value of different types of activities and how they fit together, legitimizing risky, exploratory work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:32">[01:53:32]</a>.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
The work of stewarding innovation portfolios is an ongoing area of research for the OPSI. Tools such as the Innovation Portfolio Exploration Workshop, a self-service portfolio exploration tool, and a tool guide are available online for sense-making, testing transitions, and facilitating discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:40">[01:57:40]</a>. Further discussions on unanswered questions and lessons learned will be held in a community of practice meet-up, with a report on these cases and others to be published later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>.

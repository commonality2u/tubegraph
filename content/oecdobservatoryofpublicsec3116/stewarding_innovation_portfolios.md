Stewarding [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolios]] is an emerging practice that governments are increasingly focusing on to address the accelerating pace of change and diversifying problems they face [00:02:54]. The complexity of modern challenges means there is no "one-size-fits-all" approach to public sector innovation [00:03:06]. The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) is actively researching and exploring this practice to identify patterns and effective examples [00:03:38].

The core idea behind working with [[managing_innovation_portfolios | innovation portfolios]] is to be intentional in managing diverse innovative activities [00:05:02]. This helps with clarification, sense-making, and orienting future action [00:05:06]. A significant challenge involves stewarding these portfolios in [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | multi-stakeholder environments]] or innovation ecosystems [00:05:20].

## OECD Innovation Facets Model

OPSI utilizes an **Innovation Facets Model** to differentiate the purposes of innovation, primarily developed from work with national, regional, and sub-national governments [00:04:00]. While not the only framework, it serves as a tool for portfolio analysis and management [00:04:28]. The model describes four main facets:

*   **Mission-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>: Focuses on overall challenges and societal goals, directing action from a top-down approach [00:06:06].
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>: Aims to improve existing practices, making them more efficient and widespread [00:06:18].
*   **Adaptive innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>: Addresses new or expressed needs from the bottom up, creating spaces for exploration [00:06:28].
*   **Anticipatory innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>: Involves looking at extreme uncertainty and shaping changes based on potential future events [00:06:45].

This framework has been applied in various contexts, including Sweden (Vinnova), Asian Pacific National Statistics Offices, Montenegro (for crisis response), Norway (relationship between projects and support structures), and Gipuzkoa, Spain (experimentation spaces and supports) [00:07:23].

## Portfolio Reflection and Research Questions

The **portfolio reflection process** is the first step, clarifying what exists and for what purpose, helping to understand relationships between activities and purposes, and informing future directions [00:08:26]. While much work has focused on this clarification, the subsequent challenge is transitioning the portfolio and understanding its outcomes [00:09:14].

Current research questions guiding the OECD's work on [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolios]] include:

*   What led to the current portfolio, considering policy context, organizational environment, and goals? [00:10:21]
*   Who is stewarding the portfolio (explicit roles, implicit teams, or individuals)? [00:11:03]
*   Are there strategies and policies supporting each innovation facet, and what are they? [00:11:21] Many organizations tend to be strong in only one or two facets [00:11:29].
*   Is the current balance of the [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolio]] indicative of a temporary or long-term trend? [00:12:08]
*   Is the portfolio's balance supportive of the overall organizational remit or public purpose? [00:12:37] Organizations may find their portfolio at odds with stated objectives [00:12:55].
*   What roles do different [[innovation_ecosystems_and_portfolio_management | ecosystem actors]] play in shaping the portfolio? [00:13:07] Portfolios should be viewed from a wider ecosystem perspective [00:13:47].
*   What roles are needed to steward [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolios]] within teams, organizations, or wider ecosystems? [00:13:51]

## Driving Portfolio Transitions

Portfolio transitions can be driven by various factors, including scandals, societal changes, and technology shifts [00:15:04]. The key question is whether an organization has the right mix of options and choices for its context [00:15:25]. This involves understanding the forces, structures, processes, aptitudes, preferences, and circumstances that push innovative activity in different directions [00:15:35]. There is always some form of [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolio]], whether intentional or not [00:16:04]. The challenge is to intentionally manage it and ensure the mix of activities is desirable [00:16:17].

The question of "what mix should we have?" is loaded, especially in the public sector, as it relates to legitimacy and which public values are prioritized â€“ often a political question [01:16:27].

### Stewardship at the System Level

Innovation can pull a system in different directions, potentially threatening its coherence, compatibility, and interoperability [01:17:26]. The need for innovation continuously changes, and the goal is to proactively guide these shifts [01:17:42]. No single person or group can completely control an [[innovation_ecosystems_and_portfolio_management | innovation system]], but an overall view and some form of stewardship at the collective level are crucial [01:17:56].

## Emerging Practices and Key Areas of Focus

Effective [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolio]] stewardship involves:

*   **Appreciating space for transitioning or doing new things** before starting the work [01:18:50].
*   **Understanding who holds the "cards"** once insights are gathered [01:19:26].
*   **Capacity for analysis and decision-making support** [01:19:54].
*   **Portfolio-level assessment of impact** [01:20:05].
*   **Holistic and differentiated support structures** based on different innovation purposes (e.g., supporting all facets of the Innovation Facets Model simultaneously) [01:20:14].
*   **Diverse capabilities and integrator/connector roles** to manage relationships between diverse activities and prevent fragmentation, ensuring alignment with core business or community work [01:20:39].
*   **Cooperation structures and knowledge sharing systems** for ongoing sense-making and action [01:21:04].

Many organizations find they are not the sole influencer of their portfolio, especially when aiming for changes beyond their direct borders (team, unit, organization, or even public sector) [01:21:21]. This necessitates advancing work in [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | multi-stakeholder environments]] and ecosystems [01:22:01].

## Case Study: Viable Cities (Sweden)

Viable Cities is a Swedish program focused on achieving climate-neutral cities by 2030, with a good life for all within planetary boundaries [00:29:10]. It is a mission-oriented program funded by three Swedish government agencies (Vinnova, Swedish Energy Agency, Formas) [00:29:48] with over 100 member organizations representing a quadruple helix (companies, public organizations, academia, civil society) [00:30:02].

### Purpose of Portfolio Strategy

The main purpose of their portfolio strategy is to align climate transition and sustainability efforts for more impactful achievement of their mission [00:30:27]. This involves a holistic and systemic view to overcome fragmentation and "projectification" in research, innovation, and implementation, providing directionality and reflexivity [00:30:40].

### Key Tools and Approaches

*   **Climate City Contract** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>: A flagship effort initiated in 2019, this document formalizes commitments between nine Swedish cities and four government agencies. It's a negotiated collaboration for faster climate transition, revised and signed yearly, stewarding ownership and commitments to the portfolio [00:33:00]. This contract helps mobilize political leadership at the local level [01:53:16].
*   **Transition Lab** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>: A mechanism for accelerating learning for climate transition among municipalities, citizens, and other stakeholders. It clarifies common direction, leverages synergies, renews decision-making processes, and builds dynamic capabilities for change [00:34:09].
*   **Open Calls** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>: Used to find interested parties and focus efforts, even with limited funding. For example, the **Climate Smart Cities Challenge** works with cities outside Sweden (Brazil, Uganda, Colombia, UK) to connect across portfolios and countries [01:13:30]. This links to existing national bilateral collaborations and foreign missions [01:38:35].
*   **Grants as a Lever** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:42">[01:14:42]</a>: Funding projects to trigger innovations in urban governance and learn from dialogues with citizens and stakeholders to influence future grant calls [01:14:47].

### Learnings and Role of Stewardship

Viable Cities sees its role as a "mission driver," connecting various stakeholders (governmental agencies, municipalities) and their respective portfolios of needs and challenges [01:11:14]. They coordinate, inspire, create collaboration opportunities, conduct analysis, and advocate [01:11:48]. A high emphasis is placed on cities and citizens, viewing municipalities as facilitators of a wider, [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | multi-stakeholder]] approach [01:12:06].

Key learnings include:
*   **Portfolio of portfolios** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>: The idea that achieving the mission requires aligning and connecting efforts through learning mechanisms involving different actors and governance levels. This includes developing "open interfaces" between portfolios [00:36:04].
*   **Centrality of city-level portfolios** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>: For a mission like "climate neutral cities," city-level portfolios are naturally central [00:37:17].
*   **Sense-making process** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>: Crucial for critically understanding and refining the emerging practice of mission-oriented or transformative portfolios, moving beyond a sole focus on "portfolio of projects" [00:39:41].
*   **Nature of portfolio elements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>: It's important to ask "portfolio of what?" â€“ considering not just innovations or projects, but also challenges, needs, and barriers to include in the transformative portfolio [00:40:26].
*   **Focus on specific challenge areas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:09">[01:25:09]</a>: While the mission is broad, identifying specific challenge areas (e.g., mobility due to high CO2 emissions) and asking municipalities to prioritize needs helps create common ground [01:25:35]. Often, policy and investment barriers are higher priorities than pure tech solutions [01:27:26].
*   **Capacity building and innovation management** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:45">[01:27:45]</a>: These are central to achieving transformative change [01:27:49].
*   **International collaboration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>: Connecting to international portfolios is essential, as most innovation happens outside Sweden. Direct in-person connections and partnerships with organizations like UN-Habitat are valuable [01:36:18]. Working with open calls helps find interested global partners [01:37:01].
*   **Humble approach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>: Meeting cities and stakeholders with humbleness and humility, facing them where they are, is critical due to diverse contexts [01:34:25].

## Case Study: Future by Lund (Sweden)

Future by Lund is an [[innovation_ecosystems_and_portfolio_management | innovation platform]] at the municipality of Lund, a university city in southern Sweden, with a focus on knowledge and international connections [00:44:33].

### Operating Environment

The platform connects companies, organizations, city departments, and university faculties in a highly [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | multi-stakeholder environment]] [00:46:28]. Key principles include accepting fragmentation, acknowledging no single authority, and emphasizing trust, negotiation, and timing [00:46:47]. The environment is dynamic, with projects and organizations moving in and out based on their own logic [00:47:08].

### Why Work with [[managing_innovation_portfolios | Portfolios]]?

The need for a new framework like portfolio management arises from the necessity to:
*   Identify common problems or barriers and opportunities for collective action across multiple organizations [00:50:42].
*   Curate and strategically develop the movement of activities across actor groups and thematic boundaries over time [00:50:55].
*   Communicate the collective assets and strength of the ecosystem [00:51:20].
*   Bundle results from contributing actors and trace system-level transformation [00:51:34].

Benefits include:
*   Establishing a common vocabulary and frame of reference for collective management of the portfolio [00:52:01].
*   Providing a tool for visualizing strengths, weaknesses, and gaps (e.g., lack of forward-looking or exploratory activities) [00:52:54].
*   Forming a basis for strategic discussions about resource investment and aligning resources [00:53:21].
*   Tracking movement of activities across the "playing field" over time (e.g., from fuzzy front-end to implementation) [00:53:45].
*   Connecting activities and projects to assets in the [[innovation_ecosystems_and_portfolio_management | innovation ecosystem]] to facilitate matching ideas with resources [00:54:05].

### Key Approaches and Role of Stewardship

Future by Lund's framework is a work in progress, built on three sub-models: mapping innovation assets (following the Global Institute for Innovation Districts model), the Innovation Facets Model, and annual snapshots of portfolio dynamism [00:55:35].

Their role is primarily **facilitative**:
*   **Neutral Facilitator**: Being neutral (not earning money, not owning anything) allows them to move in the "gaps" between business, city, and university, overcoming traditional silos and political fluctuations [01:17:58].
*   **Idea Trackers/Connectors**: Constantly engaging in meetings, asking what partners need, identifying potential, and matching ideas with resources or initiating pre-studies [01:16:50]. They help clarify common drives and needs to tie knots between different stakeholders [01:32:07].
*   **Team-Based Approach**: A small team with diverse, complementary skills (technical, social capital, creative) builds social capital within the ecosystem [01:20:28].
*   **Focus on Relationships**: Building trust and encouraging collaboration, as exemplified by the "barbecue model" â€“ bringing people together who want to achieve something [01:21:46].
*   **Visualizing Progress**: Using tools like the Innovation Facets Model overlaid with their "zone model" to map projects and discuss movement from exploration to implementation, identifying gaps or needed stakeholders [00:56:51]. This creates a common visual map to see connections [00:58:49].
*   **"Impact by Proxy"**: Their goal is to create the environment for others (companies, city departments) to take over and implement solutions, leading to impact [00:57:41].

### [[Evaluating impact of innovation portfolios | Evaluating impact]] and Legitimacy

[[Evaluating impact of innovation portfolios | Evaluating impact]] for transformative change and mission-oriented approaches is challenging, as standard models often fall short [01:42:36]. It's not just about cutting CO2 emissions, but also building the "muscle" for transformative change and enhancing collective learning capacity [01:43:32].

Future by Lund tracks system transformation using a "layer model" inspired by Vinnova's Veenvex program [01:01:50]:
1.  **Base Investment**: Initial funding (e.g., from Vinnova and municipality) [01:03:55].
2.  **Leveraged Projects**: Additional projects initiated through this investment [01:02:26].
3.  **Additional Activities**: Projects initiated by partners from the leveraged projects [01:02:35].
4.  **Critical Events**: Storytelling process tracing significant [[multistakeholder_engagement_in_innovation_ecosystems | multi-stakeholder]] events that indicate systemic change [01:02:42].

This approach uses project investments as a proxy for gathering force and tracks changes in collaborative partners and funders, visualizing scale-up effects of exploratory activities [01:03:02].

For **political legitimacy**, especially for long-term goals and exploratory projects with "invisible results," it's crucial to:
*   **Relay the mandate** from higher policy levels (EU, national government) [01:49:38]. These broader policies provide a stable "flag post" when city-level political questions fluctuate [01:49:50].
*   **Emphasize multiple purposes**: Climate transition is linked to creating "better daily lives for citizens," encompassing multiple outcomes beyond just CO2 reduction [01:52:16].
*   **Use the [[innovation_portfolio_management | portfolio]] model as a language**: It helps explain why risky, exploratory activities are necessary, showing how different efforts stick together and are valuable collectively, thereby legitimizing the approach on various levels [01:53:32].

The challenge of [[evaluating_impact_of_innovation_portfolios | evaluating impact]] in transformative innovation remains an open research question [01:45:26]. The focus tends to be on tracking transformative change processes in a structured way, establishing strategic direction, identifying indicators of success, and using developmental or formative evaluation to inform continuous strategic change [01:45:42]. This includes process tracking and inclusive agreement on indicators, allowing for continuous feedback to stakeholders [01:46:51].

Learning history approaches are being tested to institutionalize reflexivity sessions within municipalities, moving from experimentation to a regular practice for accelerating learning [01:55:51].

The 20th-century model of government, designed for predictable environments with established routines and available knowledge bases, has been shown to be insufficient by crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This era reminds us that stability is often fictional and the future highly uncertain, necessitating that governments embrace uncertainty rather than stand still, as the cost of late action or inaction can be terribly high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Urgent Need for [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]]

The challenges of our time are global, complex, and deeply systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Serious vulnerabilities exist in global value chains, resource management, and planetary boundaries impose hard deadlines that disregard risk appetite or willingness to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. We are in a "decisive decade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, where the biggest risk is "doing too little too late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Governments must use current investments, such as those in response to the pandemic, to transform entire systems like production, mobility, energy, food, education, and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. These transformations require political leadership and the ability to "prepare rather than react" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, shifting culture, behavior, and work practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### The "Never Normal" Reality

The concept of "normal" has been revealed as a myth; we are not moving from one stable equilibrium to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Instead, we face a "never normal situation" of continuous fluidity, flux, and turbulence, requiring constant adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The "war on the virus" metaphor is imperfect because there is no clear enemy or finite end point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Instead, we should view the virus as part of an ecology, a complex and adaptive living system that requires human and living solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This highlights biological interdependence and, more importantly, moral interdependence, emphasizing that we are all in relationships with one another, and the crisis disproportionately affects the most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Shifting Paradigms in Governance

Crises like the pandemic highlight two competing worldviews:
*   **The World of Control**: Where societal structures, organizations, and management models were created with the assumption of control, clear answers, and linear planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This is still deeply embedded in culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **The World of Uncertainty**: Where we must face the fact that we do not have all the right answers, and learning is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

In this new reality, the ability to learn, and the speed of learning, are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. This isn't about finding a "best practice" to implement, but about "emergent learning," where "what is best constantly keeps changing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### From Performance to Capacity Management

Governments should move from performance management to capacity management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This increases the learning capacity of public organizations, encouraging them to learn new things and constantly develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. Hierarchy, often associated with performance management, can hinder learning due to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.

Key mindset shifts for capacity-focused governance:
*   **From optimization to resilience**: Building in ramp-up or spillover capacity rather than paring down every resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **From quantitative to qualitative indicators**: Listening to ethnographic stories and qualitative data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.
*   **From output to outcomes**: Focusing on broader results rather than just immediate deliverables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.
*   **From linear to exponential approaches**: Recognizing that small inputs can have profound, non-linear effects at a systemic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **From scarcity to abundance/growth mindsets**: Allowing for continuous learning, change, and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.
*   **From stable equilibrium to iterative work**: Embracing experimentation, adjustment, and sustained improvements through prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.
*   **From siloed thinking to integration**: Recognizing that local sub-optimization can lead to global improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

## Guiding Principles for [[innovation_in_public_administration | Public Administration]] in Uncertainty

Governments should be guided by their vision and core values, using them as "lighthouses" or anchors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. However, they should not be anchored by specific worldviews or assumptions about how things will unfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

### Embracing Futures Thinking and Experimentation

*   **Scenario Planning**: Governments should consider and contemplate different versions of the future, telling themselves stories that challenge deeply held beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. This helps question assumptions and update priors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Ignoring "unpalatable" futures because they are difficult to accept is damaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory and [[role_of_innovation_in_public_administration | Innovation Governance]]**: Integrate a future-oriented approach into the main processes of government and parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
*   **Culture of Experimentation**: Establish processes where government and other actors explore joint missions and various scenarios through a culture of experimentation and learning, using shared portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **Risk-Managed Regulatory Work**: Governments need capabilities like "sandboxes" or exploratory regulatory work to allow for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

### The Role of Leadership

Leaders in government must balance different tensions and polarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. They must be rooted in the present while thinking about the future, minding both micro and macro levels, and navigating between immediate and long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>. The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold opposing thoughts in the head and continue to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.

Leaders also need to celebrate learning, recognizing that even negative results are valuable for the insights they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.

## Building Trust and Engagement

Trust does not mean adhering to a position indefinitely; it means being transparent that decisions change as new evidence emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. Citizens can participate in complex issues, and their ability to do so is often underestimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.

### Government as an Ecosystem Steward

The state should feel empowered to lead investment and play a strong facilitative role in public outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. This requires:
*   **Whole-of-Government Approach**: Thinking across agencies and ensuring joined-up work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
*   **Whole-of-Nation Coordination**: Governments must facilitate connections between multiple sectors (private, community) and individual active citizens to harness collective potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.
*   **Co-creation**: People buy into what they help create and trust things when involved in their creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. This means participatory government that brings different ideas together to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.
*   **Relationship Building**: Focus on cultivating strong relationships between different actors and layers of governance (public, private, civil society) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. Trust is built on credibility, reliability, and intimacy â€“ understanding each other's viewpoints through dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **Engaging Citizens**: Governments should use tools like design thinking methodology and transdisciplinary research to materialize ideas and prototype engagement with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. This is particularly important at the city level, where many transformations converge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.
*   **Learning as a Catalyst for Change**: Instead of relying solely on power, authority, or rational persuasion, foster learning by experience to motivate internal change in citizens, especially for vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.

## Personal Commitments for the Future of [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation in the Public Sector]]

*   **Understanding Differential Effects**: Always consider how policies and events might affect different communities unequally, especially the most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>.
*   **Building Quality in Relationships and Capabilities**: Support the building of quality relationships and capabilities for co-creating the future within government and with all actors in the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>.
*   **Concentrating on Relationship Building**: Focus on building the quality of relationships because important things happen in the relationships between actors, not just by individual efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to move from a controlling to a facilitating state, emphasizing the ability to learn, fostering a sense of urgency for action, and shaping quality relationships across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

The modern world is characterized by rapid change and an increasingly unpredictable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. To navigate this uncertainty and effectively address disruptions, public administrations must become [[anticipatory innovation | anticipatory]] and adaptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This necessitates a shift towards [[anticipatory innovation governance framework | anticipatory innovation governance]], moving from a stability-seeking, bureaucratic model to one that is dynamic by design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.

## The Need for Anticipatory Innovation Governance

Citizens today experience excellent, customer-focused services from the private sector and expect the same from the public sector: services that are efficient, innovative, personalized, and technology-enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that public administration *can* be agile and responsive, adapting quickly to new ways of working and communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This "liquefaction moment," where the unthinkable becomes reality, offers a unique opportunity to radically reshape the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

## Pillars of Anticipatory Innovation Governance

Achieving a future-fit public sector requires a multi-faceted approach:

### 1. Embracing Innovation and Transformation
The public sector must innovate and transform how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This involves being innovative and agile, formalizing agile working practices like remote working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. It also means moving beyond traditional policy tools like regulation or taxes, and instead using broader tools of convening and stewardship of whole systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.

### 2. Strategic Foresight and Future Thinking
Instead of starting with the present, public institutions should imagine new futures they desire and mobilize stakeholders around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This requires using foresight scenarios and future thinking to explore what might happen, acknowledging the future's uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Livingfutures.org:** A resource for creative work with future scenarios, particularly in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Design Methods and Foresight:** Combining these allows for immersion and exploration of future stories, enabling empathy with future citizens or decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Scouting for Change:** Detecting early signals of change and giving them names helps decision-makers and policymakers engage with emerging issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. For example, recognizing the "gig" economy and "human cloud" before widely adopted terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.
*   **Scenario Planning:** A methodical, albeit sometimes tedious, process for exploring different futures, undertaken every three to five years by entities like Singapore's Center for Strategic Futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.

### 3. Collaborative and Open Structures
Collaboration outside the government ecosystem is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This includes cooperation and exchange of good practices with other governments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, co-designing with many decision-makers, experts, and citizens to explore futures and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Public organizations are becoming more open by design, engaging with various stakeholders and viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

### 4. Data-Driven Policy Making
The importance of using data and analytics for building evidence-based policy making and finding innovative solutions cannot be overstated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This allows for hyper-personalization of services and distribution of delivery, moving away from purely centralized control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.

### 5. Co-creation with Citizens
Promoting active citizenship and creating platforms to connect directly with people is crucial for co-creating services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### 6. Workforce Development and New Leadership
*   **Strategic Workforce Planning:** Recruiting innovative and collaborative civil servants, redesigning jobs and processes to enable greater efficiency and innovative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Upskilling and reskilling civil servants to keep pace with new technologies and complex societal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Essential skills include critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and anticipating future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The most important skill is the ability to continuously learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Learning Organization:** Public administration should become a learning organization, able to learn from the past and anticipate the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **New Leadership:** Leaders must discover what kind of change is needed, taking leadership for exploration, openness, and discovery rather than control and detailed administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This involves exploring problems, leveraging empathy with citizens' needs, navigating ambiguity, and insisting on rehearsing and experimenting with the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Challenges and Overcoming Inertia
Governments are typically built for predictability, stability, and control, acting as a "last resort of stability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>. This can make them resistant to change, like "jelly" that wobbles but returns to its original form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.

Key challenges to overcome include:
*   **Mindsets and Structures:** Current mindsets and legacy structures can be incompatible with desired future states, impeding agile ways of working or the adoption of new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.
*   **Unchallenged Futures:** Certain futures are "already being written" without full awareness, such as the increasing influence of digital giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>, or entrenched narratives like capitalism and perpetual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. These "official futures" need to be challenged and rethought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
*   **Financial Constraints:** Austerity mindsets can lead to competitive behavior, whereas [[anticipatory innovation | innovative]] futures require a more collaborative, open, and creative approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.

## Emerging Capabilities for the Public Sector
To remain relevant and effective, the public sector needs to develop specific capabilities:
*   **Reframing Problems:** The ability to take problems away from policy silos and reframe them in ways citizens understand and that motivate public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. Examples include reframing climate change beyond just energy to food and clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>, or shifting from GDP to well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.
*   **Ethics of Innovation:** As public organizations become more open and innovations put pressure on civil servants, the ability to think about one's own ethics and biases, and incorporate diverse perspectives, becomes critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a>.
*   **Diverse Analytical Capacities:** Moving beyond historical, backward-looking analytical tools to integrate diverse viewpoints, including ethnographic analysis alongside statistical and economic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **"Trim Tab" Leadership:** Like the small trim tab on a ship's rudder that initiates a large turn, small innovations or individual actions can have a massive, multiplicative impact on complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

## Conclusion: A Constant Push for a Better Future
[[anticipatory_innovation_and_engaging_with_the_future | Engaging with the future]] requires a "constant push proactively all the time" with various instruments and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>. If this push is not maintained, governments risk lapsing back into old, less effective ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:39">[01:16:39]</a>. By embracing [[anticipatory innovation and strategic foresight in public policy | strategic foresight]], fostering agile and open structures, nurturing diverse talent, and promoting an optimistic yet critical mindset, the public sector can not only meet societal expectations but also actively shape a "better normal" for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:53">[01:21:53]</a>. The future is not a singular path, and public sector actions can steer towards desirable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

[[anticipatory_innovation_and_its_importance | Anticipatory innovation governance]] is presented as a movement towards proactive governance, addressing the urgent need for governments to respond to emerging challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Why is [[Anticipatory Innovation | Anticipatory Innovation]] Important?

Governments face an acute need to respond to emerging challenges, particularly given widespread events like the pandemic, climate change, migration, and other rapidly developing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The environment now commonly features complex systems and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Historically, governments have been effective at reacting quickly and efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. However, a reactive approach to policy setting is increasingly proving inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The goal of [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] is to enable governments to be proactive, anticipating and innovatively responding to issues before they fully emerge, rather than waiting for a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Governments require both the ability to respond expediently to unforeseen challenges and to adapt, as well as the capacity to anticipate different futures and prepare for these realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This means integrating innovation and strategic insight to build systems that help policymakers learn from both approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. It also necessitates the ability to test innovations on the ground, ensure citizen voice, and partner with civil society and businesses throughout policy cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Strengthening Trust and Democracy
From the perspective of strengthening trust and democracy, being proactive instead of reactive is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. [[anticipatory_innovation_and_its_importance | Anticipatory innovation governance]] can contribute to strengthening citizens' trust towards government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> and, conversely, strengthen government's trust towards its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This is vital given growing pressures from democratic change, the economic and social consequences of the global pandemic, climate change, and the evolving digital environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Country Experiences and Initiatives

### [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance in Finland | Finland]]
Finland is actively working on [[anticipatory_innovation_and_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] in close partnership with the OECD and European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The goal is to build a functioning, practical, and implementable [[anticipatory_innovation_and_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] system that can serve as a blueprint elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Finland is at a very early stage of establishing a proper system for [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]], but is optimistic about building a new governance model to stimulate policy-making for future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Key building blocks include changes in strategic planning, particularly the move to a strategic government program system first implemented in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Other profiting steps include experiences in experimentation, enabling legislation, digitalization efforts, and adopting ecosystemic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

While Finland has experience with enhancing, mission-oriented, and adaptive innovation, the next ambition is to build an [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]] system as an integral step in strengthening strategic policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. A current lacking element is an inbuilt connection between intensive foresight work and actual political decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

The need for stronger [[Anticipatory Innovation in the Public Sector | innovation in the public sector]] is clear, focusing not just on improving present administration but increasingly on innovating for the future, despite its uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Challenges include widening the understanding of the urgency for governance system changes and motivating political decision-makers to engage in discussions about wide social contexts and consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.

New elements are needed beyond fine-tuning old processes, particularly those that uphold the public sector's responsibility as a guardian of the democratic base of societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:01">[02:10:01]</a>. This involves shifts in organizational and institutional structures, planning, decision-making processes, and mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:13">[02:22:13]</a>. The biggest changes may relate to the openness of public actions, involving citizens and stakeholders in policy-making in a proactive role, moving towards genuine co-creation and co-design approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:01">[02:23:01]</a>.

Finland aims to deepen understanding of missing elements and strengthen existing ones through cooperation with the OECD, focusing on specific policy areas for case studies to test new model elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:59">[03:57:59]</a>.

### Ireland
Ireland is also at the start of its journey in systematically introducing strategic foresight into policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:52">[02:49:52]</a>. The motivation came from reflecting on past crises (financial, COVID-19) and anticipating future ones (climate crisis), prompting questions about how the public service could be fit for purpose by 2030 and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:05">[02:56:05]</a>.

Ireland seeks to understand how mega-trends (e.g., climate crisis, biodiversity loss, population growth) will impact different public service sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:17">[02:59:17]</a>. While good policymakers always consider future trends, strategic foresight is seen as a way to dig deeper, interpret signals, and take a necessary longer-term perspective in today's policy decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:10">[02:29:10]</a>.

Ireland partnered with the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) to explore existing pockets of strategic foresight within the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:39">[02:58:39]</a>. They engaged senior policymakers to identify current practices and work through strategic foresight tools and mega-trends, drawing on best practices from Finland, Singapore, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:51">[02:59:51]</a>.

With funding from the European Commission's Technical Support Institute, Ireland plans to develop a strategic foresight action plan and build capacity across the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>. This will be undertaken within existing governance structures, plugging the strategic foresight initiative into the overall system, which includes the Public Service Leadership Board and the Public Service Innovation Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:17">[03:04:17]</a>.

The key message is that even the best strategic foresight system is irrelevant if it's not linked into the policy-making system, with insights picked up and acted upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:51">[03:17:51]</a>. Therefore, Ireland is developing both strategic foresight systems and capacity, while also improving the wider policy development system to ensure strategic foresight is integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:25">[03:22:25]</a>. This approach aims to help civil servants and policymakers develop the skills needed to address future issues by making decisions today that consider the longer term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:01">[03:42:01]</a>.

Ireland's next 18 months will focus on capacity building, strategic foresight literacy training at senior levels, and developing a case study to showcase the benefits of foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:52">[03:50:52]</a>.

### Canada
Canada has been nationally enhancing experimentation within the government for several years, with a directive to support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:26">[04:25:26]</a>. The Treasury Board Secretariat's strategic policy team aims to make government more experimental, building both supply (capacity, expertise) and demand (highlighting importance to senior executives) for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:27">[04:46:27]</a>.

*   **Definitions**: For Canada, innovation is "doing new things," while experimentation is "the process by which you measure if things work" in a rigorous way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:50">[04:49:50]</a>. The core is whether something is working and if it's better than previous approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:12">[04:52:12]</a>.
*   **Three Key Activities**:
    1.  **Building Capacity**: Running a training program, "Experimentation Works," which pairs experts with projects wanting to experiment (some experimental, some exploratory pre-experimental work) to build capacity and provide examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:23">[04:58:23]</a>.
    2.  **Supporting Community**: Fostering an experimentation community of practice through learning events and courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:44">[04:28:44]</a>.
    3.  **Systems Change**: Working to change the system to make experimentation easier and increase incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:02">[04:34:02]</a>. This includes issuing directives to deputy heads to experiment and including experimentation questions in annual departmental surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:27">[04:49:27]</a>.

*   **Common Barriers to Experimentation**:
    *   **Access to Expertise**: Lack of methodological or process expertise (e.g., how to get funding, convince leadership, do A/B testing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:07">[04:57:07]</a>.
    *   **Data**: Insufficient data to measure effectiveness or organized data storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:39">[05:07:39]</a>.
    *   **Openness to Failure**: A cultural barrier, as experiments inherently carry risk of failure. The counter-argument is that the status quo is also risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:24">[05:14:24]</a>. Experimentation can actually reduce risk by identifying what works or doesn't work early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:04">[05:22:04]</a>.
    *   **Timelines**: Experiments are often most useful in the long term, but policy demands are often immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:09">[05:28:09]</a>.
    *   **Precedent**: It's hard to do new things in government where precedent is powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:57">[05:51:57]</a>. Building case studies and examples helps overcome this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:12">[05:52:12]</a>.

There is no single right path for building experimentation; it depends on context, but the goal is to build momentum in an [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory]] way, before it becomes urgent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:13">[05:28:13]</a>.

### Sweden (Komet Committee)
Sweden's Komet Committee (Committee for Technology Innovation and Ethics) delivers policy proposals to the government to better handle rapid technology development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:03">[05:55:03]</a>. Its ambition is to increase speed towards Agenda 2030 sustainability goals and ensure responsibility for innovation and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:27">[05:57:27]</a>.

*   **Holistic Perspective**: [[systems_thinking_and_anticipatory_innovation_governance | Anticipatory governance]] requires balancing internal agency perspectives, external engagement with citizens and companies, and a holistic view for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:21">[05:59:21]</a>.
*   **Three-Part Model for Anticipatory Work**:
    1.  **Understanding**: Continuously understanding technological developments (e.g., algorithms in finance) and their policy implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:19">[05:58:19]</a>. This requires new structures, work procedures, and knowledge building within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:32">[05:59:32]</a>. Komet funds technology briefs to explain technologies and their policy perspectives to politicians and civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:51">[05:59:51]</a>. Financing for regulatory interactive activities is also proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:22">[06:01:22]</a>. Strategic foresight is a part of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:37">[06:01:37]</a>.
    2.  **Testing**: Making Sweden a testing ground for new work ways, technologies, solutions, and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:44">[06:02:44]</a>. Instead of "regulatory sandboxes," Sweden uses the concept of "regulatory greenhouses" where different actors (agencies, companies, civil servants, civil society) can jointly conduct transparent tests under real conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:05">[06:07:05]</a>. An example is speeding up the electric grid construction by bringing agencies and municipalities together for joint experiments on permitting and building processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:59">[06:09:59]</a>. A strategy for testing and experimentation is proposed, with governmental support for methodology, follow-up, incentives, and auditing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:02">[06:14:02]</a>.
    3.  **Changing**: Adopting a more agile, step-wise approach to regulation and policy change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:24">[06:22:24]</a>. This means starting with understanding, then moving to standards or agreements, and finally legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:43">[06:24:43]</a>. The Komet Committee develops small, easy-to-implement proposals instead of large reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:57">[06:25:57]</a>.

*   **Key Principles**: Collaboration, building capabilities in the public sector, and enabling all municipalities, regions, and public agencies to work with this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:04">[06:33:04]</a>. A new committee is proposed where these entities can report regulatory problems hindering innovation and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:16">[06:37:16]</a>. This is seen as a cultural journey and a multi-decade process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:02">[06:40:02]</a>.

### Basque Country (Gipuzkoa Social Innovation Lab)
The Gipuzkoa Social Innovation Lab collaborates with the OECD/OPSI to connect [[Anticipatory innovation and governance | anticipatory governance]] frameworks to a specific mission: accelerating the region's transition towards a more sustainable economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:11">[06:06:11]</a>.

*   **Distinction**: The approach distinguishes between traditional foresight (expert analysis for identifying and managing problems) and [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation]], which combines traditional foresight with a portfolio approach incorporating strong social and cultural initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:01">[06:42:01]</a>.
*   **Process**: Emphasizes iteration through different experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:47">[06:47:47]</a>.
    *   **Deep Listening**: Significant effort is placed on listening to social and cultural dynamics related to sustainability transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:16">[06:54:16]</a>.
    *   **Sense-making Capabilities**: Combining this with expert analysis and foresight to build sense-making capabilities across different levels: large-scale public sector, community-driven actions, regulation, and small-scale startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:02">[06:57:02]</a>.
    *   **Portfolio Analysis**: Analyzing the regional government's current portfolio and interconnections, as well as what emerges from deep listening processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:12">[07:09:12]</a>.

This method aims to create better infrastructure (social, political, public, private) for generating more innovative responses to emergent problems, rather than solely relying on expert analysis to predict what will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:51">[07:09:51]</a>.

### Norway
Norway is implementing a digital strategy to promote a more efficient public sector, value creation, and a simpler everyday life through digitalization, with a focus on seamless services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:29">[07:18:29]</a>. Public services should be perceived as seamless and integrated by users, regardless of the providing agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:55">[07:23:55]</a>. Developing seamless services involves both [[Anticipatory Innovation | systemic innovation]] and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:07">[07:27:07]</a>.

The government has prioritized developing seamless services for seven "life events" (major life moments where navigating public services is difficult) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:05">[07:37:05]</a>. Each has a responsible ministry, but collaboration across municipalities, county authorities, and central government agencies is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:41">[07:39:41]</a>. The Norwegian Digitalization Agency supports these life events by advising, creating cooperation arenas, and developing/testing new methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

*   **Foresight/Anticipatory Innovation Methodology**: A direct follow-up on a government whitepaper presenting foresight as a methodology and skill for public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:23">[08:00:23]</a>.
*   **Tools and Methods**: Offers updated driving force documents describing impacts on the public sector by 2030, and runs workshops to test and learn with the life events, tailoring methods to each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07">[08:07:07]</a>.
*   **Tying Anticipation to Missions**: One life event ("starting and managing a voluntary organization") is testing both foresight and mission approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:51">[08:19:51]</a>. They start by understanding the voluntary sector and exploring the future through scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:50">[08:21:50]</a>. This long view helps establish a shorter-term mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:20">[08:22:20]</a>. The next step is connecting current needs with future possibilities to prioritize new service development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:04">[08:33:04]</a>.

*   **Preliminary Insights**: Foresight helps inform and direct work, and future scenarios aid in aligning different stakeholders and agreeing on a common mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:41">[08:39:41]</a>.
*   **Working Across Silos**: Scenario planning can create a common platform, allowing representatives from different ministries and agencies to discuss driving forces and uncertain questions about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:09">[09:00:09]</a>. This fosters a common perspective for selecting solutions and identifying strategic blind spots, leading to more future-oriented and user-centric solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:41">[09:07:41]</a>.
*   **Flexible Commitment**: Norway has created an "innovation space" within the seamless services program for experimentation and testing new ways of working, cooperating, steering, and anchoring processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:11">[09:30:11]</a>. Aligning on common missions is part of this experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:02">[09:34:02]</a>.
*   **[[Anticipatory governance in technology policy | Digital Ethics and Privacy]]**: Governments need to invite technical startups, private businesses, and the voluntary sector into developing seamless services to test and learn together, which can address concerns about digital ethics and public privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:22">[09:59:22]</a>. The question of future trust is also a big consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:19">[10:04:19]</a>.

## Expert Reflections on [[Anticipatory Innovation | Anticipation]]

### [[Systems thinking and anticipatory innovation governance | Systems Thinking]] and Complexity
Current efforts are motivated by the rapid pace of events challenging democratic governments' ability to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:53">[01:39:53]</a>. It's necessary to bring insights from [[systems_thinking_and_anticipatory_innovation_governance | systems analysis]], complexity theory, strategic foresight methods, and factual expertise to bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:13">[01:40:13]</a>.

A key conviction is that the public needs to be brought into this process, particularly in the US, where public understanding is crucial for political support of new policy-making approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:11">[01:41:11]</a>. This involves developing methods to bring the grassroots (public) and experts together to think about future demands and how to meet them through civil discourse grounded in facts, rather than hyper-partisan politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.

A "roundtable process" began with an advisory panel of futures analysts and a diverse panel of experienced individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>. They identified highly disruptive, longer-range trends (e.g., advanced AI, synthetic biology, climate change, demographic shifts) and integrated foresight techniques into the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:55">[01:44:55]</a>. Discussions focused on the interaction between these rising forces and core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:55">[01:45:55]</a>. The learning is that people resist being told what to think, but respond to methods for thinking better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>.

This work is being tested in a university setting (Ohio State University) through a course, "Foresight in American Democracy," which introduces students to the roundtable process, systems analysis, expert briefings, and discussions to foster a fluid view of events in a democracy as a complex adaptive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>. The ultimate goal is a national network of such associations to support conversation about the future of democratic values and governance systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:25">[01:47:25]</a>.

### Global Challenges and Long-Term Impact
The world needs [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory governance]] concepts applied at the global level for challenges that individual or even regional governments cannot resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:10">[01:48:10]</a>. The OECD's efforts represent a hopeful shift in this direction, as it is an influential center for studying innovation best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:22">[01:48:22]</a>. The need for radical, deep innovation in governance is already upon us for planetary importance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:01">[01:49:01]</a>.

Decisions made today can influence the future for millennia, as illustrated by the challenges of radioactive waste storage (10,000-year half-life) and current proposals to bury carbon dioxide underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:23">[01:50:23]</a>. These urgent, contemporary decisions have profound long-term implications, testing the application of foresight to policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>.

### Futures Literacy and Ethical Action
The fundamental issue is humanity's preemptive, colonizing, and superior position towards the world, reflected in hierarchical, command-and-control governance systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:22">[01:54:22]</a>. Improvements within these systems may not be sufficient for desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:33">[01:54:33]</a>. Thinking in terms of seven generations, as in indigenous thought, is an appeal to live now in a way that respects the future and the world's differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:02">[01:55:02]</a>.

*   **Beyond Improvement**: The current system, with its tendency to repeat or merely improve upon the past, fundamentally reproduces objectionable things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. To stop this, the way we use the future (e.g., through dominant tendencies to reproduce past patterns) must be identified as a culprit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:23">[01:56:23]</a>.
*   **Transformation vs. Transition**: Transformation is unknowable until it happens, while transition is doable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:11">[01:57:11]</a>.
*   **Futures Literacy**: Anticipation is fundamental to life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a>. Just as people learn to read and write, they can become much better at diverse forms of anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:06">[01:58:06]</a>. A disciplinary foundation and a theory of the future are needed to underpin these activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:22">[01:58:22]</a>.
*   **Political Will and Risk**: While there's an understanding that systemic changes and paradigm shifts are necessary, institutions may not be ready to take the risk or leave their comfort zones to embrace these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:07">[02:17:07]</a>. An overemphasis on "risk mentality" can kill innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:38">[02:17:38]</a>.
*   **Paradigm Shifts**: To think about paradigm shifts, one should look to individuals who think beyond normal confines and offer them protected spaces to express their ideas, even if initially seen as "ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:46">[02:08:46]</a>. This includes looking to science fiction for foreshadowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:34">[02:09:34]</a>. Advanced artificial intelligence is cited as a current example of a potential inflection point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:25">[02:10:25]</a>.
*   **Ethical Action**: Paradigmatic change is an emergent property of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:12">[02:15:12]</a>. The focus should be on acting ethically in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:18">[02:16:18]</a>. Institutions might be "living dead" (zombies) but can serve as "good compost" for future emergence if they are willing to consider their own end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:42">[02:14:42]</a>.

### Key Levers for Jumpstarting Anticipation and Community
*   **Permission to Empower**: Empowering the people directly dealing with problems to define their own futures, hopes, and fears, making them sovereign in defining their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:37">[02:21:37]</a>.
*   **Collaboration, Co-creation, Co-design**: These are crucial for effective [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:06">[02:22:06]</a>.
*   **Humility and Willingness to Admit Ignorance**: Leaders must be willing to say "we don't know the answer" and embark on the journey together with an open mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:29">[02:22:29]</a>.

Governments must also consider the welfare of "hundreds of millions of people" during transitions, especially given the existence of nuclear weapons. Governance's proper function is to manage transitions, thinking of future people as those for whom care must be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:22">[02:25:22]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Directions
The OECD is continuing its work on [[Anticipatory Innovation | anticipatory innovation governance]] and government missions, with ongoing projects in Slovenia (future of public service scenarios), Finland (understanding and developing anticipatory systems blueprint), Ireland (building foresight capacity), Latvia, the Basque Country, and Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:03">[02:29:03]</a>. The aim is to prevent governments from becoming "locked in" and instead guide them through necessary transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:22">[02:29:22]</a>.

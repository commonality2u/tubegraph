The [[the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] was developed with a strong emphasis on [[usercentric_design_and_implementation | user-centric design and implementation]] and [[feedback_and_iterative_improvement_process | iterative improvement]], aiming to provide a valuable resource for public sector innovators worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. The project was supported by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

## Initial Research and User Needs

In 2017, the initial task was to build a toolkit for public sector innovation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. However, the prevailing thought was that the world did not need "another toolkit," a sentiment echoed in a blog post about "peak toolkit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Instead, the goal shifted to providing "signal through that noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

To understand user needs, a workshop was held at the OPSI conference in 2017 with public sector leaders and civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. The workshop explored how innovators find information, whom they reach out to, and what tools and methods they use on their innovation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This research revealed the "daily struggles for public sector innovators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. The insights gained were crucial in building the Navigator, which focuses on helping users "find the right toolkits based on their needs" rather than creating a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges and findings in toolkit usage | Challenges and Findings in Toolkit Usage]]

Extensive research into existing toolkits, including an in-depth review of approximately 500, combined with user research, highlighted several issues:
*   **Over-reliance on past tools** Innovators tend to rely on tools that worked previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Misalignment with problems** Toolkits are often chosen for superficial reasons (e.g., "bright and shiny") rather than alignment with the actual problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of skill consideration** Many toolkits do not account for existing user skills, with some requiring very advanced abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Granularity issues** Toolkits can be either too granular or too broad for the user's specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   **Learned helplessness** Especially in the public sector, polished toolkits can deter innovators from adapting them to their specific context, leading to a sense of "learned helplessness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

## Design Principles Informed by User Needs

Based on these findings, the ideal toolkit was envisioned to be:
*   **Adaptable and transferable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
*   **Approachable and user-centered** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
*   **Action-oriented** Focused on prompting action rather than just providing guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
*   **Modular** Allowing users to combine parts of different toolkits to suit their context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

The Navigator also categorizes toolkits by "innovation tasks" or "jobs to be done," which extend beyond simple problem-solving to include group behavioral jobs, approach planning jobs, and contextualization jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

## [[Feedback and iterative improvement process | Iterative Improvement and Feedback]]

The [[design_and_features_of_the_opsi_toolkit_navigator | OPSI Toolkit Navigator]] underwent several rounds of testing and improvement:
*   **Initial Design Testing** The initial designs were tested with public sector innovators to gauge their helpfulness, expectations, and desired features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.
*   **Prototype Testing** Multiple prototypes were tested with national government innovation leaders from various countries, who provided 349 pieces of feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.
*   **Significant Design Changes** This extensive feedback led to "significantly" changing the Navigator's design to better suit user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.

## Incentivizing Capacity Building and Connection

The Navigator aims to build innovative capacity by encouraging users to build or adapt their own toolkits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.
*   **Open Access** Special emphasis was placed on including freely accessible toolkits, including those requiring an email exchange but no cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptability Ranking** Toolkits that are easier to adapt, modify, and remix receive preference in the Navigator's sorting and ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>. This encourages capacity building within user teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>.
*   **Badges** Toolkits are assigned badges indicating their reusability:
    *   **Open Source Basic**: Allows for reuse, printing, and copying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Open Source Champion**: Licensed with Creative Commons for remixing and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Heroes**: Provide editable files or code, making adaptation even easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.
*   **Social Proof and Networking** Users desire "social proof" that new methods have been successfully tried by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. To address this, the Navigator connects toolkits to the OPSI case study platform, which contains hundreds of innovation cases in government with reported impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. It also connects to the OPSI platform's user base of over 1700 public sector innovators globally, fostering discussions, reviews, and connections for advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>.
*   **User Contributions** The Navigator allows users to submit new toolkits they find valuable, provided they are freely accessible, relevant to the public sector, and focused on stimulating action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:45:00">[30:45:00]</a>. Submissions are reviewed before publication, with a default to include as many as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:00">[31:39:00]</a>.

The OPSI Toolkit Navigator is a continuous work in progress, constantly developing and seeking feedback from its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>.

The green transition, recognized as one of the biggest challenges of our time, is not solely about technology or policies, but fundamentally about peopleâ€”how they live, work, and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Progress in this area is impossible with technical solutions alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A deep understanding of human behavior is essential for this major transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The OECD's commitment to supporting governments in tackling climate challenges more effectively is reflected in reports like "Mind Shift Green Lift: Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, which aims to help governments bridge the gap between ambitious goals and real-world impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Role of Human Behavior

Human behavior is central to achieving a green, low-carbon future, requiring changes in the behaviors of individuals, businesses, and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Behavioral science offers valuable insights into how to encourage these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Research suggests that shifting behaviors in key areas such as transport, food consumption, and energy use could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70% by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Understanding how people make decisions allows governments to design more effective strategies that drive lasting change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This is particularly crucial for demand-side strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The OECD's survey on Environmental Policy and Individual Behavior (EPIC) highlights the importance of the availability, affordability, and convenience of sustainable options in driving sustainable behaviors at the household level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. For instance, policies promoting electric vehicles (EVs) must be accompanied by infrastructure investments like accessible charging stations or affordable public transport alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Overarching Considerations for the Green Transition

Beyond technical solutions, the green transition requires a focus on:
*   **Fiscal and Financial Resilience** Ensuring government finances remain robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Fairness and Equity** Ensuring the transition is just for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Public Support** Garnering broad support for policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The OECD's multi-disciplinary "Net Zero Plus" project addresses these complex [[tools_and_strategies_for_green_governance | challenges]], aiming to deliver a rapid, just, and resilient transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing resilience to climate impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. A key paper within this project focuses on demand-side policies for climate change mitigation, drawing on work from the IEA and OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. It offers guidance on how behavioral science can support more effective interventions in sectors like energy use in buildings, transport, waste, and diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Trust and Citizen Engagement

A significant challenge in the green transition is the low level of trust in government and public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. OECD surveys indicate that less than four out of ten citizens in 30 member countries trust their governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. While most citizens believe governments should prioritize reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting the climate transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, only 42% are confident their country will achieve these goals within the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This highlights a "trust gap" between expectations and perceived capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

The role of the government-citizen interface in driving climate action is a key focus area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Understanding this interface is essential for implementing policies that resonate with individuals and lead to meaningful climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

[[democracy_and_public_participation_in_policy | Citizen participation in policy making]] is a major driving force for building trust in government and public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Behavioral science can help bridge the trust gap by aligning policies with public expectations, fostering trust, and making it easier for citizens to engage and participate, partly by removing barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy

The "Mind Shift Green Lift" report identifies six key trends illustrating how governments are harnessing behavioral science to accelerate the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, based on an analysis of over 100 case studies from more than 30 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>:

### 1. Informing Policies at Every Stage of the Policy Cycle
Traditionally used for fine-tuning or communication, behavioral science is now applied from the very start of the policy cycle to better understand behavioral challenges and design smarter, more effective policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Example: France's Repairability Index**
    The French Behavioral Science team developed a repairability index for electronic products. By applying behavioral science throughout the policy cycle, they first identified that 62% of consumers discarded broken electronic devices without considering repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. They then designed and tested labels to empower consumers to make informed choices. The successful label was implemented, leading to consumers increasingly opting for higher repairability scores and manufacturers introducing more repairable laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. This intervention was effective on both consumer demand and product supply sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

### 2. Driving Climate Adaptation Efforts
Behavioral science is increasingly used for climate adaptation, which involves adjusting behaviors to deal with immediate and long-term effects of climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. This includes encouraging behaviors to prevent wildfires or guiding actions during crises like floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Example: Australia's Drought Assistance**
    During a severe drought in Australia (2017-2019), farmer uptake of available assistance was low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. The Australian government's Behavioral Economics Team (BETA) identified barriers such as farmers not knowing how to concretely ask for help, overly complicated application processes, and a stigma attached to asking for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. Information was also not personalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. BETA recommended reframing support with behavioral science to encourage seeking assistance *before* a crisis point, and establishing trusted local points of contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

### 3. Predicting and Accounting for Public Acceptability of Green Reforms
Governments use behavioral science to anticipate and address public reactions to green policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. By leveraging data, especially longitudinal data, governments can gauge citizens' climate awareness, support, preferences, and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. This helps design clearer, more accessible policies aligned with public values, ultimately building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.
*   **Example: Netherlands' SME Sustainability Investments**
    The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy's behavioral science team conducted extensive research (surveys, focus groups, interviews, online experiments) to understand behavioral drivers and barriers for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) investing in sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. They found that while 64% of SMEs were inclined to be more sustainable, only 5-18% had taken feasible steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. Motivators included high energy prices and cost savings, while barriers included high perceived costs (time/money) and preference for other priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. These insights were instrumental in shaping tailored policy approaches for SMEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

### 4. Boosting [[citizen_participation_in_policy_making | Citizen Participation in Environmental Policies]]
Governments and civil society actors are proactively using behavioral science to engage citizens in shaping and implementing green policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. This mobilizes diverse groups and creates more opportunities for [[democracy_and_public_participation_in_policy | public involvement in decision making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. This addresses the "trust gap" identified by OECD surveys, where many citizens feel they lack meaningful chances to participate in policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
*   **Example: Ireland's National Dialogue on Climate Action**
    Led by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, this initiative engages citizens directly in climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. Its goals include raising awareness, motivating climate action, and empowering citizens to adopt sustainable behaviors, with findings informing policy responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. Since 2021, over 12,000 citizens have participated in annual climate conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. A key outcome is a behavioral insights dashboard that allows policymakers to integrate evidence from social and behavioral studies into policy design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

### 5. Increasing Demand for Sustainable Goods, Services, and Technologies
Governments are increasingly leveraging behavioral science to drive demand for sustainable options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. Demand-side policies are essential, with potential to reduce emissions by up to 70% by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. This includes designing labels for sustainable consumer choices, removing barriers to using green services like public transport, and encouraging adoption of green technologies such as heat pumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   **Example: Denmark's Climate Labels for Food**
    The Danish Competition and Consumer Authority tested two types of climate labels for food: a "best-in-class" label and a "scale" label (ranking products by climate impact from low to high) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. Consumers preferred the scale label, which improved their ability to identify climate-friendly alternatives, but it did not lead to a significant change in overall purchasing behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. The aggregate effect on CO2 emissions was neutral because some consumers increased their emissions. The team suggested that more specific, clearer information that resonates with consumers is needed for labels to be more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. This highlights that widespread behavior change requires not only better labeling but also consumer engagement and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

### 6. Building Resilience to Climate Misinformation
Governments are using behavioral science to understand susceptibility to misinformation and develop strategies to counteract its spread, strengthening [[democracy_and_public_participation_in_policy | democratic resilience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>.
*   **Example: Canada's PARCA Initiative**
    Canada's Program of Applied Research on Climate Action (PARCA) conducts national surveys and in-depth studies to assess the Canadian public's susceptibility to climate-related misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. The aim is to understand how people think, feel, and act when confronted with misinformation, and identify the most harmful types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. In 2024, PARCA ran a randomized control trial to test behaviorally informed interventions to boost resilience to misinformation. Interventions focused on encouraging accuracy assessment, strengthening digital literacy, or preemptive refutation (correcting false claims) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. Enhancing digital media literacy and active preemptive refutations were most effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. However, providing only passive information about finding misinformation made people more skeptical and less accurate in identifying true headlines, suggesting unintended consequences if not carefully designed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.

## Moving from Insights to Action

To accelerate the green transition, governments should:
*   **Harness Behavioral Science to Trigger Positive Social Tipping Points** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>: Identify critical moments and behaviors that can spark systemic change, amplifying traditional policies and ensuring enduring, widespread behavior shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.
*   **Drive Demand for Sustainable Choices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>: Encourage adoption of sustainable behaviors (e.g., energy-efficient products, sustainable transport) to create a ripple effect. Behavioral science tools like default options and dynamic social norms can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
*   **Engage Citizens as Active Participants** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>: Empower people as agents of change by reducing [[challenges_and_benefits_of_participatory_processes | barriers to participation]], building trust, and aligning policies with public expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
*   **Strengthen Decision-Making within Governments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>: Integrate behavioral science into government decision-making processes for environmental policies to reduce biases and improve effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>.

### Caveats for Application
*   **Avoid Placing Entire Burden on Individuals**: The aim is to empower consumers, users, and citizens as active participants in the green transition, not to solely burden them with responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Science is Not a Silver Bullet**: While important, behavioral change is just one piece of a broader strategy that also requires technology and systemic changes for meaningful progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
*   **Broad Definition of "Demand-Side Policies"**: In this context, demand-side approaches extend beyond individual choices to include governments and industries, recognizing their power in driving procurement efforts and systematic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. Achieving real impact demands collaboration across all sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

## Academic and Practitioner Perspectives

The OECD has been a frontrunner in using behavioral economics for policymaking since 2008, having built an impressive network of specialists interested in using behavioral insights globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

### Key Observations
*   **Integration Across the Policy Cycle**: Including individuals from the very beginning helps ensure policy problems are correctly identified, as policymakers might otherwise solve problems different from the real barriers faced by citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. This approach makes policies more practical and widely accepted, fostering systemic change beyond isolated behavior shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.
*   **Localized and Adaptive Climate Solutions**: Behavioral approaches are highly relevant for tailored, community-specific strategies, especially as climate impacts worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. Micro-interventions can have a significant impact in immediate responses to localized issues like wildfires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.
*   **Demand-Side Policy Importance**: Recognizing demand-side policies is crucial, as they hold 30% to 40% of the potential for emissions reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. This involves fostering "doing sustainability" (habits and actions) rather than just "buying sustainability" (choosing sustainable products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>.
*   **Epistemological Crisis and Trust**: Society faces an epistemological crisis where the same facts are interpreted differently across "social tribes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. Behavioral approaches and deliberation can help find platforms for true deliberative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>. The widespread trust crisis in government, with low levels of trust worldwide, necessitates behavioral approaches to reinstall trust in experts and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>.
*   **Backlash Against Green Initiatives**: Despite a growing "greenlash," especially from populist movements, behavioral approaches offer valuable tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. They are adaptable, local, and participative ("speedboats" rather than "tankers"), and can help build horizontal trust and motivate sustainability at smaller scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. Engaging in "deep listening" and empathy can counteract polarization and groupthink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.
*   **AI and Personalization**: The increasing role of AI can help personalize behavioral interventions to different target groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. By using computational social science and machine learning, it's possible to identify clusters of people and develop more effective, tailored tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>.
*   **Regulation of Supply Side**: Behavioral science can play a role in better regulating the supply side, using tools like "budges" (behaviorally informed regulations) to restrict and regulate suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.
*   **Policy Sequencing**: It is important to test combinations of fiscal and behavioral policies, considering how softer policies might be phased in before harder ones to increase legitimacy and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

### Government Initiatives
*   **Germany's Citizen-Centered Policy Design**: The German federal government is developing structures to leverage behavioral science from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>.
    *   **Behavioral Insights Connect for Green Transition (BIG)**: A network where scientists and policymakers exchange regularly, enabling direct communication of policy questions to behavioral scientists who then create peer-reviewed policy briefings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>.
    *   **Social Science Surgery**: A piloting format where scientists and policymakers meet in small workshops to jointly develop solutions, ensuring solutions are evidence-based, legally sound, and practically feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>.
    *   **Policy Check for Citizen Centeredness**: A set of tools encouraging policymakers to incorporate citizen insights when designing policies, providing advice and resources for gaining these insights through small-scale research projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>.

### Challenges
*   **Climate Adaptation vs. Mitigation**: There is a concern that increased focus and financial investment in climate adaptation, which is often seen as more politically acceptable and has quicker, more visible effects, might divert resources and attention away from essential mitigation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:12">[01:24:12]</a>. While adaptation is crucial, it's akin to "mopping with the tap open" if mitigation is neglected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:37">[01:25:37]</a>. There is a clear hierarchy: avoiding (mitigation) comes first, then adapting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:55">[01:27:55]</a>. It is important to study the potential backfiring effects of promoting adaptation behaviors on mitigation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:16">[01:27:16]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Interventions for Industry**: Behavioral interventions are applicable not only to individuals but also to industries and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>. Examples like default options can work for both private households and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. Behavioral insights are useful in Greening employee behavior, within industry associations, and in negotiations, particularly regarding social norms within and between groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>. However, the use of behavioral insights by commercial entities raises questions of legitimacy and responsibility, differing from government-led "regulatory nudging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>.

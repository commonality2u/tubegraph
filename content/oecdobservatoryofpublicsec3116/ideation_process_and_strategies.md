The [[ideation_process | ideation process]] moves beyond merely collecting ideas, like sticky notes on a wall, to become a more strategic endeavor focused on the operational context [00:00:32]. It's about generating "good ideas" and then narrowing them down to determine which ones to test [00:00:49].

## Developing Innovation Proposals

An [[developing_innovation_proposals | innovation proposal]] is crucial for transforming an idea into an actionable plan [00:01:33]. Regardless of how innovative an idea is, it needs to be developed and fit with the reality of its context [00:01:41]. There isn't one universal format for a successful proposal, as it's dependent on the context [00:02:08]. This applies whether it's an email to a manager, prototyping with colleagues, or an official budget proposal [00:02:20]. The proposal stage can be nerve-wracking, as it's a moment of validation or a time to rally support for resources [00:02:57].

### Tips for Successful Public Sector Innovation Proposals

1.  **Understand the Strategic Context**
    It's vital to appreciate the strategic environment in which your idea exists [00:03:40]. An idea, no matter how good, will not gain traction if the context is not right [00:03:50]. Consider related agendas, political or executive leadership messages, and how to frame or reframe your idea to align with or appear to align with the current context [00:04:06].

2.  **Rally People to Your Cause**
    A key challenge with [[innovation_strategies | innovation]] is its newness, meaning there are often no existing mental models or examples for people to reference [00:04:41]. Therefore, you need to communicate effectively with your audience and tailor your message to their preferences [00:04:56]. This includes understanding if decision-makers prefer data, stories, or examples from other agencies [00:05:07]. Also, consider who would be the most effective voice for your proposal, even if it's not you [00:05:42].

3.  **Don't Assume Understanding**
    The merits of your idea may not be immediately apparent or understandable to others [00:06:06]. Innovative ideas can easily be misinterpreted [00:06:15]. You may have personal experience, research, or insights that others lack, so you need to make your proposal real and meaningful for them [00:06:27]. This can be achieved through:
    *   **Prototyping:** Making the idea visible and tangible [00:06:48].
    *   **Peer Voices:** Finding others who can advocate for the idea [00:06:53].
    *   **Concrete Use Cases:** Pointing to current problems and successful instances where similar initiatives have worked elsewhere [00:06:59].
    *   **Scenario Thinking:** Exploring different future scenarios [00:07:15].

4.  **Know Your Numbers**
    Have a clear understanding of what you're asking for, why, and the expected results [00:07:31]. While many prefer certainty, especially in the public sector, you need to be prepared for questions [00:07:44]. The burden of proof for [[innovation_strategies | innovation]] is higher than for the status quo [00:08:02].
    *   **Highlight Costs of Status Quo:** Emphasize the risks and costs of not changing [00:08:21].
    *   **Start Small:** Propose a small test case [00:08:42].
    *   **Promise with Confidence:** Acknowledge uncertainty but present a strong case based on reasons [00:08:54].
    *   **Reference Other Examples:** Point to successful implementations in other agencies, countries, or the private sector [00:09:18].

5.  **Be Ready for the Unexpected**
    Anticipate potential outcomes: What if your proposal is approved and scaled up? What if new information undercuts your hypothesis? [00:09:51]

6.  **Maximize Your Chances (Multiple Payoffs)**
    While "fast failure" is a concept in [[innovation_strategies | innovation]], the public sector often demands results [00:10:31]. Think about how your idea can deliver value even if the primary outcome isn't as hoped [00:10:51]. Can it generate learnings, develop relationships, or offer other benefits regardless of its "success"? [00:10:59]

7.  **Be Open to Change**
    Don't try to anticipate everything [00:11:32]. Leave space for input from decision-makers, as senior leaders often want to contribute their perspective and experience rather than just sign off on a fully formed plan [00:11:36].

### Common Issues with Proposals

*   **Decision-Maker Misunderstanding:** Despite clear explanations, decision-makers might not fully grasp new or innovative ideas, leading to confusion later [00:18:33]. It's crucial to watch for warning signs that there's a disconnect between what you're saying and what they expect [00:19:17].
*   **Lack of Flexibility:** Innovative projects will inevitably face unexpected issues [00:19:49]. Avoid critical dependencies in your proposal that make you vulnerable to surprises [00:20:01]. Don't be too specific about details that could change [00:20:27].
*   **No Escape Clause:** Consider how you can exit a project if it's not working as hoped or if it veers in an undesirable direction [00:20:38]. This also applies if the project becomes too reliant on you, hindering its sustainability [00:21:40].
*   **Balance of Information:** Avoid patronizing decision-makers while also not assuming they know everything about a new idea [00:22:24]. Test your proposal with various people to find the right balance of information [00:23:02].
*   **Scope Creep:** Be wary of the project expanding to include too many unrelated elements, making it unrecognizable [00:23:20]. Also, guard against the project being stripped of its core innovative elements, rendering it ineffective [00:23:42].

## Addressing Uncertainty and Rejection

### Writing Convincing Proposals Despite Uncertainty

Since the impact of [[innovation_strategies | innovation]] is uncertain, proposals can be challenging to write [00:14:43]. Strategies include:
*   **Highlighting Current Costs:** Emphasize that maintaining the status quo is not cost-neutral [00:15:03].
*   **Leveraging External Examples:** Find examples where similar initiatives have been implemented elsewhere, providing data on costs and parameters [00:15:20].
*   **Building a Story:** Craft a compelling narrative that emphasizes why the idea matters, potentially making procedural concerns less relevant, especially with political or senior leadership commitment [00:16:01].

### What to Do After Rejection

If a proposal is rejected, even when you strongly believe in it:
*   **Wait for the Right Time:** Sometimes, it's simply the wrong context [00:16:54].
*   **Reframe the Idea:** Adapt your idea to better suit the current context or political signals [00:17:00].
*   **Build a Coalition:** Bring others along to support the idea and make the case for its importance [00:17:20].
*   **Seek Outside Voices/Stakeholders:** Enlist external supporters who appreciate the initiative and can advocate for it [00:17:40].
*   **Think Laterally:** Explore alternative approaches or workarounds [00:18:00].
*   **Recognize When to Wait:** Sometimes, you must accept that it's not going to happen and wait for a different context [00:18:06].
*   **Develop Personal Strategies:** Set personal limits (e.g., a "rule of three") for how many times you will push an idea [00:33:44].
*   **Seek Feedback:** Ask decision-makers why the idea didn't resonate or what insights you might be missing [00:34:26].
*   **Find Other Sponsors:** If your direct management is too busy, seek support from other sponsors, though this carries its own risks [00:34:50].

### Communicating Failure

In the public sector, discussing failure is often avoided [00:36:06]. However, it's important to reframe "failure" by:
*   **Limiting Exposure:** Starting small and testing ideas limits the impact if they don't work, allowing for learning [00:36:15].
*   **Multiple Goals:** Recognize that learning is a valid goal, especially in high-uncertainty situations where outcomes are unknown [00:36:56].
*   **Nuancing Success and Failure:** Understand that success and failure can be wafer-thin and often depend on external factors [00:37:29]. There are many shades of both, and a project might contribute value even if its primary goal isn't met [00:39:13].
*   **Delivering Something:** Aim for multiple payoffs from every effort to avoid the perception of complete failure [00:39:43].

## Getting Started

To get started with [[developing_new_ideas | developing new ideas]] and proposals, particularly in the public sector:
*   **Low-Fidelity Testing and Prototyping:** Conduct early, low-cost tests to scope elements and gather information [00:25:02]. This could involve wireframes for a website, role-playing service interactions, or even using duct tape and paper to test a product's display [00:25:20].
*   **Know Your Context:** Understand that the context for [[innovation_strategies | innovation]] varies significantly across different regions or agencies [00:26:54].
*   **Start Small with Limited Risk:** Begin with experiments that have minimal or no risk [00:27:17]. This strengthens your eventual proposal and allows you to gain experience without putting your organization at risk [00:27:53].
*   **Leverage Personal Discretion:** Identify what you can do differently within your own job context without needing permission [00:28:49]. Running small experiments builds confidence and comfort with pushing new ideas [00:29:02].
*   **Build Confidence:** People are more likely to support ideas from confident individuals [00:29:25]. Start small, involve colleagues, or even people outside of work to develop your ideas and build this confidence [00:29:36].

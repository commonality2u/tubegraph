## Introduction
[[Enhancement-oriented innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]] (EOI) focuses on gradual, incremental improvements within existing systems rather than disruptive changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is concerned with the further development of public services to increase public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This type of innovation is one of the most common and widespread in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, playing a strategic role in achieving public sector goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) at the OECD works on various [[innovation strategies | types of innovation]], including [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]], [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]], [[anticipatory_innovation | anticipatory innovation]], and [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. EOI is crucial because successful innovations and public service developments often culminate in enhancement-oriented activities, aiming to make current processes and systems as efficient and effective as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Characteristics of Enhancement-Oriented Innovation
[[Enhancement-oriented innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]] is characterized by:
*   **Upgrading practices**: It aims to improve existing methods and procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Achieving efficiencies and better results**: The focus is on optimizing performance within the current framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Building on existing structures**: It doesn't fundamentally challenge the status quo, but rather improves upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Gradual and incremental improvements**: As opposed to disruptive leaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Creating room for other innovations**: By saving time for public sector officials, EOI enables investment in other types of innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

While often incremental, EOI can lead to "radically shifting" outcomes, particularly in digital transformation projects, where small upgrades can have fundamental effects on efficiency, effectiveness, and lead to new types of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Public Sector Productivity and EOI
Public sector productivity is a key concept linked to [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. It measures total outputs divided by total inputs, aiming for a "steeper angle" of productivity over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

### Key Drivers of Productivity Change
Three main drivers contribute to productivity change in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>:
1.  **Specialization and Professionalization**: Increasing specialized roles within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
2.  **Increasing Capital Intensity**: This is rapidly growing, especially with digitalization and robotic process automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
3.  **Embodied Technological Change**: External technology changes influence specialization and capital intensity, transforming public sector agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

These forces create significant internal potential for productivity gains and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Realizing these gains, however, depends on the capacity of society and clients to adopt the innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

### Measuring Public Sector Productivity
Historically, public sector productivity has been seen as stable due to difficulties in measuring outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. To measure it:
1.  **Focus on Core Mission Outputs**: Identify the key outputs of an agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.
2.  **Develop Unit Cost or Activity Accounting**: For core outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.
3.  **Define a Cost-Weighted Total Output Metric**: Using average costs or administrative costs to weight outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
4.  **Divide Total Outputs by Total Inputs**: This provides a measure of total factor productivity, which can be tracked as an index number over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.
5.  **Handle Quality Issues**: Especially in decentralized services like health or policing, adjust output metrics for quality variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

### Productivity vs. Efficiency
Productivity differs from efficiency in several ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>:
*   **Frequency**: Productivity should be addressed constantly, annually or quarterly, over a consistent long-term trend (5-15 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. Efficiency reviews are often ad hoc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.
*   **Focus**: Productivity focuses on substantive services and big issues like digitalization and AI adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>. Efficiency is usually about lowering costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.
*   **Scope**: The production frontier for public sector agencies is constantly expandable in productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. Efficiency tends to see it as fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>.
*   **Improvement**: Productivity improves through new services, new customers, increasing capital intensity, implementing innovations, and keeping staff numbers stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.
*   **Mantra**: For productivity, the mantra is "better quality for customers, simpler processes for staff, cheaper production for the agency" – all simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>. Efficiency often entails cutting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.

## Role of Behavioral Insights in EOI
Behavioral insights (BI) can significantly improve public sector effectiveness, especially for [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Most public policies involve human behavior, and behavioral science recognizes that humans are systematically biased and often irrational in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. BI aims to embed evidence from behavioral science to improve public policy by enhancing the effectiveness of traditional tools like information, regulation, and incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

### Examples of BI Application
*   **UK Tax Collection**: By adding a single sentence ("9 out of 10 people paid their tax on time") to tax letters, leveraging "social proof," the UK tax agency collected an extra £200 million in tax debt in one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. Similar results were seen in Guatemala, with over $300,000 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Australian Hospital Appointments**: Sending a simple reminder letter with a map reduced missed specialist appointments by 32% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>, leading to annual savings of $1.6 million and a 9:1 return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.

### Challenges in Applying BI
*   **Experimental Mindset**: Systematic experimental approaches can reveal undesirable outcomes, which can be a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.
*   **Subtraction Bias**: Humans tend to add elements to a system rather than subtracting things that are not working, underestimating the power of removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>.
*   **Status Quo Bias**: Once a service is established, challenging or modifying it becomes very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>.
*   **Lack of Scaling**: Successful experiments often fail to be scaled up or implemented broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.
*   **External Validity & Diminishing Returns**: An experiment working in one setting might not work in another, or its efficiency might reduce over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>.
*   **Commitment to Scale**: Stakeholders might adopt a "wait-and-see" approach, leading to insufficient investment in scaling successful innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>.
*   **Backfiring Effects**: What encourages positive behavior in one setting might reduce it in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>.

## Administrative Paradigms and EOI
Administrative paradigms define the core ideas, problems to be addressed, and solutions within which public administrations operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. They influence the type of innovation that takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

Historically, there has been a shift in paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>:
*   **Classical Public Administration**: Focus on maintaining order and providing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.
*   [[New Public Management|New Public Management]] (NPM): Emerged in the late 1970s/1980s, emphasizing increasing efficiency, cutting slack, public-private competition, deregulation, and performance measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. EOI under NPM focuses on cost-effectiveness, efficiency, value for money, and client focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.
*   [[New Public Governance|New Public Governance]] (NPG): Focuses on quality improvement and collaboration with civil society actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. EOI under NPG emphasizes co-creation of solutions with communities, accessing societal resources, and collaborations through networks and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.

Small, incremental steps in EOI can lead to gradual, transformative institutional change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>. Success factors for innovation in an NPG paradigm include trust of employees, collaborative teams, and inter-organizational unit cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>.

## Examples of Enhancement-Oriented Innovation

### Austrian Tax Administration: Finance Online
The Austrian tax administration has continuously developed over 250 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Their "Finance Online" portal is the most used government portal in Austria, serving approximately 5.4 million users (4.7 million individuals and 0.6 million companies) with around 70 million logins per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:32">[01:33:32]</a>.

*   **Evolution**: Launched in 1998 with limited functionality for tax advisors, it opened to all taxpayers in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>. Major facelifts occurred in 2005 and 2018, with a significant relaunch in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:30">[01:35:30]</a>.
*   **Principles of Relaunch (2020)**:
    *   **User-centricity**: Moved from a legal approach to a user-centric one, creating a "persona" (Manfred, a 45-year-old married man with two children, digitally savvy) to guide development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:41">[01:36:41]</a>.
    *   **Mobility**: Developed a responsive application for mobile devices, acknowledging that younger users primarily access services via smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:23">[01:37:23]</a>.

    *   **Integration**: Fully integrated into the existing tax IT landscape, with backend calculations and checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:05">[01:38:05]</a>.
*   **Goals of Relaunch**: Reduce physical contacts in tax offices, increase online usage, reduce user errors, speed up processes, and increase the popularity of Finance Online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:54">[01:38:54]</a>.
*   **Development Process**: Involved crowdsourcing ideas, workshops with users and experts, and continuous user involvement through pilots and prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:29">[01:39:29]</a>.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   **Overview Page**: Provides clearly presented information and functions, eliminating the need for extensive menu navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>.
    *   **Tax Return Assistant**: Uses simple yes/no questions to compile individual tax returns, displaying only relevant input fields (often fewer than 10 for many users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:56">[01:41:56]</a>.
    *   **New Mailbox & Push Notifications**: For changes in tax return status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:30">[01:42:30]</a>.

### Chatbot Fred (Austrian Tax Administration)
Fred was launched in September 2019 to reduce phone calls and face-to-face contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:43">[01:42:43]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Received positive feedback and high usage without advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>.
*   **Live Chat Integration**: Less than 5% of cases require a human contact via live chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:25">[01:43:25]</a>.
*   **Editorial Team**: A team of 25 civil servants trains Fred on new topics, continuously improving its answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:50">[01:43:50]</a>.
*   **Future Plans**: Include identity verification via Finance Online for personalized information, filling out simple forms, and collaborations with other public administration bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:08">[01:44:08]</a>.

### City of Vienna: Quality Management and Smart City
Vienna emphasizes a holistic approach to public services and citizen needs, focusing on quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>.
*   **Tradition**: Long tradition of municipal housing providing affordable living and "one-stop shops" (municipal district offices) for close citizen interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>.
*   **Mindset Shift**: Transformed from a classic administration maintaining order to a "facilitator" role, developing the city's future together with citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. This required an intertwined change of mindset within the administration and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Partnership Administration**: This approach enabled a suitable pace for development, allowing staff and citizens to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>.
*   **COVID-19 Response**: Pre-existing services, trust, and partnership enabled providing timely information and guidance during the pandemic, using virtual government websites and the "Vienna bot" (a machine man communication device) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>.
*   **Core Principles**: Organizational and societal culture, open and active communication, transparency, and participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:12">[01:23:12]</a>.
*   **Common Assessment Framework (CAF)**: A 20-year-old tool designed by EU public administration experts specifically for [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:54">[01:24:54]</a>. It guides modern public administration and cultural change through:
    *   Continuous improvement (PDCA cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>.
    *   Learning organization principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:49">[01:25:49]</a>.
    *   Self-assessment, leveraging internal expertise and external partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>.
    *   Principles of excellence and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.
*   **Impact**: Achieved "facilitator" status, with continuous self-development and citizen engagement, exemplified by the "Smart City Vienna" initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:12">[01:27:12]</a>.

### Other Noted Examples
*   **Telemedicine**: Despite efficiency and effectiveness gains being known for over 20 years, rapid adoption only occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:43">[01:28:43]</a>.
*   **UK Taxation vs. Social Security Productivity**: The UK tax agency saw over 40% productivity increase by moving self-assessment and company taxes online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:33">[01:25:33]</a>. Conversely, a large reorganization in social security, moving to a telephone-based system, led to a sharp productivity decline, only recovering after a decade-long shift towards a fully digital model proved successful during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   **UK Passport Issuing & Driver Vehicle Licensing**: UK passport issuing maintained static productivity despite increased volume, as it built the basis for digital passports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:20">[01:29:20]</a>. UK driver vehicle licensing saw a 35% productivity slump over a decade due to an imperfect digitalization scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:26">[01:30:26]</a>.
*   **Singapore Digital Platforms**: Increased efficiency and laid the foundation for new services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:30">[01:43:30]</a>.
*   **Portugal**: Examples of streamlining different services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
*   **Australia**: Examples of influencing stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Challenges and Key Considerations for EOI
*   **Mindset Issues**: Resistance to change, often expressed as "we've always done it this way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:10">[01:46:10]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Measuring Outputs**: A key historical barrier to recognizing public sector productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide**: Concerns that digitizing services might exacerbate existing inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:45">[01:51:45]</a>.
*   **Legacy and Zombie Technologies**: Managing big projects in the long run and transitioning away from obsolete technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:08">[01:52:08]</a>.
*   **Lack of Resources and BI Knowledge**: Insufficient tools and understanding within government to effectively apply behavioral insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:27">[01:49:27]</a>.
*   **Alignment with Stakeholders**: Ensuring initiatives are well-aligned with end-users and decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:42">[01:49:42]</a>.
*   **Sharing Failures**: A key challenge is being transparent about what didn't work, which can be immensely useful for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:23">[01:50:23]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[Enhancement-oriented innovation | Enhancement-oriented innovation]] is foundational to public sector development, enabling the public sector to provide value for money and perform work efficiently and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. While often incremental, EOI can lead to significant, even radical, transformations within systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. A systematic measurement of productivity, alongside an experimental mindset that is open to learning from failures, is crucial for driving EOI. Furthermore, adapting to future challenges requires educating public managers to instill a mindset of continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>.

Improving [[public_trust_and_governance | government transparency]] and [[public_trust_and_governance | accountability]] is a crucial goal for public administration, heavily influenced by new approaches like "rules as code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) acts as a source of [[trust_and_transparency_in_public_governance | trust and advice]] for governments to adopt a more deliberate and consistent approach to public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Rules as Code: A Foundation for Transparency
Rules as code involves creating an official, machine-consumable version of rules that goes beyond traditional natural language communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This approach allows computer systems to understand and act on rules consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

This concept is seen as a strategic, deliberate, and systemic approach where machine-consumable rules are conceived and created from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. By doing so, it changes *when*, *what*, *why*, *how*, and *for whom* rules are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

### Benefits for Transparency and Accountability
*   **Enhanced Understanding**: Rules as code makes it easier for people to understand their rights and obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This includes enabling citizens to better understand their entitlements to benefits or obligations for paying taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Improved Compliance**: It can significantly improve compliance with rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Policy Modeling**: Rules as code enables greater excellence in policy modeling by government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This means better understanding the impact of potential law changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a> and making policies more readable and predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   **Closing the Implementation Gap**: Historically, a "translation gap" exists between legislation and its ground-level implementation, often leading to misinterpretations, inconsistencies, and unfair outcomes, such as mispaying people due to spreadsheet errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. Rules as code, by providing an authoritative API for prescriptive rules, helps bridge this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Traceability and Auditing**: Being able to capture the specific law a decision was based on, along with included data points, dramatically improves traceability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. This allows for easier appeal of decisions and auditing of government processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>.
*   **Fairness**: The misconception that machines making decisions will lead to less fairness is addressed by recognizing that current systems already have machines making unfair decisions due to lack of traceability to the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Rules as code aims to correct this by ensuring full explainability and access to justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.
*   **Addressing Information Asymmetry**: In government, especially during budget bill debates, there can be an asymmetry of information where structural means of understanding the impact of laws primarily rely on the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. Publishing hypotheses in code alongside budget and social security bills allows for greater scrutiny of algorithms and hypotheses, opening them to public consultation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.
*   **Multi-disciplinary Approach**: Effective policy making requires multi-disciplinary teams including policy people, legislators, service designers, technologists, and end-users to test and implement policies rapidly and iteratively, ensuring they suit their purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook
Despite the promise, rules as code is still in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>. Key challenges include:
*   **Legitimacy of Interdisciplinary Teams**: The need to bring legislative drafters and coders to the same table is a fundamental challenge in [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.
*   **Starting Small**: Governments should find specific areas with clear needs for rules as code, such as those undergoing massive changes or aiming to improve service delivery, and start with small, iterative prototypes driven by use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Technocratic Fantasy**: The goal is not to automate everything or disturb mediation, but to improve the quality of [[seamless_government_practices_and_challenges | public service delivery]] by freeing civil servants from easy-to-automate tasks to focus on complex cases requiring human intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.
*   **Harnessing Civil Society Intelligence**: There is a lot of intelligence outside government that can contribute to rule-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>. Allowing citizens and other agencies to participate, for example by scrutinizing policies and algorithms, and proposing amendments, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>.
*   **Open Source Existing Code**: Many government systems already contain coded rules that are not scrutable or auditable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>. A significant effort should focus on opening these systems through open source practices and fostering a governance model that allows collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>.

Ultimately, rules as code is not just a technocratic idea, but a fundamental shift in [[feedback_and_improvements_in_public_administration_using_caf | public administration]] that impacts how we engage with people and machines, vital for the [[digital transformation in government | future of government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. It contributes to building a resilient, effective, and responsive public sector capable of serving citizens in an increasingly complex and rapidly changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>.

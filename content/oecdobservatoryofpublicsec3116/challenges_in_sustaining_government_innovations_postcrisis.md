The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical need for more innovative and agile government, underscoring that public governance matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The immediate crisis response has laid the groundwork for the government of the future, emphasizing the importance of learning quickly in unprecedented situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Innovation During Crisis: A Double-Edged Sword

The crisis made innovation easier in some ways, but harder in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

### Facilitators of Innovation
*   **Clear Need for Change**: An overriding message that change is necessary makes [[Challenges in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] clearly needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.
*   **New Options Given Parity**: The bias towards existing options disappears when they are inadequate or insufficient for the new context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.
*   **Investment and Support**: New ways of working are supported and invested in, sometimes at great scale and pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
*   **Normalization of Novelty**: Doing something unusual becomes perfectly normal, making it strange to stick to previous norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
*   **Increased Legitimacy**: The crisis demonstrated that [[Challenges in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] is a necessity, not a luxury, increasing its legitimacy in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.
*   **Quantum Leap in Digital Transformation**: Existing digital infrastructure allowed for rapid scaling of capacity, leading to a major disruption in digital work habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
*   **Problem-Solving Focus**: People realize [[Challenges in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] is the only way to deal with the crisis, leading to more individuals innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.
*   **Crisis as a "Laboratory"**: The crisis acts as a huge laboratory for testing new things, improving solutions, and showing the potential of [[Challenges in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] in bringing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.
*   **Revelation of Innovation Ecosystems**: The crisis confirmed that an [[Challenges in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] ecosystem, with its sometimes latent or invisible connections, is real and can facilitate sharing economies, crowdsourcing, and skills transference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.
*   **Trust in Government**: The crisis offered an opportunity to build new trust in government in many countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.
*   **Breaking Barriers**: Barriers that were previously difficult to overcome between government departments and civic tech movements were broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.
*   **Professional Expertise**: Investing in the ability of professionals, such as medical staff, to innovate within their fields is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>.

### Hindrances to Innovation
*   **Centralization of Decision-Making**: Crisis mode often centralizes decision-making at the top of the hierarchy, potentially distancing solutions from specific frontline knowledge and possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.
*   **Prioritization Shift**: Innovation work not directly related to the crisis may take a back burner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.
*   **Siloing**: Specialists may close ranks, leading to a silification of innovation where solutions in one sector (e.g., health) may not synchronize with others (e.g., social services, policing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.
*   **Competency Gaps**: Issues with the competency in using more appropriate tools, especially at the organizational level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>.
*   **"Presentism" and Tunnel Vision**: An initial hijacking by urgency creates a "tunnel effect," where people are so concentrated on immediate, pragmatic solutions that they ignore other ongoing crises or long-term implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.
*   **Nostalgia for Normality**: A "nostalgia of normality" exists, with some wishing to return to the world as it was, despite prior efforts to change that "normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.
*   **Blame Game and Wishful Thinking**: A "blame game" can hinder rational arguments, and "wishful thinking" expects the crisis to solve all problems magically, ignoring the need for continuous experimentation and learning from errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.
*   **Information Overload and Misinformation**: Dealing with a plethoric, dispersed, and sometimes unreliable quantity of information circulating through various channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.
*   **Rushed and Atomized Initiatives**: The risk of voluntaristic, rushed, or atomized initiatives that replicate without dialogue or coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.
*   **Digital Divide**: The virtualization of public services can create new problems, especially if it magnifies existing inequalities (e.g., for populations without internet access) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.
*   **Employee Well-being**: Remote work, while enabling, can also create issues like loneliness for public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.

## Sustaining Innovation Post-Crisis

### Timeframes for Response
Governments must operate across different timeframes: immediate, recovery, and longer term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.
1.  **Emerging Crisis**: Focus on traditional health and safety preparation, with politicians involved in lockdown decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.
2.  **Crisis Mode**: Initially, it's about innovative health and societal solutions with highly centralized decisions. Later, there's an "everyday living" with the crisis, as new ways of working become routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>.
3.  **Post-Crisis World (Adaptation & Change)**: This phase involves figuring out which parts of the "new normal" and "old normal" will fit into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">[00:56:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. This period is estimated to last between 9 and 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.
4.  **New Reality**: A shift into a new reality where significant, more radical changes from the crisis are integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.

### Strategies for Sustainability
*   **Push for a New Normal**: Instead of returning to the "old normal," efforts should focus on building a "new normal" that addresses pre-existing challenges more urgently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.
*   **Strategic Engagement**: Actively engage in discussions about the new reality now, as people have the mental space for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.
*   **Empower Innovative Leaders**: Leaders can push for sustained change by involving users and employing tools like design thinking to understand and meet evolving needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.
*   **Systemic Learning**: Connect different parts of the system that want to learn and make it legitimate to question what needs to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>.
*   **Capture and Emphasize Success Stories**: Document and highlight positive examples of new ways of working to showcase the benefits of the "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>.
*   **Evidence-Based Decision-Making**: Stop guessing what the new normal will be and instead use evidence-based processes, triangulating qualitative and quantitative data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>.
*   **Reinvest in the Innovation Ecosystem**: Continue to support and engage with the [[Challenges in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] ecosystem, ensuring bidirectional collaboration between public administration and external stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:20">[01:04:20]</a>.
*   **Focus on Use and Sustainability**: The issue is not just creating outputs but ensuring their actual use and sustainability. Analyze why good innovations might not be used and plan for long-term management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.
*   **Responsible Innovation**: Think about the consequences of [[Challenges in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]], anticipating desirable outcomes and preparing for unintended ones through foresight and anticipatory methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>.
*   **Embrace Experimentation**: View [[Challenges in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] as experimentation, allowing for testing, learning from failures, improving, and reducing risk before large-scale implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:29">[01:06:29]</a>.
*   **Socialize Innovation**: Make innovations accessible, spread their knowledge, and demonstrate their efficiency to make them more durable and widely adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>.
*   **Re-evaluate Values**: Use the crisis as an opportunity to re-evaluate values that can drive systemic change, moving towards a more socially active way of managing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   **Rethink Planning Processes**: Recognize that normal planning processes are insufficient for dealing with recurring crises. Embrace scenario planning (short, medium, long-term) and anticipatory governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

### The Role of Public Servants
The crisis has been an intense training ground for public servants, revealing their extraordinary capacity for adaptation and providing answers to unprecedented challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>. This capacity was built on a long, silent, and gradual accumulation of small changes and continuous efforts in [[Challenges in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:35">[01:17:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12">[01:18:12]</a>.

The experience has fostered a "collective resonance" among people and public servants, showing an impressive capacity to engage and work on front lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>. Sustaining this requires engaging public servants' experiences to transition from a transitory collective experience to a continuous, participatory state in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:05">[01:20:05]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to shift from "innovation theater" to hands-on practice, preparing public servants to innovate in all sorts of crises, including those like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:52">[01:27:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

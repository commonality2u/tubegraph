Building successful [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]] presents a variety of complex challenges, often requiring a nuanced approach to balance diverse interests and foster genuine cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the Investment and Development Agency of Latvia (LIAA) are actively working to test and develop approaches for creating anticipatory [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Understanding [[Innovation Ecosystems]]

[[Innovation_ecosystems | Innovation ecosystems]] are complex systems fundamentally characterized by interactions between diverse actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Their behavior is emergent, non-linear, and unpredictable, with resilience stemming from the diversity of actors and their interactions, as well as the flows of information and resources between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Historically, innovation has been often misunderstood as a linear process, relying on one-way technology transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. However, it is increasingly recognized that innovation is facilitated by the interweaving of relationships among a diverse set of actors with varied interests and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Key [[Challenges in implementing innovation]]

Governments and agencies face significant [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation | challenges in implementing innovation]] within these complex structures.

### Stakeholder Engagement and Skepticism
A primary [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation_in_the_public_sector | challenge in implementing innovation in the public sector]] is overcoming initial skepticism from industry stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Companies often lack spare time and are focused on their own projects, making them wary of new initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The concept of [[innovation_ecosystems | ecosystems]] can also be perceived as too abstract for many collaborators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

### Defining Purpose and Outcomes
While a shared vision is crucial, defining clear, concrete goals and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for all stakeholders is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. There is a need to identify very realistic gains for all involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, showing both individual and community benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. A common pitfall is biasing outcomes towards innovation metrics or economic growth, rather than focusing on how [[innovation_ecosystems | ecosystems]] function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Orchestration vs. Ordering
Confusing orchestration with ordering can lead to focusing on attracting the wrong types or too much of a certain input, unbalancing the [[innovation_ecosystems | ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. If left totally floating without leadership, it is harder to drive the process forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

### The Time Horizon of Change
Systemic innovation, particularly when aiming to develop entirely new systems, tends to be a meandering process that takes a long time, often 30 or 40 years for significant transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. For many pressing social challenges, such as aging, care, education, or work, the desired "destination" is not clear; it must be discovered through an exploratory, emergent process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

## Strategies for Overcoming Challenges / [[Skills and Approaches for Innovation Ecosystems]]

Successfully building and orchestrating [[innovation_ecosystems | innovation ecosystems]] requires specific [[skills_and_approaches_for_innovation_ecosystems | skills and approaches for innovation ecosystems]].

### Building Trust and Relationships
Trust among stakeholders and, critically, trust in the coordinators, is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. Coordinators must deliver on their promises to avoid losing stakeholder trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. While purpose is often emphasized, starting with building relationships is crucial because new relationships, particularly more equal ones, can shift power dynamics and allow for the development of new purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

### Clear Communication and Practicality
The team orchestrating the [[innovation_ecosystems | ecosystem]] needs enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> and the ability to emphasize practical aspects over abstract concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Explaining things simply and identifying realistic, individual gains for stakeholders is key to engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Effective communication is also vital for inspiring wider networks and achieving broader societal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

### Understanding Stakeholder Maturity
It is crucial to assess the maturity levels of stakeholders, as companies in different life cycles will have different aims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Aligning incentives towards a shared purpose and encouraging self-regeneration (autopoiesis) are critical for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Intentional Orchestration and Support
A good understanding of the groundwork and preconditions in the local region is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. The ability to bring together key decision-makers and "movers and shakers" who can drive the agenda forward is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Rather than a purely emergent process, there is a need for "intentional emergence," deliberately synchronizing, complementing, and coordinating multiple commitments from various actors like policymakers, investors, and consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Context is everything, and different interventions are required for [[innovation_ecosystems | ecosystems]] at various stages of their life cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Ultimately, delivering some sort of results early on helps avoid the perception of being merely a "talking shop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

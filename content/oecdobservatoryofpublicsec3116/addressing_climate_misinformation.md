Governments and international organizations are increasingly recognizing the critical role of behavioral science in tackling the spread of [[misinformation_and_disinformation | climate misinformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:49">[:01:33:49]</a>. This effort is a key component of the broader commitment to supporting governments in tackling [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[:00:00:21]</a> and achieving a rapid, just, and resilient transition to Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[:00:05:45]</a>.

## The Challenge of Misinformation

The spread of [[misinformation_and_disinformation | misinformation]] related to [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate change]] is a significant global concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:4:02">[:01:4:02]</a>. There is a "huge epistemological crisis" where social groups interpret the same facts differently, making true deliberative processes difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:01">[:01:49:01]</a>. Misinformation was identified as a top worry in a recent World Elite Worry List, showing growing recognition of its impact on democracy and global peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[:01:49:51]</a>.

This challenge is exacerbated by a "trust crisis" in governments and public institutions, with recent OECD surveys indicating low levels of public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:3:33">[:01:3:33]</a>. Despite citizens expecting governments to prioritize reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting the green transition, only 42% are confident their country will achieve these goals within the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[:01:11:02]</a>. This "trust gap" highlights the importance of effective communication and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:3:33">[:01:3:33]</a>.

## Behavioral Science in Combating Misinformation

[[behavioral_science_in_combating_misinformation | Behavioral science]] is being leveraged to understand people's susceptibility to misinformation and the factors driving its spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[:01:34:01]</a>. It also helps to develop strategies to counter its impact and strengthen democratic resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:13">[:01:34:13]</a>. The OECD's "Mind Shift Green Lift: Six Behavioral Science Trends for Environmental Policy" report highlights this as one of its key trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[:01:15:55]</a>.

### Canada's PARCA Initiative

The Program of Applied Research on Climate Action (PARCA) in Canada exemplifies how governments are using [[behavioral_science_in_combating_misinformation | behavioral science]] to counter [[misinformation_and_disinformation | climate misinformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:28">[:01:34:28]</a>. The PARCA team conducts national surveys and in-depth studies to assess the Canadian public's susceptibility to climate-related misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:44">[:01:34:44]</a>.

The aim of these efforts is to:
*   Understand how people think, feel, and act when confronted with misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:57">[:01:34:57]</a>.
*   Identify the most harmful types of misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[:01:35:10]</a>.
*   Develop effective strategies to counter its spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:16">[:01:35:16]</a>.

In 2024, PARCA conducted a randomized control trial to test several behaviorally informed interventions aimed at boosting resilience to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:26">[:01:35:26]</a>. These interventions focused on:
*   Encouraging individuals to assess the accuracy of information they encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:41">[:01:35:41]</a>.
*   Strengthening [[digital_media_literacy_and_misinformation | digital media literacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[:01:35:50]</a>.
*   Preemptive refutation, such as actively correcting common false claims related to [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:52">[:01:35:52]</a>.

The results showed that interventions focusing on enhancing [[digital_media_literacy and misinformation | digital media literacy]] and providing active preemptive refutations of false claims were the most effective in reducing susceptibility to misinformation and decreasing the spread of false news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:02">[:01:36:02]</a>. However, interventions that only provided passive information on how to find misinformation and assess accuracy made people more skeptical and less accurate in identifying true headlines, suggesting unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:21">[:01:36:21]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Future Directions

The work on combating misinformation is part of a larger multi-disciplinary project at the OECD called Net Zero plus, which aims to create a comprehensive narrative on [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate change]] to deliver a rapid, just, and resilient transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[:00:05:29]</a>. This includes exploring the role of the government-citizen interface in driving climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[:00:06:45]</a>, drawing on long-standing work on [[government_and_media_trust_in_misinformation_contexts | trusting government]], citizen participation, public communication, and [[behavioral_science_in_combating_misinformation | behavioral science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[:00:06:56]</a>.

The OECD is uniquely positioned to lead this work due to its broad reach across policy communities and its commitment to advancing [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science approaches]] in the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[:00:08:00]</a>. The "Mind Shift Green Lift" paper offers a roadmap for policymakers to integrate [[behavioral_science_in_combating_misinformation | behavioral science]] into environmental policy shaping and to engage citizens to promote sustainable behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[:00:08:23]</a>.

To move from insights to action, governments are encouraged to:
*   Strengthen decision-making within governments themselves by integrating [[behavioral_science_in_combating_misinformation | behavioral science]] to reduce biases and improve effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[:00:39:19]</a>.
*   Engage citizens as active participants by reducing barriers to participation, building trust, and aligning policies with public expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[:00:38:55]</a>.
*   Counteract [[misinformation_and_disinformation | misinformation and disinformation]] related to [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:3:56">[:01:3:56]</a>.

However, it is crucial to remember that [[behavioral_science_in_combating_misinformation | behavioral science]] is not a "silver bullet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[:00:40:15]</a>. While behavioral change is important, it is only one piece of a broader strategy that also requires technology and systemic changes for meaningful progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[:00:40:20]</a>. Effective strategies require continuous learning, adaptation, and the ability to detect and counter "dark nudges" or "dark patterns" that manipulate people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:18">[:01:54:18]</a>. The focus must be on fostering trust in experts and leaders through honesty and transparency in research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:25">[:01:53:25]</a>.

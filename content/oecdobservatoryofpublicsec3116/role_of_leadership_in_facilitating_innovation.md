## The Influence of Leadership on Innovation Portfolios

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) began examining innovation portfolios because, in general, governments tend to have a layered approach to policy and innovation projects, often without a systematic overview of their combined outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Within this context, [[role_of_leadership_in_fostering_innovation | leadership innovation]] communities are identified as key users who could benefit from a portfolio assessment tool to understand their organization's innovation landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

Organizations often have specific tools, methods, cultures, rules, procurement procedures, and [[Role of Leadership in Innovation | leadership]] approaches that inherently reward certain types of innovation while discouraging others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. This internal structuring significantly shapes an organization's actual innovation portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Desired Leadership Qualities for Innovation

Effective innovation portfolio management, particularly for fostering experimentation and portfolio visualization, requires a specific kind of [[Role of Leadership in Innovation | leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

> "There is something about leadership quality that that's required to work in a slightly different way and to kind of let go of the assumption that you're going to know the right answer to let go of the assumption that you when the right answer is found that you should be the person that finds it and giving I think space for for others and for diversity perspective and I think there is I think there is quite a personal or behavioral trait around being able to being able to sit in the uncomfortable be uncomfortable uncertainty and I think that's I think that's not to be underestimated in terms of what we ask people to when they when we ask them to work in different ways and step outside our comfort zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>

This suggests a shift from traditional, expert-driven [[Role of Leadership in Innovation | leadership]] to a more adaptive and collaborative model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>:
*   **Enabling Transformation** [[Role of Leadership in Innovation | leadership]] should focus on enabling transformation rather than merely executing plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Approach** It involves leaders collaborating to achieve desired transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>.
*   **Systems Leadership** This emerging type of [[Role of Leadership in Innovation | leadership]] allows different individuals within a system to take the lead on various issues, enabling the entire system to achieve broader outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.
*   **Comfort with Uncertainty** Leaders need to be comfortable with uncertainty, letting go of the need to always have the right answer or be the one to find it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>.
*   **Valuing Diverse Perspectives** Creating space for diverse perspectives and voices is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:32">[01:21:32]</a>.

## Navigating Organizational Change

When addressing [[challenges_of_organizational_change_for_innovation | challenges of organizational change for innovation]] and power dynamics, it's important to:
*   **Acknowledge and Engage Power Structures**: Rather than bypassing powerful actors or institutions with vested interests, they should be acknowledged and included as part of the necessary consortium to drive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>.
*   **Open Up Processes**: Creating open structures for projects, perhaps by centering them around real-world "objects" (like a "street") instead of traditional organizational silos, can bring diverse stakeholders (e.g., car companies, landscape designers, school kids) into the same conversation, fostering a more democratic and transparent process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:46">[01:12:46]</a>.
*   **Start with the "Coalition of the Willing"**: Radical organizational change can be met with immediate resistance. It's often more effective to begin by gathering people and silos already supportive of the process, both internally and externally, to build momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Sense-Making and Problem Framing**: Organizational solutions should not precede the definition of problems. Sense-making, problem framing, and portfolio framing, along with coalition building, should come first, with organizational changes following organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.
*   **Foster Continuous Organizing and Learning**: Instead of viewing an organization as static, it should be seen as a dynamic entity that constantly adapts based on new learnings and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. Projects can be used to sketch out what the organization *might be*, rather than assuming a fixed structure from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:07">[01:18:07]</a>.

A portfolio approach to innovation should be possible under any kind of [[Role of Leadership in Innovation | leadership]], as processes need to be built in the public sector that are less dependent on individual "hero leaders" who come and go. This makes the approach more inclusive and resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.

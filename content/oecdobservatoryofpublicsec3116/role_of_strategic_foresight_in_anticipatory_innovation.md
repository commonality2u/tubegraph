This article explores the concept of [[Anticipatory Innovation]], highlighting the crucial role of [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]] in its implementation within the public sector. It draws insights from discussions at a webinar hosted by the OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Defining [[Anticipatory Innovation]]

[[Anticipatory Innovation]] is a key facet of OPSI's multi-faceted innovation model for the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It is systematically under-invested in, making it an area of focus for OPSI to build capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The distinction is made between anticipation, [[Anticipatory Innovation]], and anticipatory innovation governance, emphasizing that it's not enough to merely anticipate or innovate; mechanisms and structures must be in place within governments to enable this work sustainably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Anticipatory innovation governance mechanisms aim to create an authorizing environment and agency for this work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The goal is to move beyond good intentions and achieve action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Initiatives and Collaborations

OPSI conducts its work through cases and action research, collaborating with governments to build up [[Anticipatory Innovation]] capacity and learn what it takes to do this work well in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### The [[Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit]]

A significant initiative is the development of an [[Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit]] in collaboration with LabX Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> and the Danish Design Center for an international version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. This project is part of an incubator program in collaboration with the European Union's Horizon 2020 programme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

#### LabX Portugal's Approach
LabX Portugal aims to translate [[Anticipatory Innovation]] concepts into actions that tackle real needs in public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Their process involves:
*   **Crowdsourcing problems:** Identifying problems from the standpoint of potential users, not just experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Identifying major issues:**
    *   Uneasiness with future uncertainty: People avoid thinking about it or try to repress it through prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   Sense of urgency: Constantly dealing with day-to-day issues, neglecting future horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   Reliance on past routines: Perpetuating solutions that are no longer effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
    *   Helplessness and feeble interest/skills: Managers feel alone in practical implementation, and new practitioners lack interest/skills due to a lack of exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Designing principles for the starter kit:**
    *   Based on solving real problems and translating them into challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   Empowering users without creating new dependencies, fostering self-capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
    *   User-friendly, supporting a "do-it-yourself" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
    *   Actionable and adaptable, leading to real changes and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Kit architecture:** Starting with problems, translating them into challenges (e.g., imagining alternative futures, envisioning a new vision, setting strategy, understanding drivers of change), and providing different tools for each challenge area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Goals of the incubator program:** Raise awareness, generate interest, engage users in practical tasks, and bridge the gap between knowledge and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Experimental approach:** Testing the starter kit and learning from attrition to improve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

#### Country Contexts
*   **Chile:** Recently established Ministry of Science, Knowledge, Technology, and Innovation, which published its first national policy in October 2020. This policy established [[Anticipatory Innovation]] as a central area, forming one-third of the country's priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. The challenge is that existing initiatives are not organized as a system, lacking political agreement, funding, and multidisciplinary technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
*   **Denmark:** Has a long history of public sector innovation, with 8 out of 10 public workplaces implementing innovation in the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. Innovation is often bottom-up and close to citizens, focusing on enhancement and adaptive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. However, [[Anticipatory Innovation]] and mission-oriented innovation are identified as weaker spots, needing continuous development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
*   **Slovenia:** Initiated a study on age and talent management with OPSI, driven by demographic changes (33% of Slovenians over 65 by 2050) and the need for an efficient talent management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>. Their approach is learning by doing, using concrete cases to engage civil servants and prove the value of new practices to leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.

## Challenges and Barriers to Implementing [[Anticipatory Innovation]]

Josh Pulchar, [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]] lead at OPSI, outlines five broad categories of barriers, responsible for an "impact gap" where excellent foresight work doesn't get implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>:

*   **Competency Barriers:** [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | Strategic foresight]] practice is not systematically embedded across governments, often existing only in pockets of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.
*   **Cultural Barriers:** Unreasonable expectations that [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]] will act like an oracle, revealing the future and solving all problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Barriers:** Difficulties in comprehending complexity, uncertainty, and exponentiality, leading to avoidance, groupthink, recency/availability bias, and a lack of imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>.
*   **Corporate Barriers:** Organizations holding onto implicit "zombie futures" â€“ outdated versions of the future that are no longer in step with a fast-changing reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
*   **Communication Barriers:** Different perceptions of the future within an organization, leading to implicit disagreements rather than constructive dialogue and shared narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.

## Key Needs for Civil Servants and Toolkit Design Principles

Civil servants wishing to embrace [[Anticipatory Innovation]] need:
*   **Motivation and soft skills:** Collaboration and co-creation are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.
*   **Supportive environment:** A system with embedded tools and processes that don't depend solely on individual willingness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.
*   **Practicality and tangibility:** Toolkits must be relevant to users and help solve concrete problems, not just remain abstract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.
*   **Clear connections:** Understanding how anticipatory tools connect to other innovation approaches and when they are the right tool to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.
*   **Accessibility:** Something that public managers can easily access and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.
*   **Socializing skills:** Stimulating abilities like imagination, boldness, and prospection within public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.
*   **Learning from the future:** Exploring alternatives, conceiving responsible innovation, and sustainable societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.

## Limitations and Expectations of Toolkits

While in demand, an [[Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit]] is not a panacea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>.
*   **Not a problem-solver on its own:** [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | Strategic foresight]] must lead to action and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.
*   **Enlarges, but doesn't complete the picture:** It cannot encompass all relevant considerations for decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Requires sustained effort:** Breakthroughs are rare in single exercises; benefits accrue over decades of consistent work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.
*   **Avoids excessive pondering:** Effective [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]] avoids mere information gathering; it prioritizes selection, purpose-driven sense-making, strategic reframing, and generating ideas for concrete innovation and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **Not a prescriptive solution:** The toolkit should be a modular and adaptable platform for asking questions, not providing all answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. Its purpose is to start a process of learning by doing and capacity building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.

## Addressing the Political Dimension and Values

[[Anticipatory Innovation]] work inherently affects public values due to the high uncertainty of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. Key challenges include:
*   **Political cycles vs. long-term problems:** Political cycles are typically 3-5 years, whereas major challenges require much longer time scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>.
*   **Incorporating values:** A crucial aspect is determining which future scenarios are considered opportunities and which are risks. This is a personal question requiring political agreement as a society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.
*   **Offering scenarios as a public good:** Providing diverse future scenarios to society (politicians, productive sector, academia) allows them to respond based on their own values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.
*   **Bridging thinking styles:** Challenging the dominance of linear economic thinking in future discussions with a more non-linear approach that focuses on desired futures and societal agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>.
*   **Communicating results and proving value:** Being motivated and "stubborn" in implementing solutions is crucial to spread belief in this new culture and gain leadership buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>. The challenge remains when politicians avoid transparency or make decisions without clear explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

The work on [[Anticipatory Innovation]] and [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]] generates excitement despite its inherent difficulties and intangible nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. Key elements for success include senior buy-in, funding, and an authorizing environment that fosters agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>. The continuous effort to embed anticipatory practices into governments is crucial for long-term benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.

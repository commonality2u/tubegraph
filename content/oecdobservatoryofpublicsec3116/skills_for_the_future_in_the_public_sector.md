The topic of skills for the future in the public sector is crucial for ensuring that public administrations can effectively identify and develop necessary capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The discussion centers on the future of work in public service and how central public administrations are preparing for a future that will be more digital, flexible, and full of surprises and crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Current State and Challenges

A poll conducted during a discussion on this topic revealed varied perspectives on public managers' readiness to adapt post-COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
*   50% believe public managers are willing to acknowledge lessons learned from the crisis but less willing to change their actions and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   28% are optimistic, believing managers are willing and ready to learn and adapt their management methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.
*   21% stated their management is eager to return to the old normal status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.

### Organizational Inertia and Resistance to Change
Cheryl Chung, from Singapore Futures, shared a less optimistic view, suggesting public managers might be less willing to change despite recognizing lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. She highlighted several factors contributing to [[agility_and_transformation_in_the_public_sector | organizational inertia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>:
*   **Precedent and Existing Policies**: A reliance on what has been done before and strict adherence to policy guidelines can hinder new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Competency and Culture**: Organizations tend to approach problems based on existing competencies. Bringing in new talent, like designers to a team of economists, can be challenging due to differing values and organizational culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Organizational Habits and Routines**: Fixed cycles for budgets, review periods, or even meeting schedules can constrain new ways of thinking and working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

### Opportunity from Crisis
Despite inertia, the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that public administration is not inherently non-flexible or non-resilient, providing an opportunity to renew its image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The crisis forced rapid digitalization and adaptation, showing that old ways of working are insufficient to keep up with fast changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.

## Future of Work and Talent Management

The future of work in public service demands a workforce equipped with the right skills and management structures to utilize those skills effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This largely revolves around [[resources_for_skills_and_capacity_building_in_public_service | talent management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Defining Talent
The definition of "talent" is rapidly shifting and changing, particularly coming out of the crisis where expectations on public service to deliver are higher than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It's crucial not only to identify needed skills and talent but also to integrate them through recruitment or development strategies, and critically, to know how to put them to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### The Evolving Workforce
*   **Future Jobs**: Many jobs that will exist in 2030 do not even exist yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Reskilling Needs**: Almost half of the current workforce will need to reskill in the next five years due to increasing technology adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Multi-generational Workforce**: Public services are increasingly multi-generational, requiring diverse approaches to talent management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Millennials**: The rise of millennials in the workforce brings different mentalities and demands for flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.
*   **Professional Diversity**: The public service is moving from a single "professional civil service" concept to a "civil service of professions," encompassing multiple backgrounds and professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

## Necessary Skills for the Future Public Sector

The public sector needs to focus on building strong foundational personal attributes and universally applicable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Key Skills Identified:
*   **Digital Skills**: Essential for adapting to new working models and improving services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.
*   **Soft Skills**:
    *   Critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>
    *   Creative problem solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>
    *   Teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>
    *   Empathy and care for each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>
    *   Adaptation to change and its management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>
    *   Communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>
    *   Self-leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>
    *   Effective meetings and public speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>
    *   Cross-department collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>

## Leadership and Management in the New Normal

The COVID-19 crisis has ushered in a "new normal" for public administration, demanding a shift from old working ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

### Shifting Management Culture
*   **Focus on Results**: Leaders must shift from process-driven to results-driven management, focusing on what to expect from people rather than micromanaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.
*   **Trust-Based Leadership**: Building trust is a crucial factor for achieving work results, especially with hybrid teams and remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. Countries with higher levels of trust in government were faster and more efficient in deploying crisis measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>.
*   **Enable Development**: Public administration's role is to enable the development of skills for public employees and provide necessary training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Distributed Leadership**: Questioning the centralized, top-down leadership model and exploring more distributed, bottom-up approaches, potentially involving "shadow boards" of younger people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
*   **Fostering [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_leadership | Innovation]]**: Leaders must create conditions for [[innovative_approaches_in_public_sector_organizations | innovation]], which used to happen informally (e.g., at coffee machines). This means recreating spaces for thinking and risk-taking, abandoning a "blame error" culture, and allowing for mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>.
*   **Psychological Safety**: Creating psychologically safe environments where staff can be themselves and speak up constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

## Learning and Development

Learning needs to move beyond traditional classroom settings to become a day-to-day activity embedded in careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

### Innovative Learning Tools and Experiences
*   **Anticipatory Planning**: Moving beyond planning the future based solely on past events, and instead focusing on anticipating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. This involves foresight and scenario planning, as demonstrated by the European Commission's "Future of Government" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.
*   **Experiential Learning**:
    *   **"Inequality Walk"**: An orientation walk (now adapted online) for students to train observational skills, empathy, and comfort with messy policy processes by experiencing real-world inequality firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.
    *   **Team-building Activities**: Informal social contacts and activities like cooking classes can foster team dynamics and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
*   **Competence Building**:
    *   **Nil Core (Technical Powerhouse)**: A system defining minimum standards for digital literacy and information security awareness for every employee, crucial in a hybrid world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.
    *   **Center of Excellence**: A one-stop knowledge sharing hub connecting HR and technical teams across different countries, supporting knowledge dissemination, management, and collaborative training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.
    *   **Meal Master Talk**: A program focused on practicing soft skills like effective communication, self-leadership, meeting effectiveness, public speaking, and cross-department collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.
*   **Digital Collaboration Platforms**: Tools like Mural or Miro facilitate collective intelligence by enabling equal participation, clear structuring of elements, and better overviews for all participants, even in a digital environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.
*   **Hackathons**: Used to impact policy and facilitate new ways of working between public administration innovators, entrepreneurs, and civil society (e.g., the "Art of vs. Virus" initiative) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.
*   **Continuous Training**: Emphasis on leadership, communication, crisis management, and digital skills in training programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

### Preparing for the "Known Unknowns"
Beyond addressing "known knowns" like digitalization, preparing for "known unknowns" requires transforming organizations to be more agile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>. This includes breaking down silos, reforming user-centered services, introducing more experimentation, and using evidence-based policy decisions through better data utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:48">[01:13:48]</a>. The aim is to renew the image of public service as an attractive workplace through extensive use of digital technologies, remote working, work-life balance, and environmental friendliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.

## Public vs. Private Sector Distinction

While many management and skill development principles are relevant to both public and private sectors, some key differences exist:
*   **Recruitment Flexibility**: The public sector is often slower in recruiting for new needs and bringing in specific expertise compared to the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>.
*   **Technology Deployment**: Implementing new technologies and techniques can be slower in the public sector due to immense security dimensions and organizational size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>.
*   **Accountability and Risk-Taking**: Public sector managers face stricter accountability regarding taxpayer money, making it harder to foster an environment where mistakes are tolerated or risks are taken without fear of audit or political backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.
*   **Evolving Roles**: The relative roles of public and private sectors are evolving. Private tech giants, with vast data on citizen behavior, may gain significant ability to influence or achieve policy outcomes, blurring the traditional boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>.

## Commitments for the Future

Panelists shared personal commitments for the future of public service:
*   **Peter Pogotar (Slovenian Ministry of Public Administration)**: Focus on cherishing and facilitating informal contacts and "management by walking around" in a hybrid work model, recognizing the importance of social connection for team building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a>.
*   **Cheryl Chung (Singapore Futures)**: Committed to democratizing futures thinking and connecting public, private, and individual sectors in a "collective intelligence" approach, as everyone will build the future together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.
*   **Katarina Primovich Ramovez (Nildu)**: Committed to co-creating the future, making a positive impact, and "walking the talk" by driving a sustainable approach within her organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:44">[01:24:44]</a>.
*   **Fabiana Scapolo (European Commission)**: Committed to focusing more on team performance than individual performance and reflecting on how a flatter, less hierarchical organization could be more effective and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>.
*   **Daniele Dotto (European Commission, DG REFORM)**: Committed to continuing hybrid team work, respecting individual preferences, and focusing even more on training to enable people to handle any future crisis, rather than just one specific crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>.

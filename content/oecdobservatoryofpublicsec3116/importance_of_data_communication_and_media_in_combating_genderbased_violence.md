## The "Shadow Pandemic" of Gender-Based Violence (GBV)
Gender-based violence (GBV) is described as a "global pandemic" in itself, with more than one-third of women estimated to have experienced some form of violence at least once in their lifetimes even before the COVID-19 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this crisis worldwide, leading to a significant increase in GBV rates, particularly during lockdowns when women and girls were confined with abusers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This escalation has been referred to as the "shadow pandemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Combating GBV effectively requires strategic planning and proactive action from governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, moving beyond just gender departments to a [[wholeofgovernment_approaches_to_genderbased_violence | whole-of-government approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>, and incorporating a [[incorporating_survivor_feedback_and_intersectionality_in_policy_making | survivor-centric approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

## The Crucial Role of Communication and Media
Effective communication and public awareness campaigns are vital in combating GBV, especially during crises.

### Raising Awareness and Assuring Support
*   **Media Engagement**: The media plays a "crucial role" in bringing light to the "shadow pandemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. In Switzerland, media outlets published articles and sent questions, helping to inform the public that domestic violence remained a priority for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Public Messaging**: Governments must "go public" and make it clear that domestic, child, and sexual violence "will never be accepted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. This includes assuring victims that support services are open and available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.
    *   Switzerland launched a poster campaign in 13 languages, distributed through professional organizations like grocery stores and pharmacies, to inform the population about zero tolerance for domestic violence and the availability of help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
    *   Chile included information about its help channels in daily COVID sanitary reports on national TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>, and displayed contact numbers on news segments covering GBV cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
    *   Campaigns like "There is no place for violence in this community" (through municipalities) and "Do it for her" (inviting third-party complaints) were used in Chile to promote channels and reinforce collective responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.

### Adapting Communication Channels
The pandemic highlighted the need for [[digital_tools_for_communication_in_public_services | flexible and creative solutions]] in delivering services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.
*   **Helplines**: Governments provided more financial support to helplines due to increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. In Chile, calls to hotlines increased by 250% during lockdowns, prompting increased resources and additional shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **New Digital Channels**: To overcome bottlenecks, Chile developed new silent helplines, including a WhatsApp line, an online website, and a pilot for SMS messages to hotlines to reach those without smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.
*   **Community Partnerships**: Chile formed an alliance with pharmacies for women to get information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a> (though this was later transformed into an information point due to training resource intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>). They also partnered with the state bank, Banco Estado, to make GBV information available in its network of 30,000 local banking shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>. The private sector was engaged to prevent and detect GBV among employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.

## The Imperative of Data Collection and Analysis
[[The_role_of_data_in_crisis_management_and_resilience_building | Data]] is fundamental for developing evidence-based policy responses and understanding the situation of survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>.
*   **Monitoring and Information Flow**: Switzerland established a short-term information flow to collect weekly data from police, victim support services, shelters, and other stakeholders across urban and rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
*   **Challenges in Data Collection**: While some countries like Chile saw a "huge increase" in demand for services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, others like Switzerland did not observe a general increase in police-reported domestic violence cases, emphasizing the complexity of data interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.
*   **Need for Robust Data**: There is a critical need for "better data" that is "sound" and "reliable" to identify target groups and develop efficient measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>. This includes data to understand the "pathways that survivors take" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>.
*   **Single Registry/Platform**: Chile is working on developing a single registry or platform to unify relevant information and data from survivors to avoid secondary victimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>.
*   **International Focus on Data**: The upcoming United Nations World Data Forum in Switzerland will feature gender statistics and violence statistics as important elements, recognizing the global challenge in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>.

## Listening to Survivors and Continuous Learning
*   **Survivor-Centric Approaches**: [[incorporating_survivor_feedback_and_intersectionality_in_policy_making | Listening to survivors]] and incorporating their experiences is a "key message" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. Professionals, despite their knowledge, must ask survivors "what do you need from me? How can I help you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. Focus groups with survivors can reveal surprising insights and help improve services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.
*   **Innovation and Adaptation**: The pandemic has highlighted the need for [[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_addressing_genderbased_violence | innovation]], creativity, and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>. Governments must learn from what worked and what didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.
*   **Mutual Learning and Exchange**: It is often unnecessary to "reinvent the wheel"; instead, conditions for mutual learning and exchange of practices should be prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>. Examples like the European Family Justice Center Alliance sharing experiences with the Alliance for Hope International in the US demonstrate effective cross-border learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Strategies**: The OECD's Technical Advisory Group on GBV is finalizing a framework with three pillars: a systems approach with intersectional coordination and holistic legislation, tackling cultural change for survivor-centric responses and access to justice, and improving accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:38">[02:07:38]</a>. This provides a roadmap for strengthening responses and being better prepared for crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:26">[02:14:26]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated discussions around the evolving nature of public sector innovation and the future role of government [00:00:46]. This global experiment has highlighted both the limitations of conventional policymaking and the potential for new approaches, particularly through the formation and strengthening of political coalitions [01:17:14].

## Crisis as a Catalyst for Change

Crises do not always lead to change, nor do they always lead to positive change [01:18:24]. The likelihood of a crisis spurring lasting transformation depends on three conditions:
1.  **Pre-existing Momentum and Capacity**: Was there already momentum and capacity for change before the crisis? Change rarely comes from nowhere [01:18:31].
2.  **Prefiguring the Future**: Does the crisis offer glimpses of future possibilities in its immediate response [01:18:39]?
3.  **Ideas and Coalitions Post-Crisis**: Are there sufficient ideas and political coalitions to seize the opportunity when policymakers' minds are open to different approaches [01:18:50]?

The pandemic has created a "plastic hour"â€”a crucial moment when an ossified social order becomes pliable, allowing for action, motion, and hope [01:16:48]. These moments require the right alignment of public opinion, political power, and events [01:17:09], and depend on social mobilization and [[democracy_and_public_participation_in_policy | leadership]] [01:17:18].

## Challenges in Coalition Building

Traditional government decision-making has often been based on an outdated idea that governments possess all the answers and that citizens will simply follow their announcements [07:54:00]. This notion has proven to be a fallacy, as mechanisms for deep or "radical listening" are often immature, leading to limited spaces for collaboration and quick assumption of power by a few [08:13:00]. This siloed approach within government can result in more "shouting" than listening among departments [03:51:00].

A significant challenge to building effective political coalitions and fostering lasting change lies in the existing incentive structures within politics and government [04:32:00]. There is a concern that these deep-seated incentives may remain largely unchanged, and that any apparent shifts are merely temporary suspensions during times of fear and anxiety [04:45:00]. The public sector may feel pressure to adapt if new narratives of success emerge, emphasizing societal cohesion and inclusion of marginalized communities, rather than solely technocratic measures like low case numbers [02:29:00].

## Opportunities for New Political Alignments

The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted new opportunities for coalition building:

*   **Accelerated Policy Shifts**: Policies once deemed unacceptable or heretical, such as social distancing, free childcare, or universal basic income, have been broadly tolerated or even welcomed by the public [02:05:00]. This suggests a more fluid social contract and a willingness to exercise "new muscles" in the relationship between citizens and the state [02:50:00].
*   **Shifting Policymaking Paradigms**: The crisis has accelerated a questioning of conventional policymaking, pushing towards a mindset of "thinking like a system and acting like an entrepreneur" [00:20:16].
*   **Beyond New Public Management**: The "massive global failed experiment" of new public management, while seemingly resilient, faces a new challenge [02:03:00]. The crisis reveals two converging imperatives: a technocratic push towards digital advancement, analytical skills, and preemptive systems, and a relational imperative emphasizing collaboration between the state, citizens, and communities [02:11:00]. The key question is whether these two can be combined to create a new model of public services [02:22:00].
*   **The Private Sector's Role**: The private sector, which played a problematic role in the era of new public management, has become more socially conscious and reputationally concerned [03:39:00]. There's an opportunity to work with consultancies and other large corporations to encourage responsible contributions rather than merely profit-driven solutions [03:48:00].
*   **Social Justice Movements**: Events like Black Lives Matter have brought a deeper focus on anti-racism and equality, particularly among younger people, demanding real change beyond mere words or targets [03:50:00]. These movements, while potentially inward-looking, are powerful drivers of progress and can challenge the status quo [03:53:00].

## The Future of Public Policy and Political Collaboration

For change to be sustained, there needs to be continued experimentation and innovation, especially at the city level, where a faster pace of innovation is observed [03:32:00]. Political will is paramount, and progressives, for instance, need to articulate a coherent vision for public services, avoiding splits between incremental and radical approaches [03:38:00].

The pandemic has also forced a re-evaluation of public finance orthodoxies. The realization that substantial funds can be found when needed challenges the notion of artificial constraints on spending [04:54:00]. This may lead to citizens questioning why certain areas of public policy, like aged care, are underfunded, if the capacity for greater deficit or debt financing exists [05:00:00].

Ultimately, the future of [[challenges_and_solutions_in_public_policy_implementation | public policy implementation]] and [[collaborative_efforts_in_public_health_governance | collaborative efforts]] hinges on fostering deeper listening, continuous learning, and adaptability [01:15:55]. It requires leaders who prioritize "being" (values, behaviors, relationships) over "doing" (processes), encouraging a shift towards an inspirational [[leadership]] that supports the workforce and recognizes the value of communities as active partners in recovery and rebuilding [01:04:16]. It is a time to leverage the "innovation dividend" by documenting and reflecting on new approaches and experiences [01:14:31].

Governments are increasingly recognizing the need to anticipate, experiment, and explore [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | systemic solutions]] to current and upcoming challenges [00:00:46]. This urgency has been highlighted by crises, which open windows of opportunity for exploring new policy options and bringing different solutions to the table [00:01:04]. The core question remains how to sustain this momentum beyond immediate crises, making governments more anticipatory and transformative [00:01:23].

## Understanding Systems Thinking in Governance

Policymaking operates within complex adaptive systems, encompassing culture, markets, technology, regulation, and the physical environment, all of which continually co-evolve [00:05:30]. In such systems, the outcome of innovations can be largely uncertain, and scaling up solutions may take time to understand their full effect [00:05:49]. Effective governance in this environment requires agile and flexible models [00:10:08].

Marton Herczeg likens complex adaptive systems to a flock of starlings, where hundreds of birds move in a seemingly coordinated way without a single leader, following only simple rules in relation to their closest neighbors [00:04:41]. This analogy illustrates how complex systems can emerge from simple, distributed interactions.

## Approaches and Methods

### Agile and Adaptive Working Methods
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), as Europe's largest innovation network, has adopted agile and adaptive working methods, including mission-oriented approaches [00:07:37]. Their strategy for navigating [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | complexity]] involves:
*   **Impact-driven planning:** Ensuring projects contribute to specific elements of EIT's mission, such as creating new products or fostering entrepreneurial skills [00:28:38].
*   **Distributed model:** Utilizing over 2,000 partners across various knowledge and innovation communities (KICs) to manage grants and activities [00:29:30]. This distributed approach, akin to beehives, emphasizes subsidiarity and maximizes interaction across disciplines [00:07:19].
*   **Rapid response:** During a crisis, EIT could quickly assess its portfolio and repurpose projects, channeling substantial budget towards new innovation projects and ventures [00:30:19]. This adaptability allowed for fast deployment of solutions, such as a virtual control center for COVID-19 patients that reduced mortality rates [00:08:45].

### Goal-Based Regulation
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) advocates for a shift from rule-based to goal-based regulation, especially in the context of fast-developing cyber-physical systems [00:13:32]. This approach allows for more innovative methods to achieve regulatory goals [00:13:38]. Key aspects include:
*   **Multi-stakeholder creation of guidelines:** Under goal-based regulation, diverse stakeholders collectively create guidelines and standards, enabling even small companies to leverage technology [00:13:44].
*   **Real-time monitoring:** Businesses primarily conduct real-time monitoring to ensure regulatory goals are met, maintaining accountability for collected data [00:13:55].
*   **Continuous review and feedback:** Guidelines and standards are continuously reviewed based on feedback from real-time data [00:14:08].
*   **Collaborative enforcement:** Instead of strict penalties, incentives like deferred prosecution agreements encourage businesses to cooperate with investigations and commit to future improvements [01:02:19]. This fosters information disclosure and helps governments learn about future problems [01:03:25].

### [[Role of Foresight in Policymaking | Anticipatory Governance]] and Transdisciplinary Research
[[Role of Foresight in Policymaking | Anticipatory governance]] aims to address future challenges by asking questions about plausible futures to act in the present, rather than merely predicting them [00:18:48]. This involves:
*   **Open processes for STI agenda setting:** Including more bottom-up and diverse perspectives in foresight exercises can improve outcomes and enroll more people in problem recognition [00:38:40].
*   **Co-evolution of technology and society:** Recognizing that technology is not a deterministic force but co-evolves with societal structures [00:18:34]. This means developing regulations in tandem with piloting and developing technology, as seen in "living laboratories" for autonomous vehicles [00:53:11].
*   **Transdisciplinary research:** Moving beyond interdisciplinary research to cross boundaries between science and other social and political spheres to bridge the gap between knowledge and action [00:23:05]. This includes fostering collaboration between private and public sector science [00:23:36].
*   **Agility of the science system:** Accelerating the dissemination of scientific knowledge to policy circles and the public is crucial for rapid crisis response [00:24:19].
*   **Supporting institutions and international cooperation:** Ensuring stable and robust institutions dealing with risks (like epidemiology and public health) are adequately funded [00:24:40]. Global scientific networks are vital for sharing knowledge, especially for developing countries [00:25:21].

### [[integrating_missionoriented_approaches_in_government_and_policymaking | Mission-Oriented Approaches]]
[[integrating_missionoriented_approaches_in_government_and_policymaking | Mission-oriented approaches]] help bridge the gap between long-term goals and immediate action [01:05:10]. They involve setting clear, visible, longer-term goals (e.g., decarbonizing production systems) and articulating step-by-step approaches to achieve them [01:05:51]. This also fosters cooperation and coordination among different agencies, facilitating innovation across governmental structures [01:06:17].

## Challenges in Adopting Systems Thinking

Despite the recognized benefits, implementing [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | systems thinking]] and anticipatory approaches in policymaking faces several challenges:
*   **Mindset resistance:** A tendency to extrapolate the past and struggle to embrace "deep uncertainty" where the future may be radically different [00:36:08].
*   **Low perceived role of science:** The role of science in society is often too low, with inadequate communication from scientists and insufficient perception by the public and policymakers [00:36:54].
*   **Political and budget cycles:** Traditional budget and political cycles are often too short to accommodate the long-term perspective required for foresight and systemic change [00:50:06]. The frequent change in personnel positions also makes continuous engagement difficult [00:50:11].
*   **Lack of public pressure:** For certain probabilistic dangers (like pandemics), there might not be enough public pressure to prioritize crisis management, as it's not a "sexy" or politically rewarding topic [00:39:00].
*   **Market profitability:** Certain critical interventions, such as vaccine development, may not be profitable for industry in normal times, creating a challenge for private sector engagement without clear market signals [00:39:42].
*   **Translating foresight into action:** Foresight exercises may not gain traction if scenarios are not translated into today's decisions for desired plausible futures, leading to a "future's thinking impact gap" [01:03:51].
*   **Measuring impact:** In complex systems, measuring clear attribution or contribution to change is often impossible with 100% certainty, posing a challenge for reward systems for policymakers [01:10:10].

## Recommendations for the Future

To navigate and learn from [[complexity_and_systems_thinking_in_governance | complexity]] rather than trying to escape it [00:55:07], several commitments and approaches are suggested:
*   **Accepting complexity:** Policy makers must first accept that they operate within complex adaptive systems [00:55:51].
*   **Focus on robust portfolios of options:** Identify sets of actions that work across different plausible future scenarios, seeking co-benefits or multiple dividends [01:07:51].
*   **Empower society and adjust reward systems:** Encourage society to accept these approaches and adjust reward systems for policymakers and politicians to account for the difficulty in attributing success in complex systems [01:09:53].
*   **Continuous learning and adaptation:** Governments should view goal-based regulation as a learning system, continuously checking, reviewing, and getting feedback on whether goals are achieved and whether the public is satisfied [01:02:17].
*   **Study successful models:** Analyze current experiments in science, technology, and innovation, like those during the COVID-19 crisis, to identify effective models of collaboration and cooperation that can be applied in other contexts [01:12:58].
*   **Integrate foresight into planning:** Every new scientific project or research should consider how the knowledge created can be generalized for future crises [01:12:09].
*   **Invest in future resilience:** Not to panic, but to be better safe than sorry, and to invest in being "fit for fight with uncertainty" [01:13:33].

The overall sentiment is that governments need to acknowledge their limitations in planning and ordering everything by themselves [01:11:18]. Instead, the path forward involves embraceing multi-stakeholder experimentation, cross-discipline, and cross-border approaches to achieve shared goals [01:11:31].

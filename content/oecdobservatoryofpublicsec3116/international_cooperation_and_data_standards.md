The "Digitally Enabled State of the Government After Shock" conference organized by the OECD gathered over 4,000 people across more than 60 events in 17 countries, focusing on topics like data governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Key themes that emerged include the need to foster learning, experimentation, and creativity in public sectors, the urgent need for transformation to strengthen government resilience, and the call for governments to be more agile, people-oriented, and [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaborative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A central question is whether data, and its better use, can help address these challenges and build more resilient governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Accelerated Shift to Digital and Data

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated digital transformation within the public sector. Microsoft's Corporate Vice President for Worldwide Public Sector, Julia Glidden, noted that the industry saw more digital transformation in two months than in two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Public sector agencies similarly experienced more transformation in two months than in 20 years, as governments rapidly leveraged data to identify health hotspots, manage medical supplies, and deploy first responders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This rapid response was possible due to pre-existing digital infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### National Successes and Data Infrastructure

Many countries and cities had built critical digital infrastructure five to seven years prior, which proved invaluable during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

*   **Singapore's Proactive Approach**: Singapore implemented a "government data architecture" years ago, focusing on establishing single sources of truth for data, cleaning it up, and creating "trusted centers" for data preservation and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. Their Apex data exchange, an API gateway built four years prior, streamlined data access between agencies, reducing data sharing times from months to days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. This infrastructure was crucial for rapid contact tracing efforts, reducing the cycle from five-six days to less than two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. The political support for investing in this digital future was also a key factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>. Singapore also trained about 20,000 civil servants over four years on how to use data to solve problems and ask the right questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.

*   **UK's Response to Vulnerable Citizens**: The UK's Government Digital Service rapidly established [[data_sharing_and_governance_in_cities | data sharing]] agreements with various public sector departments and industry partners to support 2.2 million clinically vulnerable people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. These agreements, which would normally take months, were completed in weeks, demonstrating a willingness to adjust risk appetite while adhering to data protection and ethical frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. The UK's national data strategy, with a vision for joined-up, trusted public services by 2030, identifies four areas for focus: capability, data standards and quality, interoperability of systems, and appropriate deployment of legal frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

Despite successes, the crisis highlighted ongoing challenges and areas for improvement.

*   **Cultural and Administrative Barriers (France)**: In France, the crisis revealed cultural and administrative barriers to government's capacity to use data and [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | work with civil society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Civil society often moved faster in providing open health data or mapping services than the administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Lack of transparent data led to mistrust and a rise in conspiracy theories, undermining public confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. The French government's choice of a centralized tracing app infrastructure was also seen as less trustworthy due to vulnerability concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>.

*   **Formulating the Right Questions**: Stefan Ferlus of The GovLab at NYU highlighted that governments need to become more sophisticated not just in using data, but in formulating questions for which data can provide answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Sourcing these critical questions internally and externally, and building [[collaboration_and_public_sector_partnerships | collaborations]] around them, would lead to faster and more comprehensive insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

*   **Building Trust and Public Engagement**: Public trust in data use is crucial for widespread adoption of tools like contact tracing apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Engaging the public through initiatives like "citizens' assemblies" on data use can foster understanding and trust, leading to greater willingness to provide data when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. The "fun" aspect, as exemplified by Taiwan's "fast, fair, and fun" approach or Germany's humorous video campaigns, can also help promote desired behaviors and build public acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

*   **Ethical Use and Regulation**: The crisis prompted the rapid deployment of new technologies like facial recognition and drones for surveillance, raising concerns about privacy and the need for clear regulation regarding data collection, storage, and access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. Ensuring that the potential of these technologies does not cross basic rights is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.

### Strengthening International Cooperation

The challenges at a national level are amplified globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>. The need for international cooperation and common [[data_sharing_and_governance_in_cities | data standards]] is more urgent than ever to tackle global issues like vaccine distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

*   **Global Platforms for Data Flow**: There is an urgent need for an international global platform to facilitate the trusted, private, systematic, sustainable, and responsible flow of data across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. This requires strong [[government_collaboration_across_borders | government collaboration across borders]], private sector involvement, research institutions, and civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.

*   **Human Infrastructure for [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | Data Collaboratives]]**: To make data [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | collaboration]] more systematic and sustainable, a human infrastructure is needed, particularly on the private sector side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. The concept of "chief data stewards" is proposed: individuals or teams within organizations whose specific function is to manage external data requests, determine appropriate data access conditions, and coordinate internal sign-offs for data reuse in the public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.

## Overcoming Bureaucracy and Silos

While the crisis has shown what's possible, panelists generally agree that it alone will not be enough to fully overcome long-standing issues like bureaucracy and siloed government structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. However, it has proven the value of data as a critical asset and the need to invest in a comprehensive [[data_governance_for_public_sector_innovation | data infrastructure]] (technical, policy, and human) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. The experience has "tasted the future" and demonstrated that the "genie cannot be put back in the bottle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

The challenge now is to leverage this momentum to continuously build trust, ensure equity in service delivery, and maintain a focus on humanity in the design and use of technology and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>. This means continuous investment in foundational data elements, strengthening [[intergovernmental_and_crosssectoral_collaboration | cross-sectoral collaboration]], and fostering responsible innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>.

The rapidly changing world and unpredictable future necessitate a new approach to public sector services [00:00:32]. Citizens, accustomed to excellent services from the private sector, expect public services to be customer-focused, efficient, innovative, personalized, and enabled by technology [01:01:02]. To meet these expectations, the public sector must innovate and transform, embracing agile practices and new ways of working [01:18:18].

## Core Principles

### Customer Focus and Co-creation
A fundamental shift is needed to ensure public services are designed with the user in mind.
*   Public sector services must be customer-focused [01:02:02].
*   Co-creating services directly with citizens is crucial [02:05:05]. This promotes active citizenship and requires platforms to connect directly with people [02:10:08].

### Agile and Flexible Organizations
To provide excellent services, the public sector needs to become an agile organization [02:16:00].
*   Agility requires flexibility to adapt to citizens' needs [02:27:00].
*   Organizations should be flatter, team-based, and aligned with strategy [02:31:00].
*   Formalizing agile working practices like remote working, which were adopted during the pandemic, is important [01:32:00].
*   Public administration demonstrated agility and responsiveness during the COVID-19 pandemic, adapting quickly to new ways of working and communicating [03:56:00]. This agility and [[innovative_public_service_design | innovation]] should now be amplified in structure and work processes to create a "better normal" [04:05:00].

### Importance of People
Ultimately, everything revolves around people [02:38:00].
*   Having the right people in the right places is essential [02:42:00].
*   Strategic workforce planning should be re-evaluated to recruit civil servants who are innovative and collaborative [02:45:00].
*   Jobs and processes need redesigning to enable greater efficiency and innovative thinking [02:56:00].
*   Continuous upskilling and reskilling of civil servants is vital to keep pace with new technologies and complex societal problems [03:07:00]. Skills needed include critical thinking, creativity, [[innovative_public_service_design | innovation]], problem-solving, and anticipating future scenarios [03:27:00]. The most important skill is the ability to continuously learn and adapt [03:36:00].
*   Public administration should become a learning organization, capable of learning from the past and anticipating the future [03:41:00].

## Design Thinking and Human-Centered Approaches

The rise of [[usercentered_service_design | design thinking]], systems approaches, and innovation labs over the past decade has been very valuable to the public sector [00:06:45].

### Imagining and Implementing a Different Public Sector
This special time can be used to imagine and implement a radically different public sector that is more fit for the future [00:06:21]. Rather than starting with the present, the approach should be to imagine new futures and then mobilize stakeholders around them [00:07:46].

### Leveraging Design and Foresight
Combining [[usercentered_service_design | design]] methods and foresight allows for immersion and exploration of future stories, putting oneself in the shoes of future citizens or decision-makers [00:08:51].
*   Examples include exploring the future of healthcare from a patient's perspective [00:09:04].
*   [[Humancentered design in public services | Design thinking]] principles for leading [[innovative_public_service_design | innovation]] include exploring problems, leveraging empathy with citizens' needs, navigating ambiguity, and insisting on rehearsing and experimenting with the future [01:23:38].

### Evolution from Human-Centered to Human-Connected Design
While [[humancentered_design_in_public_services | human-centered design]] has been the dominant narrative for the past decade, there's a need to rethink design towards "human connected design" [01:16:16].
*   This encompasses humans connected to each other, rebuilding social infrastructure [00:47:25].
*   It also extends to humans connected to AI, infrastructure, the places we live, and our connections with the planet [00:47:32].

### Challenging Mindsets and Structures
[[Usercentric design and implementation | Design thinking]] and creative practices are good, but not enough [00:07:18]. Fundamentally, mindsets and structures within government can be incompatible with desired futures [00:34:40].
*   It's important to challenge existing ways of doing things [00:34:50].
*   Overcoming resistance to new practices (e.g., remote working) requires addressing incompatible mindsets [00:35:47].
*   Similarly, rigid procurement processes can impede agile ways of working in the public sector [00:36:50].
*   The challenge function of foresight and design can help untangle these legacies [00:37:11].
*   The ability to frame and reframe problems, moving away from policy silos and focusing on what citizens understand and how to motivate public servants, is crucial [01:10:01].

### Openness and Collaboration
Public organizations are becoming more open by design, needing to engage with various stakeholders and viewpoints [01:12:12].
*   This includes flatter organizations focused on teams rather than departments or command lines [01:12:32].
*   Open digital infrastructure also builds more dynamic capabilities [01:12:42].
*   The concept of "government as a system" encourages policymakers to use broader tools like convening and stewardship of whole systems, beyond just regulation and law-making [00:52:47].
*   A shift from a command-control, competitive model to a more open, collaborative, and creative model for government and governance is necessary [00:53:52].
*   This openness leads to an emerging capability around the ethics of [[innovative_public_service_design | innovation]], requiring civil servants to consider their own ethics and biases while bringing in diverse perspectives [01:13:32].

### Analytical Capacities and Diversity
Traditional governmental analytical tools often look backward [01:14:17]. To anticipate the future, building diversity into public sector organizations is key [01:14:28]. This means embracing a diversity of analytical viewpoints, integrating ethnographic analysis alongside statistical and economic analysis [01:14:32]. This diversity also addresses questions of power in how events are analyzed [01:14:47].

### Leadership for Exploration
Future leadership in innovation involves discovering what kind of change is needed and taking leadership for exploration, openness, and discovery, rather than control and detailed administration [01:12:22]. It's about insisting on rehearsing and experimenting with the future [01:22:47].

### Seizing the Moment
The current period of "liquefaction," where things that were solid turn to liquid, presents a short-lived but important moment for change [00:46:16]. This allows for rethinking and re-envisioning the public sector [00:47:13]. The "art of the possible" has expanded, and collective imagination is needed to drive positive futures [01:16:00].

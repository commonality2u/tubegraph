This article explores the concept of [[missionoriented_innovation | Mission Oriented Innovation]], its challenges, practical implementation, and future directions, drawing insights from various organizations and countries. The discussion stems from a webinar co-hosted by the OECD Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]], the OECD Directorate for Science, Technology, and Innovation, and the OECD Development Cooperation Directorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Introduction
Many [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]] organizations are adopting a [[missionoriented_innovation | Mission-Oriented Innovation]] approach, but the primary challenge lies in operationalizing their ambitions and experimenting to make missions work in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The focus is on gaining insights into practical implementation, particularly concerning the long-term governance of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The OECD's understanding of this policy approach has progressed through observing on-the-ground practices and identifying good practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Defining [[Missionoriented innovation in public policy | Mission-Oriented Innovation Policy]]
[[missionoriented_innovation_in_public_policy | Mission-Oriented Innovation Policy]] is defined as a coordinated package of policy and regulatory measures specifically tailored to mobilize science, technology, and innovation to address societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Key characteristics of this policy package include:
*   **Scope** It spans several stages of the innovation cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Instruments** It utilizes diverse policy instruments, from supply-side to demand-side, and even regulatory measures, employing both top-down and bottom-up approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Collaboration** It crosses different policy fields, sectors, and disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Goals** It targets ambitious, bold, and concrete measurable goals to be met within a defined timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Key Dimensions and Challenges
[[missionoriented_innovation | Mission orientation]] has three main dimensions, each with specific challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>:

### Strategic Orientation
The main challenge is creating broad consensus on selected societal challenges and translating them into clear, bold objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Questions in this area include:
*   How to create customized missions for specific situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   How to define the right mission, considering its context-dependent scope, depth, granularity, focus, and boldness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   How to secure and balance the involvement of diverse stakeholders (politicians, experts, policymakers), and manage the risk of mission inflation or dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   How to go beyond traditional stakeholders, including citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Policy Coordination
The main challenge is coordinating public and private actors across various silos (disciplinary, sectoral, policy) to work towards commonly agreed missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Questions include:
*   How to engage policy bodies beyond the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) area, including sectoral ministries and regulatory bodies, which is crucial for addressing societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   How to coordinate actors across different levels of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   Setting up governance structures can be complex and requires significant understanding and negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Policy Implementation
The core challenge is implementing packages of complementary policy and regulatory instruments to achieve agreed objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Questions include:
*   How to practically connect supply-side and demand-side instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   How to manage solution portfolios, given that missions are supposed to be solution-neutral and problem-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   How to monitor and evaluate these systemic policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

Despite these challenges, [[missionoriented_innovation_in_public_policy | Mission-Oriented Innovation Policy]] offers a dedicated, tailor-made space for collective action adapted to each area and institutional setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This space allows for co-creation of objectives and targets, setting up specific governance structures, and designing an intentional policy mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This systemic approach is challenging but is to be developed gradually through experimentation and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## OECD's Mission Action Lab
The OECD aims to address the challenges of operationalizing missions in practice through the "Missions Action Lab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. This initiative seeks to:
*   Participate in mission creation and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration across countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
*   Work on the ground in three to four demonstration cases across different mission areas and types, starting in Autumn 2021 or 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
*   Work across OECD countries and low/middle-income countries to learn from diverse experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
*   Build a community for sharing knowledge on how missions are set and run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   Focus on governing missions, policy setting, and implementation, addressing concrete problems like projectification, procurement, and cross-government engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
*   Explore mission operationalization and contextual factors, including system mapping tools and approaches for cities, regions, and governments working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

## [[Missionoriented innovation in healthcare | Mission-Oriented Innovation]] in Low and Middle-Income Countries
The OECD's work, in collaboration with University College London's Institute for Innovation for Public Purpose, distills lessons on implementing missions in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. While high, middle, and low-income countries share important characteristics in addressing complex challenges, differences exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

Key distinctions in LMICs include:
*   **Problem Type** Missions can address complicated problems (e.g., connecting schools worldwide to the internet via GIGA) or complex challenges (e.g., Family Planning 2030, which requires technical innovations and changes in gender norms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Scale** Missions can be global (e.g., Gavi for vaccine access) or national/place-based (e.g., Colombia's fiber optic cable mission) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Actor Involvement** LMICs often involve bilateral development providers, multilateral institutions (including financial institutions), national governments, and social movements, adding layers of complexity to mission formulation and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Strategic Orientation** The degree to which a mission is localized and owned by national actors (government, civil society) versus external influences is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Missions must reflect the capabilities and capacities of the national innovation ecosystem, often requiring integral tech transfer models, unlike high-income countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Policy Coordination** Existing coordination mechanisms in international development (e.g., UN coordination system, poverty reduction strategies, humanitarian cluster system) must be assessed for their fitness to advance cross-sectoral work without "mimicking approaches" that don't undergo necessary institutional transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **Policy Implementation** The "projectification" of work is a major challenge, leading to difficulty in securing long-term commitment due to changing priorities and "development fads" from global North donors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. The established practice of singular project implementation bottlenecks the mission-oriented premise of investing in competing solutions to drive change across sectors, necessitating massive reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## Country Spotlights on Implementation

### Australia: CSIRO's Mission Model
CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, defines its missions as coordinated packages of projects mobilizing science, technology, and innovation to address well-defined societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   CSIRO missions span the innovation cycle from research and development to market deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.
*   Unlike European models, CSIRO does not have a central government funding pool for missions; instead, it aims to "crowd in" existing financial and other resources from industry, government, research, and civil society stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. This creates an imperative for coordination across the innovation system and market validation (attracting external revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.
*   CSIRO has identified 12 mission candidates across six societal challenges where it possesses core science and technology capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. Examples include Net Zero targets, climate risk mitigation, clean batteries, and ending plastic waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.
*   Four missions have been formally launched, committing CSIRO to five- to seven-year implementation programs, including Hydrogen Industry, Future Protein, Trusted Agrifoods, and Drought Resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.

### Norway: Scaling Up [[Missionoriented innovation | Mission Orientation]]
The Research Council of Norway (RCN) has experience with [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] through its "Pilot-E" scheme, which organically developed from inter-agency collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
*   Pilot-E links tools from different agencies to improve services and results, featuring annual targeted calls for technology development up to solutions, such as electric ferries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.
*   This bottom-up scheme, initiated by entrepreneurial individuals in agencies and supported by Ministries without direct funding, is considered an "accelerated mission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.
*   Recommendations include "scaling up" the concept to new areas, such as [[missionoriented_innovation in healthcare | healthcare]], where actors (municipalities, hospitals, healthcare providers) and incentives differ, requiring adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>.
*   A "level up" recommendation involves a central initiative, which is less traditional in Norway's strong sectoral government structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. To transform Norway's oil and gas-dependent industrial structure, a "whole-of-government approach" is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. The government's upcoming long-term plan for research and higher education is envisioned as a platform for broad political agreement on transition initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.

### Vietnam: UNDP's Deep Demonstrations
UNDP Vietnam's "Deep Demonstrations" initiative addresses complex, fast-moving social and environmental challenges that current development organizations are not designed for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.
*   The initiative challenges the traditional single-point, short-term solutions, aiming to explore how UNDP can design and implement development interventions in new ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.
*   In Vietnam, the focus is on the rapid growth's environmental cost, particularly plastic waste (Vietnam is ranked fourth globally) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. The mission aims to address the linear economy's logic and leverage existing resources and increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) for a circular economy transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Sense-Making** UNDP uses an iterative process of portfolio sense-making to learn rapidly, extract insights from current projects, and identify acceleration opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>. This process revealed that while many circular economy interventions exist, they often lack interlinkages and effective learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.
*   **Reframing the Challenge** Through a studio approach involving diverse backgrounds (architects, journalists, economists, biologists), UNDP reframed Vietnam's circular economy challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.
    *   **Beyond Environment** The mandate for circular economy should extend beyond the Ministry of Environment to include other ministries and address fundamental economic and market logics, engaging new actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.
    *   **Treat as Emergency** The transition should be treated as an emergency, similar to Vietnam's agile and silo-breaking response to COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:28">[01:25:28]</a>.
    *   **Future-Proofing** Circular economy transition is about future-proofing Vietnam, managing risks, building resilience, and tapping into economic incentives of low-carbon development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:23">[01:26:23]</a>.
*   **Adaptability** A critical challenge is the need for portfolios to adapt and pivot based on learning from implementation, which current development mechanisms often do not allow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

### Denmark: The Innovation Fund's Mission Program
The Innovation Fund Denmark is working on the first true [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-driven program]] in Denmark, based on a new green research strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.
*   Four green missions (PTX, carbon capture, agriculture/food, circular economy/plastics/textiles) have been identified, with a budget of 700 million DKK (approximately 100 million Euros) for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>.
*   The Innovation Fund asked stakeholders (universities, industry, cluster organizations) to define roadmaps for these missions, and they are now selecting and combining these roadmaps for a second phase call for partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.
*   Challenges include difficulty in quantifying impact from roadmaps, involving all stakeholders equally (especially researchers vying for funding), and the rapid timeline (developing and distributing funds within a year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>.

## Overarching Implementation Challenges
Common challenges faced by organizations implementing [[innovation in the public sector | mission-oriented innovation]] include:

*   **Scaling Up** Once a mission framework is established and launched, the challenge shifts to scaling up the efforts and providing clear signposts beyond impact pathways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>. This involves defining incentives, ongoing monitoring and evaluation, and decision-making points for intervention if programs are not delivering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Formal Issues in Scaling** Bottom-up, entrepreneurial initiatives work well at a small scale by bypassing formal and cultural issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>. However, scaling up brings disparate agency cultures, formal legal differences (e.g., publicizing applicant names), and increased political involvement and "prestige issues," making coordination more complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
*   **Measuring Impact** Difficulty in measuring the impact of different roadmaps, especially when objectives include both environmental (e.g., greenhouse gas reduction) and economic (e.g., competitiveness) outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.
*   **Balancing Focus and Agility** Maintaining focus on the roadmap while retaining agility to adapt to changing circumstances is a key challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>. This also includes incentivizing new participants and the difficult task of stopping underperforming projects, which requires new legal and cultural methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a>.
*   **Industry Involvement** Securing sufficient industry involvement is crucial, as public funding alone is often insufficient to solve large mission problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.
*   **Integrating Policy Types** Combining science policy with demand-side policies, consumer behavior, and regulatory measures is essential to ensure that technological ideas translate into real-world solutions and not just "big partnerships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.
*   **Defining Organizational Role** Organizations stewarding or coordinating missions must define their role in intervening in implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>. This includes acting as a gatekeeper for approvals and providing alternative pathways for activities that may not fit the mission framework but still deliver impact (e.g., spin-out companies or normal research discoveries) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Management** It is important to have a broad overview or "portfolio management system" that tracks all relevant initiatives, whether directly part of a mission program or not, to avoid duplication and identify missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. This requires objectives and tagging projects across programs and budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:45">[01:20:45]</a>.
*   **Mission Lock-in** The challenge of "mission lock-in" emphasizes the need to keep a portion of the portfolio open for unexpected developments, allowing missions to shift or change strategies as learning occurs during implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.

"Government After Shock" is an event designed to make sense of the current complex global context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It is supported by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The event is part of a broader conversation, with over 60 groups worldwide hosting "Gov After Shock" events covering topics such as digital government, sustainable development, [[trust_and_engagement_in_public_governance | trust and inclusion]], governing for an uncertain future, climate crisis, and government communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

The core questions addressed are:
* What needs to be left behind from this crisis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
* What should be kept? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
* What should be done differently? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

This crisis has highlighted the vital role of the state and the need for strong public sector capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. It has also shown that governments can work in more flexible ways with the private sector and the broader community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The goal is to build a more flexible, anticipatory, and resilient state for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Key Learnings from the COVID-19 Crisis

### Speed of Reaction and Societal Cooperation
Latvia's Prime Minister, Artūrs Krišjānis Kariņš, shared a lived experience from the pandemic, emphasizing two key lessons:
1.  **Speed of reaction**: During the first wave, Latvia implemented restrictions before the first death, showing a rapid response that helped "get the curve down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
2.  **Getting society to work with government**: In the first wave, explaining the danger and inviting cooperation led to significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This cooperation allowed decisions to be made within 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. However, the economic impact of restrictions created stress, leading to a slower reaction time (three and a half weeks) and more discussions in the second wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

It is crucial for governments to inform society to ensure cooperation, as "no government can go faster than society is willing to follow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. The importance of [[effective_communication_and_citizen_trust_in_crisis | informing, informing, informing]] society is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### The Role of Public Trust
The crisis has aggravated the "crisis of trust" and instilled fear in the social fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. A trusting relationship between people and their administration is pivotal for addressing societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. High trust leads to better compliance and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Studies show that mobility related to non-essential activities was significantly lower in high-trust regions than in low-trust regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. People's perception of government's competence, integrity, openness, and fairness all matter greatly for [[building_public_trust_in_institutions | building public trust in institutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Reliability and responsiveness of service delivery also significantly influence [[building_trust_in_public_services | people's trust in their governments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

Less than 40% of people in OECD countries feel their voice matters to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. The pandemic is a moment when governments and people absolutely need to come together, with trust acting as the binding element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. If people don't believe what the government tells them, policies will not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>.

## Government Innovation and Digitalization

The crisis has shown that governments can be innovative. For example, experimenting with better communication approaches, coordinating with communities in new ways during lockdowns, and massively shifting to remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### Serbia's Digital Transformation
The Prime Minister of Serbia, Ana Brnabić, highlighted the success of digitalization in preparing her country for the pandemic's challenges. Key achievements include:
*   **e-government**: Fully digitizing government services to provide electronic services to citizens and businesses 24/7, 365 days a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. This ensured continuity of services during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.
*   **Digital education**: Investing in digital textbooks and classrooms meant no schooling days were lost during the pandemic; physical schools stopped, but online learning began the following Monday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **Economic resilience**: Shifting the Serbian economy from labor-intensive to innovation-driven and knowledge-based, with the ICT sector reaching 6% of GDP, helped protect the economy. While industrial production fell, the ICT and services sectors remained strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. Serbia is projected to have a GDP decline of only 0.7-1% in 2020, and unemployment did not increase, instead being further reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
*   **Combating corruption**: Digitalization reduces physical contact between civil servants and citizens/businesses, thereby cutting space for corruption and increasing [[trust_and_transparency_in_public_governance | transparency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. For example, electronic construction permitting made Serbia one of the top 10 countries globally for efficiency and speed in issuing permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>.
*   **Environmental benefits**: Digitalization also contributes to environmental sustainability by saving paper, trees, water, and electricity. Since June 2017, Serbia's government has saved 15,000 trees, 65 million liters of water, and 5,700 megawatts of electricity through digitalization efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.
*   **"My First Salary" program**: This initiative addresses youth unemployment by having the government pay at least 50% of salaries for companies providing first jobs to young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. The program is fully digital, end-to-end, and uses artificial intelligence for matchmaking between youth and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>.

## Preparing for Future Crises and Challenges

The world must continue to adapt to new realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. The crisis has exacerbated underlying issues such as inequalities, economic insecurity, and uneven healthcare access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

Key areas for focus include:
*   **Resilient recovery**: The recovery from COVID-19 must be green, sustainable, inclusive (putting people first), and resilient to future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. "Going back to normal is the last thing we want" as the previous "normal was not good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.
*   **Addressing inequalities**: The crisis has highlighted and potentially widened the gap between rich and poor countries. Innovation-driven, knowledge-based economies suffered less, while labor-intensive economies faced greater challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.
*   **Digital skills**: It is crucial to focus on digital education and skills for lower-skilled individuals to help them integrate into a more digital future economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>. The use of artificial intelligence in government could automate repetitive tasks, freeing civil servants for more meaningful work and increasing efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.
*   **Multilateral cooperation**: The pandemic is a global phenomenon requiring global approaches, international cooperation, and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. Vaccines, for example, should be considered a public good and made available based on needs worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>.
*   **Balancing health protection with civil liberties**: A significant challenge is navigating the tension between protecting public health and upholding individual freedoms and civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. This involves sensitive issues like mandatory mask-wearing, social distancing, tracking movements and contacts, and restrictions on social circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. A public debate is needed to guide governments on how to protect both health and liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.

## Introduction
Social norms play a crucial role in shaping behavior within public administration, particularly concerning integrity and anti-corruption efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommends cultivating a "culture of integrity" throughout society, which involves not only public servants but also businesses, civil society organizations, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

[[Behavioral public policy | Behavioral public policy]] and [[Behavioral insights and their application in public integrity | behavioral insights]] are increasingly used to understand and influence these norms to improve public integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

## Impact of Social Norms on Public Integrity
Traditional anti-corruption measures often focus on corrupt individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. However, [[Behavioral insights and their application in public integrity | behavioral science]] research indicates that most people possess a "moral compass" and strive to act with integrity, even when unobserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. Despite this internal compass, individuals may still act unethically but rationalize their behavior to maintain a perception of honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

This implies that policy should empower public officials who wish to act correctly and foster an environment that supports ethical choices, referred to as an "open culture of integrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. This open culture allows officials to openly discuss ethical concerns without fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.

## Barriers to Reporting Corruption Risks
In Slovakia, a project working with anti-corruption coordinators and public officials identified several behavioral barriers preventing employees from reporting corruption risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>:
*   **Lack of Exemplary Leadership**: Managers often display "ticking the box" behavior, formally complying but not acting in line with the code of conduct, and failing to encourage reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   **Culture of Fear and Silence**: A pervasive "culture of fear" prevents employees from speaking up about potential corruption risks due to concerns about retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Understanding of Risks**: Public officials may not fully understand what constitutes a "potential corruption risk" (e.g., a hiring practice that *might* be problematic), distinguishing it from a clear "corruption incident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Awareness of Reporting Channels**: Despite existing channels, employees may not know how or where to report risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   **Absence of Feedback Loops**: Employees lack feedback mechanisms after reporting, leading to uncertainty about whether their concerns are being addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Experimental Approach to Influence Social Norms
An [[experimental approaches in public administration | experimental approach]] was employed using randomized vignette experiments to test interventions targeting these barriers, specifically focusing on the understanding of risk and exemplary leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

*   **Vignette Design**: A hypothetical situation involving suspected lack of control measures in hiring procedures (a corruption risk) was presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Interventions**: Two messages were tested:
    *   **Understanding of Risk Message**: Compared corruption risk reporting to seeing risk factors for cancer and speaking to a doctor, emphasizing that "every civil servant should be honest and speak about corruption risks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This explicitly applied **injunctive social norms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
    *   **Exemplary Leadership Message**: Described a manager who raises hiring risks and encourages colleagues to do the same, reinforcing that "every civil servant should be honest and speak about corruption risks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This also applied **injunctive social norms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

### Key Findings
*   **Impact of Leadership**: The leadership message was the most impactful, increasing the likelihood of risk communication by approximately 14 percentage points compared to the control group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This suggests that when leaders set an example, employees are more likely to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding of Risks**: The understanding of risks message increased the likelihood by approximately 9 percentage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. However, neither treatment significantly improved the *understanding* of what constitutes a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   **Age and Reporting**: Younger respondents were more likely to communicate a corruption risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. An increase in age by one year decreased the likelihood to communicate an integrity risk by 0.23 percentage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This could be due to a greater fear of retaliation or a status quo bias among more senior individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Career length, however, did not correlate with reporting likelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Feeling of Safety**: Both treatments increased the feeling of safety among respondents, though the effect sizes were small (around three percentage points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Those who preferred to report to a manager felt significantly safer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Trust in the System**: Trust in the risk management system correlated with feeling safe and likelihood to communicate, indicating that people who trust the system are more likely to report risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## Recommendations for Enhancing Integrity and Social Norms
Based on these findings, key recommendations for Slovakia's new National Anti-Corruption Strategy (2024-2029) include:

1.  **Empowering Leaders**: Provide training and resources to leaders and anti-corruption coordinators to equip them with the knowledge and skills to lead by example and act with integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Cross-agency collaboration to redefine code of conduct guidelines is also recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
2.  **Simplifying Risk Communication**: Make the process easy to understand and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Policies should align with employee preferences, such as reporting to managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. Clear, concise, and [[Behavioral insights and their application in public integrity | behaviorally informed]] guidelines should be implemented to raise awareness of existing channels and simplify reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
3.  **Cultivating a Culture of Safety**: Prioritize fostering a culture where employees feel safe to speak up without fear of retaliation, making it a social norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

> [!info] Significance
> This project demonstrates how [[Behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science in public governance]] and [[experimental approaches in public administration | experimental approaches in public administration]] can lead to concrete, evidence-based policy actions in sensitive areas like public integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. The findings underscore the importance of understanding and targeting social norms, as well as the significant impact of leadership in driving [[Innovation in public administration | positive behavioral change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. The study also highlights the need for continued testing and [[Role of innovation in public administration | scaling up]] interventions in real-world settings to ensure lasting impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

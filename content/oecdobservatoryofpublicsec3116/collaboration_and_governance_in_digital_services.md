Effective [[digital_transformation in governance | digital transformation in governance]] requires a strong focus on collaboration and robust governance structures to ensure public services are inclusive and build trust in public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This approach considers users' needs in designing and delivering services in the digital age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## User-Centric Design and Inclusivity
The core challenge in the digital age is to ensure that digital opportunities lead to services that meet the expectations of end-users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This means services must be inclusive and trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. While governments were expected to be "digital by default" during the COVID-19 pandemic, it's crucial to remember that not all citizens want or are able to use online channels for public administration interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Key aspects of user-centric design include:
*   **Omnichannel Approach:** Services should support multiple channels and allow users to switch between them throughout their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This acknowledges that not everyone is comfortable with digital interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   **Accessibility:** Services and communications must be accessible and understandable by everyone, including those with disabilities or limited digital literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.
*   **User Feedback:** Incorporating user feedback at all stages of development and delivery, from design and co-creation to testing and post-release analysis, is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Language:** Public services need to use clear, simple language, avoiding technical jargon and complex organizational structures that citizens may not understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.

### Challenges with "Digital by Default"
The concept of "digital by default" presents several challenges:
*   **Skills and Capabilities of Citizens:** A significant portion of the population may lack the digital skills or comfort required to use online services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Access:** Closing in-person access to government services creates barriers for those unable or unwilling to use digital channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Disconnected Experiences:** A "digital by default" mindset that separates e-services from traditional ones can lead to disconnected user experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Governance and Institutional Frameworks
Effective [[digital_transformation in governance | digital transformation in governance]] relies on robust governance structures, strategic planning, and the right "soft components" like standards and revised core government functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>.

### Strategic Approaches and Policies
*   **OECD Framework:** The OECD Digital Government Policy Framework aims to help governments overcome challenges in leveraging digital opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **System Thinking:** Balancing emergency responses with systematic approaches allows for forward-looking planning and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Digital Public Services Strategy:** Developing a clear strategy, like Slovenia's emerging strategy, is crucial for promoting modern service design, user engagement, and a unified user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Measuring Quality:** Initiatives like France's observatory of digital public services assess quality based on criteria like mobile accessibility, disability accessibility, and data reuse, informing prioritization for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

### Data Governance and Transparency
The effective and trustworthy use of data is a key enabler for digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
*   **Legal Compliance and Ethics:** Data use must always be legally compliant (e.g., with GDPR) and ethically acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.
*   **Once-Only Principle:** Leveraging central registers and common identifiers to pre-fill application forms and enable efficient background data exchange reduces the burden on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.
*   **Transparency:** Governments must demonstrate transparency in the content and use of personal data to build citizen trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>. External, respected institutions (like Slovenia's Information Commissioner) can help legitimize data use and calm public debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

## [[Leadership and collaboration in public service | Leadership and Collaboration in Public Service]]
[[Leadership and collaboration in public service | Leadership and collaboration in public service]] are fundamental to successful [[innovation_and_digital_transformation in public services | innovation and digital transformation in public services]].
*   **Cross-Departmental Collaboration:** Services, as users perceive them, do not stop at departmental boundaries. This necessitates [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | crossborder government collaboration and innovation]] and internal coordination to join up services and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   **Unified Platforms:** A single domain for government services can force departments to work together and simplify interactions for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
*   **Institutional Networks:** Establishing networks like Portugal's Council for Information and Communication Technology and the Interministerial Network for Modernization can facilitate quick responses and coordination across government areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.
*   **Skills and Mindset:** Public servants need digital skills, agile ways of working, and a collaborative mindset to react quickly and procure the right solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Investing in the knowledge and skills of service providers is vital for developing a modern business culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **[[International collaboration in government innovation | International collaboration in government innovation]]:** Engaging with other governments, as seen with the UK's Government Digital Service international team, helps share insights and best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Role of Innovation Labs
Innovation labs can play a role in fostering change within public administration:
*   **Testbeds and Examples:** They provide spaces to experiment, fail, and develop prototypes, offering concrete examples that can inspire public servants and encourage new ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>.
*   **Systematic Rollout:** To be effective, innovation labs should not operate in isolation but have a plan for how their successful experiments can be systematically applied across the broader organization, backed by the power to influence change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a>.
*   **Improving Existing Services:** Innovation should also focus on improving existing, highly-used services rather than solely creating new ones. This rationalization and streamlining can make services more maintainable and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:02">[01:27:02]</a>.

### Conclusion
Digital transformation in governance, including the delivery of public services, must be rooted in [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | collaboration between governments and citizens]] and strong governance frameworks. This ensures services are inclusive, meet diverse user needs, and build lasting trust in public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:49">[01:27:49]</a>.

This article provides an introduction to [[innovation_in_government | public sector innovation]] and how the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) views it, including problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI)

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) was founded in 2016 in partnership with the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. OPSI functions in three main ways:
*   **Uncovering What's Next** OPSI identifies innovative practices within OECD and non-OECD countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Trusted Adviser** OPSI partners with countries on specific issues to help them develop new ways to provide value to citizens and solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Making Innovation the New Normal** OPSI aims to embed innovation into the standard way of working within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The OPSI team, although small with seven members, consists entirely of former public sector employees who have experienced [[innovation_in_government | public sector innovation]] firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Defining Innovation

While there isn't one specific definition for innovation, it's often recognized by its context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. What is innovative in one country or organization might not be in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

However, three common factors define innovation:
1.  **Novelty** It introduces new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
2.  **Implementation** Having creative ideas is part of the innovation lifecycle, but it must be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
3.  **Impact** The implementation must have an impact, which is often difficult to measure in the public sector, especially for truly new initiatives where the right metrics or long-term outcomes may be unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## [[Reasons for government innovation | Reasons for Government Innovation]]

Based on studies, including an innovation culture study in Canada, several [[Reasons for government innovation | reasons for public sector innovation]] have been identified:
*   **Changing Functions** The world is constantly changing, particularly in private lives, leading to expectations for government to also change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Closing the Service Gap** There is a perceived gap between private sector services and public sector services. Governments are pushing hard just to maintain this gap, rather than closing it, necessitating a rethink of value delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **No Room for Spectators** Focusing on innovation labs or training can inadvertently limit a government's ability to innovate if it makes others feel that innovation isn't for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Everyone needs to be engaged, even if not as an expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Increasing Demands from Citizens and Politicians** As possibilities expand, citizens and politicians demand more from government. A failure to respond risks a mismatch where government services no longer align with citizen needs, impacting government value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Innovation as a Core Competency** [[innovation_in_government | Innovation]] needs to be pervasive across government, embedded as a core competency, to better respond to future crises and rethink how government delivers services to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Ways to View Innovation

OPSI views [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] in three distinct ways:
1.  **Delivering on Today** This involves [[enhancement_oriented_innovation_in_government | mission-driven innovation]] to produce better value based on current goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
2.  **Delivering on Tomorrow** This focuses on anticipatory innovation, looking at weak signals and future trends (e.g., autonomous cars, AI, blockchain) to innovate today, anticipating future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
3.  **Ensuring Readiness** This is about building the capacity and capability to innovate when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Key Skills for Innovation

Beyond core job skills, public servants need additional skill areas to think differently and achieve different results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>:
*   **Iteration** Doing things quickly, cheaply, and with reduced risk to get feedback faster and achieve better results, unlike traditional multi-year plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Canada's experiment mandate, allocating budget for programs to experiment, is a good example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Data Literacy** Understanding how data provides greater insights into problems and helps measure impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **User Centricity** Putting the end user at the center of government work, rather than focusing solely on internal process efficiency, which changes conversations and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Co-designing with users helps break down traditional barriers between policy and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **Curiosity** The ability to ask questions and seek new ways of doing things, including horizon scanning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Storytelling** Crafting compelling, short, concise, and memorable stories that resonate with the audience, particularly for pitching projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Insurgency** Questioning the status quo and trying new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Insurgents, though sometimes perceived as problematic, can be excellent at identifying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

These skills are only effective if public servants have the **opportunity** to practice them and the **motivation** to use them, supported by proper incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## The Innovation Lifecycle

OPSI has developed a six-step innovation lifecycle:
1.  **Identifying Problems** Ensuring the right problem is being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
2.  **Generating Ideas** Coming up with new ideas inclusively and collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
3.  **Developing Proposals** Filtering ideas to determine which ones to pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
4.  **Implementing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
5.  **Evaluating** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
6.  **Diffusing** Identifying and spreading best practices and lessons learned (including from failures) across the organization, an area where the public sector has traditionally struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

This lifecycle is not linear; it's a cycle where one may need to revisit previous steps, such as generating new ideas or re-identifying problems, if initial solutions don't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

### Problem Framing

Problem framing is the initial and crucial stage of the innovation lifecycle.

**Example: GE's MRI Machine**
GE developed a world-class MRI machine but received complaints because children were terrified, leading to 80% needing sedation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. Instead of framing it as a design or technology failure, GE reframed the problem around the *experience* of using the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. They created themed experiences (like pirate ships or outer space) where technicians told stories incorporating the machine's noises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This simple solution, costing only a few hundred dollars for paint and a script, reduced sedation rates from 80% to under 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

**The Double Diamond Design Methodology**
This traditional design methodology consists of two diamonds:
1.  **Framing the Problem** This involves discovering and investigating the problem to narrow down to the actual issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
2.  **Finding the Solution** This involves ideating and coming up with new ideas for a solution, then narrowing down the list to recommend a few for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

A common [[challenges_of_government_innovation | challenge]] in the public sector is that many public servants start after the first diamond, being given a pre-defined problem or even a solution to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. Ignoring the initial problem-framing stage can lead to disappointing results, a lack of return on investment, and a continuous search for new solutions without addressing the root problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

**Why Governments Struggle with Problem Framing**
OPSI's research on problem framing identified several [[challenges_of_government_innovation | challenges]]:
*   **Push for Quick Responses** The public sector often prioritizes immediate solutions over finding the *right* response. A problem directly in front of us might be a symptom rather than the root cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
*   **Information Overload and Complexity** New information constantly changes how problems are viewed. As problems are analyzed, they can become large, complex, and unwieldy, intimidating individuals who may lack the responsibility or autonomy to address them across different departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
*   **Evolving Problems** Problems can change and evolve, sometimes becoming completely new issues that are not yet understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

**Using New Information to Frame Problems**
New information should be the starting point for asking questions to better frame a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. The process involves:
1.  Receiving new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.
2.  Looking at what is known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
3.  Considering what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
4.  Determining what is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>.
5.  Identifying what is actually needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>.
6.  Finally, defining what the problem is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
This process is cyclical, with constant new information and feedback to evaluate the problem and tweak or scrap solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

**Practical Tips for Problem Framing**
*   **Clarify Intent** Understand what is truly trying to be achieved, beyond superficial metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Make Assumptions Explicit** Clearly separate facts from assumptions. Challenge assumptions to ensure accurate problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   **Avoid Jumping to Conclusions** Resist the urge to immediately jump to solution mode after a brief analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
*   **Connect with Others** Be inclusive and collaborative, bringing in people with diverse experiences and perspectives to broaden the understanding of the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.
*   **Reframe the Problem** Look at the problem from different perspectives to make it easier to explore various solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.

**Common Problem Identification Tools and Strategies**
These tools and strategies aid in problem framing:
*   **Experimentation** Sending signals into the problem space to better understand the problem, rather than immediately seeking solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.
*   **Dashboards** Provide data, but often don't explain *why* something isn't being achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.
*   **Horizon Scanning** Looking at what is happening across a problem space, including other organizations or countries solving similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.
*   **Design Thinking / Human-Centered Design** Focuses on designing experiences, services, and products that meet citizen needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.
*   **Systems Thinking** Taking a holistic view of all actors and elements to fully understand the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Insights** Understanding how people behave and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Learning** Collaborating with peers and networks who are facing similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   **Learning Organizations** Continuously seeking new methods and ways of doing things internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.
*   **Innovation Labs** Dedicated spaces for innovative work, though their structure and effectiveness vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.

It's important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

**Practical Exercise: The Five Whys**
The "Five Whys" is a simple exercise to better frame a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>:
1.  Define the problem based on current understanding.
2.  Ask "why" it's happening.
3.  Continue asking "why" to each subsequent answer to gain a deeper understanding of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.

*Example:* A customer satisfaction score consistently remained low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>. Initial internal discussions yielded anecdotal and conflicting reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. By using tools like clarifying assumptions vs. facts and connecting with end users, it was discovered that customers found the agency "too complex" and "too slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. Further "whys" revealed complexity stemmed from a cumbersome and non-transparent process, largely due to a confusing website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. Simple website tweaks directly improved customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.

## [[Challenges and opportunities in government innovation | Challenges and Advice in Government Innovation]]

Many leaders talk about [[innovation_in_government | innovation]], but actual change can be slow. The evolution of leadership's view on [[innovation_in_government | innovation]] typically progresses from disbelief, to talking about it without underlying change, to having limited innovative projects, and finally to an organization that truly understands that ideas can come from anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

For practitioners in the public sector, the advice is to focus on what is within direct control or influence, even if it's only a small part of a larger process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. Improving those small steps can drive change and influence others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. Organizations are not transformed by single grand ideas, but by continuous learning and improvement in daily work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. This may involve quietly testing things ("doing things in the shadow") before presenting them to management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. Sending leaders to [[Innovation Strategies in Government | innovation training]] can help them understand concepts like iteration, [[Experimentation in government innovation | experimentation]], and prototyping, appreciating their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.

Most public sectors are conservative and risk-averse, often due to political issues, media scrutiny, or a resistance to failure, combined with the use of taxpayer funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>. [[innovation_in_government | Innovation]] is not easy and often encounters stumbling blocks. Innovators need resiliency, persistence, and a network of peers for continuous encouragement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. Organizations like OPSI advocate for [[innovation in government | innovation]] at national government levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.

Regarding the traditional government model of long-term studies versus prototyping and [[Experimentation in government innovation | experimentation]], it's ironic that five-year plans are considered effective for major transformation when future prediction is nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. Countless examples of multi-million dollar government project failures demonstrate the ineffectiveness of relying solely on extensive analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. The mindset needs to shift from trying to perfectly predict the future to understanding that it's better to:
1.  Study the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.
2.  Find a few best solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.
3.  Test them quickly and cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.
Even if all three fail, valuable insights are gained, leading to more informed and higher-chance investments later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. This approach aims for quicker results and shows that the traditional methodology doesn't reduce risk as much as perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.

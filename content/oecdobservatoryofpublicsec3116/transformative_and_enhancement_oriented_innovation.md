[[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]] serves as a crucial foundation from which both transformative and [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]] can emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. These different [[types_of_innovation_missionoriented_enhancement_adaptive_anticipatory | types of innovation]] are vital for progress.

## Adaptive Innovation

[[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]] is fundamentally about the discovery process itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Rather than having clear, predefined goals, it involves exploring new ideas and uncovering what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Key characteristics of [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]]:
*   **Emergence of New Ideas** It is essential for the emergence of novel ideas, especially those that extend beyond existing systems or paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **On-the-Ground Exploration** This approach involves exploring new ideas directly "on the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These ideas may either support existing government services or challenge them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Bottom-Up Approach** It necessitates allowing individuals the space and freedom, from a bottom-up perspective, to explore new concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. People closest to citizens can gather signals from their lives and use this feedback to innovate, test, and experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Outcomes of Adaptive Innovation

[[adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]] can lead to two primary outcomes:

*   **Transformative Innovation** Significant, transformative changes can arise from this exploratory process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.
*   **[[enhancement_oriented_innovation | Enhancement-Oriented Innovation]]** It can also result in [[enhancement_oriented_innovation | enhancement-oriented innovation]], which focuses on improving existing systems or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. Both types of innovation are equally necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

### Example of Enhancement-Oriented Innovation through Adaptation

An example of [[enhancement_oriented_innovation_in_government | enhancement-oriented innovation in government]] stemming from [[adaptive_innovation | adaptive innovation]] can be seen in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Individuals developed applications to simplify regulatory systems, making them more accessible and understandable for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. The objective was to create apps that clarified regulations, such as those applicable when establishing a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This shift in focus from the volume of regulation to its usability for clients is a direct result of [[adaptive_innovation | adaptation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

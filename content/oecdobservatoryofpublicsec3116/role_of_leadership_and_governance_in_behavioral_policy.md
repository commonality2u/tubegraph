The "Logic" report, launched by the OECD, provides good practice principles for [[mainstreaming behavioral public policy | mainstreaming behavioral public policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This report is based on rigorous research combining data from governments worldwide with insights from [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Its aim is to provide guidance and build capacity within government for applying [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science in policy making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

[[Behavioral public policy | Behavioral public policy]] refers to the use of [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] evidence to inform policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. While the application of [[behavioral insights in public policy | behavioral insights in public policy]] has seen significant growth, with over 300 institutions worldwide applying [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] to [[behavioral public policy | public policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, practitioners still face a variety of challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. These challenges are often related to institutional factors and the relationship between [[behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral Science]] teams and their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

The "Logic" framework breaks down the principles for effective [[mainstreaming behavioral science in government | mainstreaming Behavioral Science]] into five key dimensions, with leadership and governance being crucial elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Leadership in Behavioral Public Policy

Leadership refers to the role and relationship of leaders within an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Influential leaders are critical in encouraging the uptake of [[behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral Science]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. When senior government leaders advocate for a people-centered approach and request robust evidence, the use of [[behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral Science]] increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

*   **Senior leaders must request and advocate for [[behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral Science]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. For example, the US federal government recently released an executive order on applying social and [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral sciences]] to federal policies and programs, explicitly promoting [[behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral Science]] as a tool for improving policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Behavioral science managers are responsible for maintaining senior leader support** through regular briefings and engagement at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Political support, while providing clout and opening doors, is time-limited as leaders change or new priorities emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. Therefore, embedding [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] also requires finding areas with autonomy and building trust through a strong track record of demonstrated credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. For instance, the UK's tax authority (HMRC) built strong relationships and conducted a series of trials in debt management, an area with more autonomy, which allowed them to gain traction and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK's furlough scheme saw thorough behavioral input partly due to:
*   The novelty of the scheme, meaning no established norms and less status quo to fight against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.
*   A strong track record of the [[behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral Science]] team, leading to trust and established relationships with senior officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.
*   Senior political buy-in, with the Chancellor (now Prime Minister) being behaviorally astute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.
*   The [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] team's opportunistic nature, knowledge of the organization, and strong communication skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.

## Governance for Behavioral Policy

Governance refers to how [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] fits within the structure of an organization and the resources available to [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. A clear accountability structure for managing resources and activities helps embed [[behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral Science]] efficiently and effectively into policymaking procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

*   **Senior leaders should clearly allocate responsibility for [[mainstreaming behavioral science in government | mainstreaming Behavioral Science]] and establish lines of accountability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This could involve a single senior executive or a team responsible for [[mainstreaming behavioral science in government | mainstreaming Behavioral Science]] across government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   **Sufficient resources must be mobilized by senior leaders and managers** to ensure policy advice is informed by relevant and reliable [[behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral Science]] evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Resources can be placed across a wide variety of areas within the public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

Countries have adopted diverse governance arrangements, including dedicated units in the center of government, specific functions in line agencies, or more dispersed expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Country Examples:

*   **Finland**: The Finnish [[behavioral policy | behavioral policy]] team, based in the prime minister's office, grew to four people and is set to be five in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. Key turning points included the COVID-19 crisis, which prompted benchmarking of [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] use in other countries, leading to a pilot project in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. Successful trials, such as text messages to encourage voting, demonstrated impact and led to team growth and wider work areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. The team believes it cannot afford *not* to use [[behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral Sciences]] for impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   **Brazil**: The [[role of behavioral science in government | Brazilian journey with Behavioral Science]] began with isolated experiences before a significant turning point in 2023 with the inception of Cinco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. Cinco is the first dedicated [[behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral Science]] unit established in a new Ministry focusing on management and innovation in public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. This ministry is responsible for transversal policies across the public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. The unit was created due to advocacy, a change in government structure, and special power to recruit civil servants from various federal organizations, forming a diverse team of 15 full-time and one part-time person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. The strong innovation movement in Brazil and the desire of civil servants to solve public problems have contributed to its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

*   **Time and Resources**: [[Implementing behavioral insights in public policy | Building Behavioral Science into government work]] takes significant time and more resources than initially expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. There are no shortcuts; each country must adapt principles to its own context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.
*   **Internal Work**: It is crucial to work from the inside to understand internal processes and key moments for intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
*   **Communication**: Constant communication about what [[behavioral science in public governance | Behavioral Science]] teams do, with whom, and the value they add is vital for building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>. Regular updates and engagement can popularize the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.
*   **Collaboration, not Consultation**: Success comes from working *with* policy makers and civil servants, not just for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>. Involving teams and civil servants in the process is transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>.
*   **Subtlety vs. Scalability**: While [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]] can be very subtle in its design, government organizations often struggle with implementing subtle interventions at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. It's important to design interventions that are effective but also scalable within existing government systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.
*   **Learning from Others**: New teams can learn from the experiences and mistakes of more experienced teams, particularly regarding non-technical and political issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:44">[00:55:44]</a>.

The "Logic" principles, agreed upon by the global community, can be used as a diagnostic tool to help governments analyze their capacity in applied [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science]], compare to global benchmarks, and receive tailored advice on improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

The public sector faces increasingly complex and uncertain challenges, highlighting the need for systemic innovation efforts within [[Multistakeholder engagement in innovation ecosystems | ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. These challenges, such as global crises and climate change, require more or different types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Role of Innovation Portfolios in Ecosystems

Innovation portfolios are essential for managing innovation in the public sector, especially in recovery work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Unlike private sector portfolios that often have a single financial bottom line, public sector portfolios focus on public value and impact, which are notoriously difficult to measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Key aspects of innovation portfolios in public sector ecosystems include:
*   **Systemic Approach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>: Innovation efforts should work more systemically, with public sector organizations shaping these efforts within [[Multistakeholder engagement in innovation ecosystems | ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Addressing Complexity and Uncertainty** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>: Portfolio approaches are effective mechanisms for handling the extreme complexity and uncertainty inherent in public sector challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Learning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>: They create a space for accelerated learning and the deliberate deployment of innovation, fostering an experimental and experiential learning approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **[[Cocreation with stakeholders | Co-development and Involvement]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>: Portfolios frame a space for [[Cocreation with stakeholders | co-development]] and genuine involvement of local actors and stakeholders, moving beyond mere consultation to [[Cocreation with stakeholders | co-action and co-determination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Decision Support** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>: They create decision-making spaces and provide experiential intelligence for policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Opening Options** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>: Portfolio approaches can "open up options" for public bodies that previously felt they had none, acting as a multiplier by injecting a learning approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Multilevel and Multi-Sector Collaboration
Innovation portfolios often involve [[multilevel_governance_and_collaboration_in_urban_policymaking | multi-level governance]] and [[multilevel_governance_and_collaboration_in_urban_policymaking | cross-city efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. They can also focus on missions involving [[Multistakeholder engagement in innovation ecosystems | multi-sector ecosystems]] around a single goal, like carbon neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For example, a [[Publicprivate sector collaboration | public-private body]] working on climate change addresses complex challenges like decarbonization and adaptation involving economies, infrastructure, and societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

A portfolio approach for a city might involve hundreds of innovation initiatives simultaneously, addressing various systems like social, economic, infrastructure, and environmental aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. This requires deliberately constructing a framework for systemic approaches and orchestrating relationships among many different interventions across sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

### [[Engaging stakeholders in innovation | Engaging Stakeholders]] and Building Intent
Successful implementation of portfolio approaches in the public sector involves:
1.  **Acknowledging the Implementation Gap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>: Recognizing the gap between policy commitments and individual innovations, and that "joining the dots" between diverse interventions doesn't happen automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
2.  **Agreeing on Intent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>: Rather than rigid objectives, a common, shared commitment and vision for transformation is needed, acknowledging that the precise destination is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. This requires sufficient actors to be part of the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. This commitment can ideally be converted into policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
3.  **Visual and Contextual Framing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>: Creating a visual, contextual, and systemic frame helps people see how disparate initiatives (e.g., transport, community gardens, aging population healthcare) relate to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. This helps resist the "gravitational pull" to immediately find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.
4.  **Building Flexibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>: Deliberately creating budgets of flexibility and legitimizing the idea that complexity is a feature, not a bug, allows for greater possibilities and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
5.  **Systematic Sense-Making** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>: A portfolio approach thrives when combined with systematic sense-making, extracting learning from multiple initiatives, and turning it into narratives, stories, and actionable intelligence for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Poll Results
> Participants identified "looking for relationships, connections, and combinations among diverse innovation initiatives" as the most important facilitating element for successful portfolio approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Closely tied was the "recognition of complexity and uncertainty in addressing change" and "keeping options open to iterate and learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

## Challenges and Strategies for Funding Multistakeholder Initiatives

One of the significant [[Challenges and strategies for global collaboration | challenges]] is adapting funding models to support portfolio approaches in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.
*   **Project- vs. Portfolio-based Funding**: Public and private money often seeks individual projects and "bankable assets," making it difficult to fund portfolio-level initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion**: In contexts of rising debt and reduced resources, there's a natural tendency towards more accountability and restriction, which contradicts the openness needed for portfolio approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Need for New Instruments**: There is a need for new financial instruments and a different "intent" for capital that is suitable for continuous discovery and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.

### Strategies for Funding
*   **Prototyping New Systems**: It's crucial to find organizations and partners willing to prototype new financial instruments and systems within government, while still operating under the constraints of current systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **Transformational Capital**: Structuring investment vehicles to enable investment in the portfolio itself, rather than just individual projects, can unlock funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>. This means investors place money into the capacity of the portfolio to induce effects and open possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.
*   **Impact Logic**: A robust "impact logic" or heuristic can demonstrate how funding meets multiple concerns (e.g., emissions, adaptation, social cohesion), helping to structure qualitative outcomes, learning, and discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.

> [!INFO] Call to Action
> There's an open invitation for anyone interested in building different ways of structuring and deploying funding for portfolios to engage in discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

## Shifting Roles in Public Sector Innovation

The concept of a "portfolio manager" is distinct from a "project manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Steward/Curator**: This role is more akin to a "gardener" or "orchestrator," not a director dictating strict plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>. They act as an "editor," combining and connecting disparate initiatives to create coherence and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.
*   **Facilitator of Intent**: This role involves differentiating between rigid objectives and overarching intent, creating space for discussions about shared purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. This challenges the traditional identity of organizations as "solution providers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.
*   **Building Shared Mental Models**: It's a social process of creating a shared understanding that can hold an organization together even when unexpected events occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

### [[Role of public bodies in steering ecosystems | Role of Public Bodies]] in Steering Ecosystems
Governments are ultimately responsible for societal challenges, yet unilateral action is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.
*   **Coherence between Problem and Solution**: The scale of fundamental societal change requires broad engagement coherent with that scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.
*   **Governments as Ecosystem Representatives**: Governments can be seen as representations of how society is structured. The focus should be on enabling public bodies to invest in capability building and mindset shifts to embrace roles as:
    *   **Challenge Owners**: Holding long-term accountability across political cycles and generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.
    *   **Orchestrators**: Proficiently joining dots, bridging, convening, connecting, and facilitating across multiple actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>.
    *   **Activists and Advocates**: Representing diverse interests that need to be braided into whole-system change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>.
*   **Narrative and Vision**: A compelling narrative and vision (shared mental model) that is big enough, pragmatic enough, and close to a sense of self can mobilize multiple entities to find common ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.
*   **Radical Collaboration**: Explicitly designing for and rewarding [[Multilevel governance and collaboration in urban policymaking | radical collaboration]] is crucial, both within public bodies and across different levels of decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.
*   **Technology as an Enabler**: Technology, especially AI, should be designed to help look across relationships and foster radical collaboration across ecosystems, rather than contributing to siloed effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.

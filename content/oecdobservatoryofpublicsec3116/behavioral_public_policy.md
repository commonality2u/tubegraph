[[Behavioral public policy | Behavioral public policy]] refers to the use of [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] evidence to inform policymaking [07:44:02]. It helps governments and policymakers analyze challenges, design effective solutions, and allocate resources to policies with the highest chance of success [07:22:04]. This approach recognizes the central role of citizen and consumer behavior in policy work [07:32:41].

## Origin and Growth of [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral Science in Policy Making]]

The journey of embedding [[Behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science in policy making]] globally began notably when the UK government established the first behavioral insights unit in 2010 [00:39:27]. Since then, much has been learned about effective and ineffective methods for integrating [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science in public governance]] and government operations [00:48:65].

Many governments worldwide seek support from the OECD to establish [[mainstreaming_behavioral_science_in_government | behavioral science functions]] within their administrations [00:27:30]. There are now over 300 institutions globally applying [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science in policy making]] [03:36:13]. The growth has been observed in two directions:
*   **Broadening** - A wider range of countries are setting up [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science functions]] [03:48:98].
*   **Deepening** - Many countries now have multiple teams and functions across various public administrations [03:56:56].

Growth in this field has been accelerating, with over half of new teams created since 2019 [04:31:07]. This trend was likely intensified by COVID-19, which presented inherently behavioral problems, particularly before vaccine availability [04:45:90]. Different governance arrangements are observed across countries, including dedicated units in central government, specific functions in line agencies, dispersed expertise, or ad-hoc expertise from outside government [04:56:56].

The OECD monitors this growth and diversity using a mixed-method approach, including surveys (2020, 2021, 2023), semi-structured interviews with senior practitioners, regular interactions with its network of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science experts]], and an online map where new teams can register [05:26:09].

## The "Logic" Report: Good Practice Principles for [[Mainstreaming behavioral science in government | Mainstreaming Behavioral Public Policy]]

The OECD's latest report, "Logic: Good Practice Principles for [[Mainstreaming behavioral science in government | Mainstreaming Behavioral Public Policy]]", provides guidance and builds capacity within government for [[behavioral science in public governance | behavioral science in public governance]] [00:16:08, 03:25:05].

Logic aims to answer questions such as how to set up a [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science function]] in government, what the best governance models are, and how to ensure the impact and sustainability of behavioral functions over time [00:57:33]. It is based on several years of rigorous research, combining data from governments worldwide with insights from [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science experts]] [01:26:67]. This mix of evidence and experience helped identify the most effective principles for [[mainstreaming_behavioral_science_in_government | mainstreaming behavioral science in public policies]] [01:39:69].

The principles are designed to serve both those new to using [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] and those looking to deepen and expand existing impact [01:46:17].

## OECD's Work Dimensions on [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral Science]]

The OECD's work on [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] has three main dimensions [02:58:61]:
*   **Convene** - Bringing together a global network of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science experts]] [03:06:51].
*   **Enable** - Supporting governments in using [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] [03:11:51].
*   **Advise** - Guiding governments on policy challenges, often by generating new evidence through policy experiments [03:14:48]. The work on "Logic" falls under the "enable" dimension [03:22:92].

## Challenges in [[Implementing behavioral insights in public policy | Implementing Behavioral Insights in Public Policy]]

Despite the growth of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] applications, practitioners still face a variety of challenges, primarily related to institutional factors and the relationship between [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] teams and their organizations [06:05:78]. Counterintuitively, older and more mature teams often report more challenges, possibly because they encounter different situations over time and develop strategies to address them [06:29:43]. The "Logic" report leverages collective knowledge to identify good practices for [[mainstreaming_behavioral_science_in_government | mainstreaming behavioral public policy]] and overcoming these challenges [06:42:37].

## [[Behavioral Public Policy]] Across the Policy Cycle

[[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] can contribute to each phase of the policy cycle [07:53:14]:
*   **Problem Identification** - Helps identify and prioritize societal challenges where people's actions are counter to their or society's long-term interests (e.g., unhealthy food choices, not utilizing government programs) [07:59:04].
*   **Problem Analysis** - Aids in understanding the drivers and barriers of behavior within a social system, which informs policy design to address these barriers [08:15:06]. This is a significant growth area for [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] [08:31:01].
*   **Policy Assessment** - Provides tools like Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and pilot testing to de-risk policy implementation [08:39:06].
*   **Policy Implementation** - The most traditional use of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]], helping policymakers decide how a policy should be implemented, optimize existing programs, maximize impact, and ensure intended outcomes [08:51:00].
*   **Policy Monitoring and Evaluation** - Supports monitoring implementation actions and evaluating policies to address key issues in subsequent problem identification [09:11:00].

## The "Logic" Principles

The "Logic" framework categorizes 14 good practice principles into five dimensions [09:30:26]:

### Leadership
*   **P1: Senior leaders request and advocate for [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] where relevant.** Actions and words of influential leaders are critical for encouraging the uptake of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] [10:38:00]. When senior government leaders advocate for a people-centered approach and robust evidence, the use of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] increases [10:44:00]. An example is the recent U.S. federal government executive order promoting social and [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral sciences]] for federal policies and programs [10:57:00].
*   **P2: Senior leaders' support for [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] is maintained over time.** This is the responsibility of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] managers through regular briefings and engagement at all levels [11:21:00].

### Objectives
*   **P3: Governments include [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] in strategic plans and monitor its use over time.** This can involve formally defining [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] and its relation to government strategic goals [11:35:00].
*   **P4: The impact of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] is monitored.** It is important to assess [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] as a tool to ensure it achieves its goals [12:08:00]. The Netherlands, for example, reports to Parliament every two years on the use of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]], including case studies [12:17:00].
*   **P5: [[Behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] is used in designing and improving internal organizational processes, rules, and incentives.** This is another growth area, with more countries applying [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to their own internal policies and programs, leading to more effective public administration [12:37:00].

### Governance
*   **P6: Senior leaders clearly allocate responsibility for [[mainstreaming_behavioral_science_in_government | mainstreaming behavioral science]] and establish lines of accountability.** A clear accountability structure helps efficiently embed [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] into policymaking [13:01:00]. This can be a single senior executive or a team responsible for [[mainstreaming_behavioral_science_in_government | mainstreaming behavioral science]] across government [13:18:00].
*   **P7: Senior leaders and managers mobilize sufficient resources to ensure policy advice is informed by relevant and reliable [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] evidence.** Once accountability is established, the responsible team should be efficiently resourced [13:38:00]. Resources can be placed across various areas of public administration [13:59:00].

### Integration
*   **P8: Managers integrate [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] into standard guidelines and procedures for policy development, implementation, and evaluation.** This creates an enabling environment for [[Behavioral public policy | behavioral public policy]] [14:09:00]. Examples include creating templates where [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] is part of the analysis process for policy or program proposals [14:35:00].
*   **P9: Managers ensure that [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] is applied responsibly, openly, and with high integrity standards to build and maintain policymakers' and citizens' trust.** Maintaining trust is crucial for the work to be conducted [14:53:00]. Upholding high ethical and research standards is key [15:13:00].
*   **P10: Managers support processes and structures for data collection and analysis that make it easier to diagnose behavioral issues and evaluate policy options.** This ties into the policy cycle, allowing for easy problem identification and assessment of policy options [15:24:00]. In Canada, the [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] team in the Privy Council Office conducts ongoing research on climate change, helping understand how Canadians feel and behave regarding climate-related issues [15:51:00, 16:00:00].

### Capability
*   **P11: Managers build policymakers' capability to apply [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to their work.** [[behavioral science in policy making | Behavioral science]] literacy should be built as broadly as possible within government, not just within dedicated units, so people can identify where it can be useful [16:29:00].
*   **P12: Managers develop sustainable ways for policymakers to access [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] expertise.** When advanced techniques are needed, policymakers should be able to access experts [16:58:00].
*   **P13: Managers ensure that [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] evidence can be useful to inform policymaking processes through quality brokerage.** This involves [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science experts]] acting more as advisors than just researchers [17:17:00]. Some individuals in [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] units may focus on this brokerage function, seeking and ensuring application of evidence [17:41:00].
*   **P14: Managers build mechanisms for dissemination and knowledge sharing, such as networks of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science experts]] and supporters.** This ensures sustained buy-in and growth within the community [17:58:00].

## Country Experiences

### Finland
Finland's journey in embedding [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] began around 2013 with government collaborations and an experimentation culture, including the widely reported basic income experiment in 2017 [02:39:00]. A significant turning point occurred in October 2020, during the COVID-19 crisis, when Finland benchmarked other countries' use of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] and initiated a six-month pilot project [02:47:00]. This pilot advised the communications team, providing crucial help during the pandemic for messaging on masks and vaccinations [02:51:00].

The project continued and expanded into various central government ministries and subject areas [02:59:00]. A key turning point was the end of 2021, when a small two-person team in the Prime Minister's Office demonstrated that much could be achieved with limited resources [03:17:00]. Successful initiatives, like text messages to encourage youth voting (an RCT widely reported in media), increased interest and led to a growing network [02:59:00]. The team has now grown to four people, with a fifth joining in September, and is involved in an EU project, indicating a steadily growing scale of work across "every imaginable area" [02:46:00].

The success is attributed to a good team, strong support from the Prime Minister's Office's Strategic Department, and the belief that not using [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] is no longer an option [02:50:00]. The approach is described as "ambitious but humble," focusing on working together with government teams to tackle complex issues rather than simply advising [02:50:00].

### United Kingdom (HMRC & Ofcom)
The UK's [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] efforts gained prominence with the Nudge Unit's first successful trial at HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), demonstrating quantifiable impact [03:49:00]. Initial success was fueled by strong political support from the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, head of the Civil Service, and head of the Tax Authority [03:49:00].

Rupert Gill notes that political support is time-limited, and teams can become vulnerable when senior backers move on [03:40:00]. Instead of fighting the "mainstream" to embed [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] (which often reverts to status quo), the HMRC team found success in "side streams"—areas with more autonomy, like debt management [03:32:00]. In these "silos," they found senior champions, data availability, and the ability to act, measure, and learn [03:50:00]. This allowed for a series of trials on complex debt behaviors, building a robust program of work [03:50:00].

Another turning point was the COVID-19 pandemic, where the HMRC behavioral team had a significant impact on the Furlough scheme [03:07:00]. This was the most thorough and widespread input of behavioral thinking into a policy Rupert had encountered [03:07:00]. This included framing the scheme to provide reassurance, designing a human-centered service for businesses under stress, and influencing guidance, user interface, and even anti-fraud measures [03:07:00].

Factors enabling this success included [03:07:00]:
*   **Novelty:** It was a new scheme with no established norms, creating openness for new ideas and less resistance from the status quo [03:07:00].
*   **Track Record:** The team's established credibility and relationships meant they were trusted to be "at the top table" during critical decisions [03:07:00].
*   **Senior Buy-in:** Rishi Sunak, then Chancellor and now Prime Minister, was "behaviorally astute" and understood the psychological impact of financial support [03:07:00].
*   **Proactivity and Communication:** The behavioral team was opportunistic, knew the organization well, and had proactive, strong communicators who could simplify and convey their value easily in a high-pressure environment [03:07:00].

### Brazil
Brazil's journey with [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] began with isolated experiences, followed by initiatives in cities like Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo [03:35:00]. At the federal level, progress started around 2017 with the National School of Public Administration launching regular [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] courses and publications [03:54:00]. Cláudio Couto, a key figure, developed the "Simplement" method to generate insights for using [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] in public policies [04:12:00]. These initiatives raised awareness and built a critical mass of understanding within the federal administration [04:31:00].

The main turning point occurred in 2023 with the inception of Cinco, Brazil's first [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] unit, established in a new Ministry focused on Management and Innovation in Public Services [04:49:00]. This is significant for Latin America, fostering regional collaboration [04:49:00]. The Ministry's transversal policies (procurement, human resources, digital services) align well with Cinco's mission to improve public policy and society's life [04:49:00]. The new government structure under Lula's inauguration, with the first Innovation Ministry in Brazil, provided the opportune moment [04:49:00].

Marara Camões's advocacy, based on her experience using [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] in the Genova Innovation Lab, was instrumental in creating Cinco [04:49:00]. The unit was granted special power to recruit civil servants from various federal organizations, forming a diverse team of 15 full-time and one part-time person with backgrounds from federal universities, regulatory agencies, and control offices [04:49:00]. This diversity is crucial for their projects, which include research, communication, and partnerships [04:49:00].

Cinco emphasizes a collaborative approach, working *with* policymakers to develop solutions rather than acting as external consultants [04:49:00]. This aims to foster a sense of shared ownership [04:49:00]. The success is partly attributed to a strong innovation movement in Brazil and the high engagement of civil servants who believe in solving public problems and helping society through [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral insights]] [04:49:00]. There is high demand for this work, evidenced by numerous applications to join Cinco [04:49:00].

An example of their current work involves addressing dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases, a major problem in Brazil [04:49:00]. Traditional campaigns have failed for 30 years, as the issue is inherently behavioral (e.g., cleaning water in houses) [04:49:00]. Cinco is now participating in drafting a new communication plan, highlighting how [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral insights]] can offer "new possibilities" for old, persistent problems [04:49:00].

## Key Lessons Learned

*   **Time and Resources:** Building [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral sciences]] into government work takes significant time and resources, with no shortcuts [05:29:00]. Each country's context and systems are different, requiring internal, observant work to understand what processes and timing are useful [05:50:00].
*   **Communication and Trust:** Effective communication is crucial, especially in the beginning, to inform people about the team's work, build trust, and gain wider government support [05:33:00]. Regular engagement (e.g., coffee mornings, research presentations, reports) helps maintain visibility and foster inclusion [05:59:00].
*   **Collaboration:** Working *with* civil servants and involving teams in the process is transformative, going beyond just providing solutions to empowering people to see how they can make a difference [05:32:00].
*   **Scalability vs. Subtlety:** While [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] can design subtle, carefully tailored interventions, government organizations often struggle with this at scale [05:56:00]. The subtlety of the intervention can be lost in large-scale implementation unless there is continuous advocacy [05:56:00]. It's important to design interventions that are impactful but not overly complex for government systems [05:56:00].
*   **Learning and Adaptability:** New teams can learn significantly from the experiences and mistakes of more mature teams [05:55:00]. Dealing with non-technical and political issues is an important part of applying [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] in real-world policy contexts [05:56:00]. Building bridges and fostering collaboration among different experts is essential, especially with limited budgets [05:56:00].

## Future Applications of "Logic"

The OECD intends to use the "Logic" principles to conduct peer reviews for countries, similar to their existing reviews on public governance [05:39:00]. These reviews would assess how a country organizes and manages its use of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] to improve policies, services, and internal administration [05:58:00]. Such reviews could help countries:
*   Understand how they compare to global benchmarks of best practices [05:58:00].
*   Receive practical advice on improvements [05:58:00].
*   Set up new [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science functions]] [05:58:00].
*   Transform or refine existing functions [05:58:00].

The "Logic" framework allows for assessing maturity across different dimensions, such as leadership, objectives, and integration [05:58:00]. For instance, a country might excel in leadership but have room for improvement in integration [05:58:00]. This diagnostic tool aims to help governments worldwide improve their application of [[behavioral science in policy making | behavioral science]] [05:58:00].

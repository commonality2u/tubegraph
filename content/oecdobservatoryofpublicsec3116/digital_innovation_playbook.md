The **Digital Innovation Playbook** is a new digital tool developed to translate the OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation into practical application, aiming to bridge the gap between good intentions and actual implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This initial demo version is being presented for the first time to offer a glimpse into its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

The Playbook was co-created by diverse countries, with 12 countries initially engaged in its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Key contributors include Bruno Mon, Policy Analyst at the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), and Cla Carr, Comms Leader at OPSI, who was critical in making the tool accessible and visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Foundation: OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation

The Playbook is based on the OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation, a high-level instrument providing guidance to governments on how to steer and promote innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Created over five years ago, 43 countries have already adhered to this Declaration, signifying its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The Declaration outlines five core principles:
*   **Embrace and Embed Innovation within the Public Sector** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>: This includes providing high-level sponsorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Encourage and Equip All Public Servants to Innovate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>: Ensuring skills and incentives are in place for all public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Cultivate New Partnerships and Involve Different Voices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>: Going beyond government walls to leverage the wisdom and motivation of [[Innovation Ecosystems | ecosystem stakeholders]] and ensuring inclusivity in innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Support Exploration, Iteration, and Testing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>: Testing before implementing, learning from errors, and managing risks in controlled environments using robust methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Diffuse Lessons and Share Practices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>: Building on the understanding that innovation is sharable and built in partnership, promoting learning from others to improve activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## How the Playbook Works

The Playbook provides a simple three-step journey to apply these principles:
1.  **Frame the Challenge**: Clearly define the problem you want to solve, translating it into specific challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
2.  **Take Stock**: Assess your current standing, identifying areas of strength and those needing improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
3.  **Apply and Adapt**: Utilize the collective intelligence of use cases, [[innovation_tools_and_methods | tools]], and actions contributed by co-creators, adapting them to your specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Key Characteristics and Goals

The developers aimed for the Playbook to be:
*   **Accessible**: Users can directly jump in and start applying it without extensive instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Actionable**: It's designed to facilitate concrete interventions rather than just being an archival resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **User-Centric**: Actual users were engaged in its co-creation and co-design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Adaptable**: It can be adjusted to different contexts of use through experimentation and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Connective**: It aims to build connections among users and integrate with other existing resources of the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, such as the Case Study Library and the [[toolkit_for_anticipatory_innovation | Toolkit Navigator]], offering a single point of entry to a galaxy of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Development and Co-creation Journey

The Playbook's development involved several iterations:
1.  **Mockup**: Initially, a simple Word document was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
2.  **First Iteration**: This version expanded to include more [[innovation_tools_and_methods | tools]] and cases, based on community suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
3.  **Final Version**: This consolidated version was tested and is now available in English and other national languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

The co-creation process was seen as an experiment itself, revealing common challenges across countries and fostering determination and resilience among participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

## Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Package

Alongside the Playbook, a "Do-It-Yourself" package has been created to maximize its utility:
*   **Tutorial Video**: A 90-second introduction on how to use and apply the Playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Interactive Mural Board**: A digital environment for teams to apply the Playbook collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **In-Person Version**: Materials provided for running traditional in-person workshops, which can be translated and adapted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Feedback Channel**: A mechanism for users to share their experiences, difficulties, and limitations, which helps identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Impact and Application Examples

The Playbook has been applied in various ways across different countries:
*   **Sweden (Vinnova)**: Jonas Gumbal and his team were the first to translate the Playbook into Swedish and adapt it for in-person workshops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. They found that localization was crucial for wider use and simplified the material to fit the Swedish audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. For Sweden, the Declaration and Playbook provide legitimacy and a potential guide for achieving [[government_innovation_strategies | government innovation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Prototyping and user feedback were key to its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Romania (Innovation Lab)**: Anca Pesco and Larissa Balak's team translated the Playbook into Romanian and used it to introduce the concept of public sector innovation, which was new to the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. It has been critical in building their emerging community of innovators and raising awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. They envision using it to structure future [[government_innovation_strategies | strategies]] and action plans and integrating it into a new platform for interactions between public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Chile (Laboratorio de Gobierno)**: Orlando Hus, Director of the Government Lab in Chile, highlights the Declaration and Playbook as providing a common understanding of public innovation and a clear model of principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>. The lab's services, such as agile consultancy (focused on exploration, iteration, testing) and cultivating partnerships, are directly aligned with the Declaration's principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. Chile has developed a Public Innovators Network (28,000+ members) and a Public Innovation School for skills development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. They also use a Public Innovation Index to measure public service innovation capabilities and identify gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. This index, developed with the Inter-American Development Bank in 2019, measures 10 capabilities including structure, [[digital_transformation_and_legal_frameworks | legal framework]], skills, digital capabilities, openness, and established processes for innovation and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. Efforts are underway to extend this index to other Latin American countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

The Playbook has also been applied beyond internal projects, facilitating structured conversations among different departments within an organization, and even enabling dialogues between countries (e.g., Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) to identify shared challenges and foster cross-border collaboration in public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.

## Evolution to Digital Version

The move to a digital version was motivated by several insights and feedback:
*   **Engaging, Playful, Interactive**: A demand for a more dynamic user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>.
*   **Cross-linkages**: To highlight existing resources and make them accessible from a single point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.
*   **Updatable and Manageable**: To streamline updates and avoid the need for new PDF versions with every change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
*   **Accessibility (Anytime, Anywhere)**: To ensure users can access the tool regardless of their location or time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   **Automated Results**: To automatically systematize and export the results of user interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>.

Countries like Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Luxembourg, Spain, and Sweden joined to explore and support the development of this new interactive, updatable digital version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

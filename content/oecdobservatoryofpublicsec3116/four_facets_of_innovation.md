## What is Public Sector Innovation?

Public sector innovation is defined as something novel in its context that is implemented and brings about a shift in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. An innovation can vary in size (big or small) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, and the process of innovating can be more or less certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It can emerge in a directed, top-down way or from a bottom-up, undirected approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The OECD Public Sector Innovation Model

Recognizing the multifaceted nature of public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation developed a [[innovation_facets_model | public sector innovation model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This model is based on two core features of innovation:
*   How directed it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   How uncertain the process is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>

From these axes, four distinct [[innovation_facets_model | facets of innovation]] emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:

### 1. Enhancement-Oriented Innovation
This type of innovation aims to make existing products, services, and processes more effective and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Example:** Using [[behavioral_insights_in_innovation | behavioural insights]] to encourage people to pay their taxes on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### 2. Mission-Oriented Innovation
This facet focuses on solving specific problems and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Examples:**
    *   The historical effort to send humans to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
    *   Current initiatives to switch to sustainable energy to counteract climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### 3. Anticipatory Innovation
Anticipatory innovation seeks to influence future developments before they become fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Example:** Exploring the ethical and technological boundaries that artificial intelligence projects should adhere to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### 4. Adaptive Innovation
[[understanding_adaptive_innovation | Adaptive innovation]] is the exploration of what is possible, representing the [[the_discovery_process_in_innovation | process of discovery]] of what could be or might be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Example:** Social media has introduced new ways for government and citizens to interact, reshaping citizen expectations and creating new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Importance of a Balanced Innovation Portfolio

Since innovation is multifaceted, there isn't a single, one-size-fits-all approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Concentrating on only one or two [[innovation_facets_model | facets]] can lead to uneven innovation efforts and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Therefore, governments require a balanced innovation portfolio that covers all [[innovation_facets_model | innovation facets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

The public sector faces significant [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | challenges and opportunities in public sector innovation]] as it strives to adapt to an evolving world. A recent report, based on work with Canada, explores the intricate system of [[innovation in government | innovation]] within the public sector, aiming to foster a more consistent and deliberate approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Canada's Journey in Government Innovation

Canada has a long-standing interest and articulated ambition for [[innovation in government | innovation]] within its public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Despite this, there has been an ongoing struggle to find the right balance between control and allowing for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. [[innovation in government | Innovation]] is inherently difficult, and no government globally has fully mastered it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. While innovation has occurred in the Canadian public service, it has often been ad-hoc and reactive rather than a consistent, deliberate, and reliable resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The need for consistent innovation stems from several factors:
*   Governments must change in an environment of constant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   Governments must adapt policies to maintain service outcomes in an evolving economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   [[innovation in government | Innovation]] requires active participation and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   Public servants, citizens, and governments expect things to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   A government that fails to innovate risks falling behind and disappointing its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Therefore, [[innovation in government | innovation]] needs to become a core competency and a systemic, repeatable, and consistent activity, rather than merely a reaction to circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Understanding the Innovation System

To achieve systemic [[innovation in government | innovation]], it is crucial to understand the underlying [[innovation in government | innovation system]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. An [[innovation in government | innovation system]] encompasses the factors, components, and practices that influence whether and to what extent innovation occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The existing system needs to be understood through its history, learned lessons, current achievements, and the lived experiences of those within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Key Findings from the Canadian Context

A design-led process involving interviews and workshops revealed four core understandings about the [[innovation in government | innovation system]] in Canada:
1.  **Uncertain Relationship with Innovation:** Despite increased attention, the public service remains unsure of its role, expectations, and the purpose of [[innovation in government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. This fragmented understanding of "who, what, and why" makes it secondary to clearer agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
2.  **Reliance on Individuals:** [[innovation in government | Innovation]] often happens due to determined individuals or as a byproduct of other processes, rather than based on the merit of ideas or a strategic need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This reliance on "the right person in the right place at the right time" or "a bit of luck" is not ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
3.  **Mismatch with External Dynamics:** The public service is not always well-equipped to leverage innovative options, leading to a mismatch between internal capabilities and external expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Feedback loops tend to favor clearly understood options over emergent ones, risking disappointment if external demands shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
4.  **Marginalized Practice:** While the practice of [[innovation in government | innovation]] has evolved, it largely remains a "side of desk" or marginal activity, not integrated into the core business of the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. It is often seen as exceptional rather than routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## Determinants of Innovation in the Public Sector

These understandings led to a model identifying three levels of analysis for [[innovation in government | innovation]]: individual, organizational, and systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. If system-level elements are absent, the burden falls to organizations, and if organizational elements are lacking, it relies on individuals, making [[innovation in government | innovation]] unsustainable as it requires exceptional effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

The model proposes four key determinants of [[innovation in government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>:

1.  **Clarity:**
    *   **Description:** There must be a clear signal at the system level for why [[innovation in government | innovation]] is wanted and needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. In the private sector, this signal is profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>; in the public sector, it is politics, which can be noisy and changeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. Without clarity, [[innovation in government | innovation]] will always come second to clearer agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
    *   **Opportunities for Intervention:**
        *   Building shared understanding of what [[innovation in government | innovation]] means (e.g., Denmark's Innovation Barometer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
        *   Setting clear appetite and expectation (e.g., France's manifesto on public sector innovation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
        *   Articulating roles within the [[innovation in government | innovation system]] (e.g., Denmark's innovation archetypes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.
        *   Connecting [[innovation in government | innovation]] to the shared history and context of the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.
    *   **Prompting Question:** Do external system actors have a clear sense of what the public service means by [[innovation in government | innovation]], where it is sought, and how they can contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>?

2.  **Parity:**
    *   **Description:** [[innovation in government | Innovation]] must have equal standing with other considerations when proposing actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. In the private sector, a marketplace for ideas and the threat of competition ensure ideas get consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. In the public sector, new ideas often face incumbent forces without a threat of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.
    *   **Opportunities for Intervention:** Ensuring processes are open to challenge, bottlenecks can be circumvented, allies can be found, and risk and uncertainty can be navigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.

3.  **Suitability:**
    *   **Description:** Capability systems and infrastructure must be appropriate and sufficient for available innovative options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. Public sector feedback loops favor what is already understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. Waiting until something is fully understood makes government a "taker" rather than a "shaper," reducing its absorptive capacity for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
    *   **Opportunities for Intervention:**
        *   Learning from and keeping pace with external change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.
        *   Socializing technology within the public service and exposing leaders to new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.
        *   Exploring new operational models (e.g., Canada's Talent Cloud) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.
        *   Keeping track of changing expectations from citizens and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.

4.  **Normality:**
    *   **Description:** [[innovation in government | Innovation]] must be seen as integral to core business, not an occasional deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. In the private sector, profitability normalizes new practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. In the public sector, innovation is too often seen as exceptional or a "frolic," making it hard to embed as routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
    *   **Opportunities for Intervention:**
        *   Establishing clear behaviors that support innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.
        *   Linking innovation to regular business activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.
        *   Socializing and celebrating innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
        *   Upholding and defending innovation practices, especially when experiments fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.

These four determinants are interdependent; for example, without clarity, achieving parity is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. A system's performance is limited by its weakest part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. In the Canadian context, clarity is observed as a keystone element due to a strong demand for understanding mandates and permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges in Government Innovation

### Overcoming Risk Aversion
Public services globally exhibit risk aversion, which is a structural issue rather than solely contextual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. The challenge is not to eliminate risk but to balance it by increasing the perceived risk of *not* innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. Initiatives like Canada's experimentation direction and commitment help normalize risk-taking by making experimenting an expected activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>.

Key strategies include:
*   **Leveraging Declarations:** Documents like Canada's FPT Declaration on Public Sector Innovation provide tacit approval for public servants to explore and do things differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Outcomes, Not Activities:** Shifting from measuring activities to measuring actual outcomes reduces risk, as payment is tied to achieving desired impacts (e.g., "pay on outcomes") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.
*   **Challenging Conventions:** Often, the system operates by convention rather than foundational policies. Public servants should refer to original policies and guidelines that typically offer more flexibility than current practices suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

### Balancing Top-Down and Grassroots Efforts
A balanced approach is needed for fostering [[innovation in government | innovation]], integrating top-down direction with grassroots efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. In large, complex, and changeable systems, command-and-control responses are limited; thus, people at all levels need the capacity to engage with innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. Public servants should recognize their existing remit for change and pursue it, as leaders may already have given permission for new initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. Storytelling is also crucial for bridging gaps, tailoring narratives to resonate with different management levels and their specific concerns (e.g., risk, communication, policy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:57">[01:24:57]</a>.

### Addressing the "Clay Layer" (Middle Management)
Frustration with middle management, often dubbed the "clay layer," is a universal issue in hierarchical organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:53">[01:22:53]</a>. Middle managers play a vital role in filtering information but may not always be in a position to absorb new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a>. Solutions include creating forums for people to circulate, share, and develop ideas to a more sophisticated level before requiring managerial attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>. Platforms like GCconnects and GCcollab in Canada are examples of such forums for finding allies and developing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>.

### Responding to Disruptive Change
Disruptive technologies like blockchain and AI pose significant policy challenges for governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. Governments must rethink their role in the [[innovation in government | innovation system]] to become anticipatory rather than reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:59">[01:15:59]</a>.

In Canada, a Deputy Minister Task Force on public sector innovation focuses on:
*   **Core Systems Transformation:** Examining areas like grants, human resources, and procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.
*   **Experimenting with Disruptive Technologies:** Exploring AI and blockchain to learn how to adapt and adopt them into government operations for greater efficiency and risk-savviness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>. Examples include experimenting with blockchain for digital identity management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a> and AI for translation services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>.
*   **Data Strategy:** A robust data strategy is foundational for effectively utilizing disruptive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding the [[innovation in government | innovation system]] is a continuous learning process. The aim is to make the implicit explicit, empowering individuals within the system to see themselves as shapers rather than subjects of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a>. By understanding the determinants of innovation—Clarity, Parity, Suitability, and Normality—governments can identify points of intervention to nudge and guide the system towards more consistent and impactful innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>.

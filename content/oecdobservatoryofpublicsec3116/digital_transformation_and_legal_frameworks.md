The COVID-19 crisis has significantly accelerated the [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]] of public services and highlighted the critical need to adapt legal frameworks to support this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This involves addressing existing legal barriers and proactively preparing for future technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

## Legal Barriers to Digitalization

For a long time, discussions have taken place about digital or legal barriers to [[digital_transformation_in_government | digitalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid action to identify and change laws that hindered [[digital_transformation_of_public_services | digital transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

Examples of such outdated legal requirements include:
*   **Physical Meetings**: Laws stipulating the need for a physical meeting, rather than simply a meeting, which is problematic when remote interaction becomes necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
*   **Physical Signatures**: Requirements for a physical signature when a digital signature would be equally effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

## Necessity for Technology-Neutral and AI-Ready Laws

A key focus for legal framework reform is to make laws "technology-neutral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. This means ensuring that legal provisions do not implicitly or explicitly favor older technologies or methods, allowing for the adoption of new digital solutions without constant legislative updates.

Furthermore, there is a recognized need for "machine or AI-ready laws and regulations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. This anticipates a future where artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies play a greater role in governance and public service delivery, requiring a legal framework that can accommodate and govern these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

> [!TIP] Goal of Legal Reform
> The overall aim is to ensure that the legal framework does not impede [[challenges_and_opportunities_of_digital_transformation | innovation]] and [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | digitalization]] in the years to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

## Impact of Crisis on Legal Frameworks and Innovation

The COVID-19 crisis has acted as a catalyst, accelerating the need to break down silos and embrace innovation quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. This has led to faster adoption of measures that governments had aspired to implement for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

For instance, online consultations with health services, which were not widely adopted before the pandemic, have seen a significant surge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. This shift is expected to continue post-crisis due to its efficiency for both citizens and health services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

## Elements Supporting Digital Transformation and Legal Adaptation

Successful [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | public sector transformation]], including the adaptation of legal frameworks, relies on three core elements:
1.  **Culture**: Fostering a culture that encourages thinking outside the box, challenging existing methods, and allowing for new ideas and a degree of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. While public sector failure with taxpayer money is generally not accepted, some allowance for experimentation is necessary for true [[challenges_and_opportunities_of_digital_transformation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
2.  **Leadership**: Leaders who inspire a culture of [[agile_and_digital_transformation_in_government | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
3.  **Competence**: Ensuring the necessary skills and expertise are available to implement and follow through on innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. This often requires close cooperation between national and municipal levels, especially for smaller municipalities lacking resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

## Coordinated Approach to Digitalization

Norway has developed a new strategy for the [[digital_transformation_of_public_services | digitalization of the public sector]] in collaboration with municipal levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. This joint approach recognizes that public services must be seamless across governmental levels, as citizens care more about receiving a good quality service efficiently than which specific level of government provides it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

Prioritizing the digitalization of "life events" (e.g., having a child, which involves over 60 different actors) requires cooperation not only between municipal and national levels but also with other relevant stakeholders for a holistic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. This cross-sectoral collaboration is crucial for effective [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | digital transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.

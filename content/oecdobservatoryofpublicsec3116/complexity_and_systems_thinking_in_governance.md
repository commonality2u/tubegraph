Governments worldwide face an acute need to respond to emerging and widespread challenges such as pandemics, climate change, migration, and rapidly developing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. In this environment, [[complexity_in_governance | complex systems]] and their inherent problems have become the norm rather than the exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. Despite governments often being good at reacting quickly and efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>, a purely reactive approach to policymaking is increasingly inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

## The Need for Proactive Governance
Instead of waiting for a crisis to strike, governments need to be proactive, anticipating and responding innovatively before issues fully emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>. This requires not only the ability to respond to unforeseen challenges expediently and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>, but also to anticipate different futures and prepare for these realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>.

### Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG)
Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG) is proposed as a crucial framework to address this need. It aims to build a system that helps policymakers learn from both innovation and strategic insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. Key components of AIG include:
*   **Testing innovations on the ground** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>.
*   **Ensuring citizens have a voice** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[01:02:39]</a>.
*   **Partnering with civil society and businesses** throughout policy cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.
*   **Strengthening trust and democracy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[02:53]</a>. Proactive governance can enhance citizens' trust in government and, conversely, government's trust in its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[03:03]</a>.

This approach is vital given growing pressures from democratic change, economic and social consequences of global pandemics, climate change, and evolving digital environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[03:31]</a>.

## Country Approaches to AIG

### Finland
Finland is at an early stage of building a proper [[strategic_decisionmaking_in_complex_systems | anticipatory innovation system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a> but is optimistic about developing a new model of [[governance_and_technology_interaction | governance]] to stimulate policymaking for future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>.
*   **Building Blocks:** Finland leverages changes in its strategic planning system, particularly the move to a strategic government program system implemented in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. They also draw on experience with experimentation, enabling legislation, digitalization, and "ecosystemic approaches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.
*   **Innovation Models:** Finland has more experience with enhancing, mission-oriented, and adaptive innovation, with the next ambition being anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:12">[01:18:12]</a>.
*   **Challenges:** A key challenge is the lack of an inbuilt connection between intensive foresight work and actual political decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>. Other challenges include:
    *   Widening the understanding of urgency for governance system changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:06">[02:00:06]</a>.
    *   Motivating and involving political decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:28">[02:00:28]</a>.
    *   Identifying and creating new elements in governance, rather than just fine-tuning old processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:06">[02:11:06]</a>.
    *   Changing the role of public administration to be more open and involve citizens and stakeholders in a proactive, co-creative role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31">[02:22:31]</a>.

### Ireland
Ireland is also at the beginning of its journey to systematically introduce strategic foresight into policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:49">[02:48:49]</a>.
*   **Motivation:** The impetus came from reflections during the COVID-19 crisis, following the financial crisis, and in anticipation of the climate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:09">[02:58:09]</a>. The aim is to ensure the public service is "fit for purpose" out to 2030 and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:47">[02:46:47]</a>.
*   **Approach:** They are working with the OECD to explore strategic foresight, identify existing practices, and understand how mega-trends will impact different public service sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>.
*   **Next Steps:** Ireland plans to develop a strategic foresight action plan with capacity building across the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:49">[02:58:49]</a>. This will be integrated into existing governance structures like the Public Service Leadership Board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, ensuring insights are linked into the wider policy-making system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">[03:12:12]</a>. They aim to make strategic foresight a standard part of the policymaking toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.

## Radical Experimentation in Governance
To move beyond traditional foresight, governments need to embrace radical experimentation, creating more evidence to guide future explorations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

### Canada
Canada defines innovation as doing new things, and experimentation as the process of rigorously measuring if those new things work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:44">[04:46:44]</a>.
*   **Initiatives:** Canada has a national push for government experimentation, with teams building capacity and expertise through training programs (e.g., "Experimentation Works") and supporting a community of practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:50">[04:50:50]</a>.
*   **System Change:** They issue directives to senior public servants to encourage experimentation and conduct annual surveys to track if departments are experimenting and using results to inform decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   **Common Barriers:**
    *   **Access to expertise:** Lack of methodological or process knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:45">[04:54:45]</a>.
    *   **Data quality:** Need for better organized and utilized data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:15">[05:01:15]</a>.
    *   **Openness to failure:** Cultural reluctance to risk failing, despite experiments being designed to explore unknowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:39">[05:03:39]</a>. The status quo is also risky, and experimentation can reduce future failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:04">[05:06:04]</a>.
    *   **Timelines:** Experiments are most useful months or years in advance, requiring an anticipatory approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
    *   **Difficulty doing new things:** Government relies heavily on precedent, making it hard to introduce novel approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

### Sweden (Kommit Committee)
The Swedish government's Kommit Committee aims to advance [[governance_and_technology_interaction | technology]] and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>, with an overarching ambition to accelerate progress towards sustainability goals and ensure responsible innovation and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Holistic Perspective:** [[systems_thinking_in_policymaking | AIG]] requires balancing internal agency perspectives, external engagement with citizens and companies, and a holistic view for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   **Three-Part Model for Anticipation:**
    1.  **Understanding:** Continuously understanding rapid technological development (e.g., algorithms in finance) requires employees who comprehend new technologies like AI and blockchain, and work procedures that ensure fair interaction with companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This includes knowledge building through technology briefs and financing for regulatory interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
    2.  **Testing ("Regulatory Greenhouses"):** Sweden aims to be a testing ground for new work ways, technologies, solutions, and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. "Regulatory greenhouses" allow different actors (agencies, companies, civil servants, civil society) to jointly test new ideas under real conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This requires governmental support for developing methodologies, follow-up, incentives, and auditing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.
    3.  **Changing (Agile Regulation):** Legislation can quickly become obsolete due to rapid technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>. Sweden advocates for a step-wise, more agile approach to regulation, starting with understanding, then setting standards or agreements, and finally enacting legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.
*   **Key Drivers:** Collaboration, building capabilities in the public sector, and creating frameworks for all municipalities, regions, and agencies to report regulatory problems hindering innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>. This is seen as a multi-decade cultural journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

### Basque Social Innovation Lab (Gipuzkoa)
This lab focuses on connecting [[strategic_decisionmaking_in_complex_systems | anticipatory governance]] frameworks to specific missions, such as accelerating a region's transition to a more sustainable economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond Traditional Foresight:** The approach combines traditional expert analysis with a portfolio approach that incorporates strong social and cultural initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. This involves deep listening to social and cultural dynamics to build sense-making capabilities at various levels (large-scale public sector, community-driven, small-scale startup) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure for Innovation:** The goal is to generate social, political, public, and private infrastructure that can produce more [[innovative_approaches_to_public_governance | innovative responses]] to emerging problems, rather than solely relying on expert analysis to predict what will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.

### Norway (Seamless Government)
Norway's project on "seamless services and life events" aims to develop user-centric digital services for major life events, improving public sector efficiency and citizen experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>.
*   **Systemic Innovation & Digital Transformation:** This involves both [[systems_thinking_in_policymaking | systemic innovation]] and [[governance_and_technology_interaction | digital transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>, requiring collaboration across municipalities, county authorities, and central government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>.
*   **Anticipation and Missions:** Foresight and anticipatory innovation methodologies are offered to "life event" projects, helping them to explore the future and make scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. This "long view" makes it easier to establish shorter-term missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.
*   **Cross-Silo Work:** Scenario planning provides a common platform for diverse stakeholders to align perspectives and select strategic solutions, addressing strategic blind spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:32">[01:22:32]</a>. Norway fosters an "innovation space" for experimentation and testing new ways of working, cooperating, and steering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:57">[01:24:57]</a>.
*   **Digital Ethics:** To stay ahead of rapid technological change and ensure digital ethics and privacy, governments must include technical startups, private businesses, and voluntary sectors in the development process, fostering joint testing and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a>.

## Broader Reflections on Anticipatory Governance

### Bridging Research and Public Engagement
Efforts are underway to bridge the gap between academic research in [[systems_thinking_in_policymaking | systems analysis]], [[complexity_in_governance | complexity theory]], [[strategic_decisionmaking_in_complex_systems | strategic foresight]], and factual expertise, and to bring the public into this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. In the United States, public understanding is seen as crucial for generating political support for new policy approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>.

The "roundtable process" engages diverse experts and lay people in discussions about disruptive long-range trends (e.g., advanced AI, synthetic biology, climate change, demographics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:46">[01:42:46]</a>. This process teaches methods for "thinking better" and applying them to complex change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:24">[01:45:24]</a>.

### The Challenge of Paradigm Shifts
Traditional foresight often prepares for incremental change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>. However, true [[strategic_decisionmaking_in_complex_systems | paradigm shifts]] are harder to anticipate and budget for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing Complexity:** Recognizing that [[complexity_in_governance | complexity]] means governments cannot control everything, but can influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>. It's about rethinking the entire system to support the desired future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Seeking Radical Imagination:** To anticipate paradigm shifts, it's necessary to identify individuals who think beyond normal confines and give them protected space to express radical ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:19">[02:08:19]</a>. This could involve looking to science fiction for foreshadowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:26">[02:09:26]</a>.
*   **The Inevitable End of Systems:** A provocative view suggests that current systems, including firms, governments, and nation-states, may be "zombies" that must end to allow for new creative emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:20">[02:14:20]</a>. Paradigmatic change is an emergent property of the universe, and the focus should be on acting ethically in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:06">[02:15:06]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion:** A major concern is governments' reluctance to take risks or step out of their comfort zones, often prioritizing "risk assessment" which can stifle [[innovative_approaches_to_public_governance | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:52">[02:16:52]</a>.
*   **Human Cost of Transition:** While accepting the end of systems, it's crucial to consider the hundreds of millions of people affected by these transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The proper function of [[future_governance_and_leadership | governance]] is to manage these changes with care for future generations, not simply rely on history to sort things out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

### Futures Literacy
[[role_of_systems_thinking_in_crisis_management | Futures literacy]] is the discipline of anticipation, which acknowledges that anticipation is fundamental to life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>. Just as people learn to read and write, they can become much better at diverse forms of anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:02">[01:58:02]</a>. It's crucial to have a disciplinary foundation and a theory of the future to underpin these activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:18">[01:58:18]</a>.

### Key Levers for Jumpstarting Anticipatory Innovation
*   **Empowerment:** Give permission to empower people directly dealing with problems, enabling them to envision their own futures and define their own problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:05">[02:21:05]</a>.
*   **Collaboration, Co-creation, Co-design:** Engage multiple disciplines and stakeholders from the very moment an issue is framed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:59">[02:21:59]</a>.
*   **Humility:** Leaders must admit they don't have all the answers and be willing to explore solutions with an open mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:13">[02:22:13]</a>.

The OECD is actively engaged in developing AIG, collaborating with countries like Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Sweden, and the Basque Country to build practical systems and explore new missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:56">[02:28:56]</a>. The aim is to prevent governments from becoming "locked in" to old ways and to guide them through necessary transitions with an ethical and thoughtful approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:18">[02:29:18]</a>.

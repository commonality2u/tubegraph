Cultural understanding plays a pivotal role in fostering successful innovation, particularly in cross-border contexts. Effective collaboration hinges on acknowledging and navigating cultural nuances, building trust, and fostering strong relationships among diverse actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

## Cultural Differences and Trust

One of the significant issues in cross-border cooperation is understanding the culture and language of the other party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. National stereotypes, even within a single country or between states, can influence interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>. The building of trust is essential, often stemming not from inherent mistrust, but simply from a lack of familiarity among counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. Investing in these relationships and knowing one's counterparts is highly valuable, as it makes communication and problem-solving much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Relationships and effective communication are fundamental to achieving common goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>, with trust serving as a key element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

## Building Relationships and Shared Vision

Developing a common goal is necessary to achieve results in collaborative efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>. This necessitates starting with a concrete or limited problem or area for cooperation, as it's easier to manage than a broad understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. Cross-border partnerships are driven by strong relationships and a common mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. The personal touch and human interaction are paramount, as there are no algorithms to replace the social contract between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>. This human contact is especially crucial in times when cross-border engagement may not be as popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. A personal commitment to always listening is the first step towards learning and opening doors for collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>.

## Impact of Proximity and Identity

Geographic proximity often correlates with cultural proximity, which in turn fosters trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. For example, the mentality in northern Sweden and northern Finland is quite similar, sometimes more so than between different regions within Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. However, effective cross-border innovation requires building trust with countries further away, which is currently a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

[[definition_and_challenges_of_innovation | Innovation]] and cross-border work also relate to identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>. An individual born and living locally, far from the international sphere, is not naturally inclined to cooperate; it's a skill that must be learned and nurtured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

## Challenges to Understanding and Collaboration

Challenges to effective cross-border collaboration include:
*   **Cultural and Language Barriers:** Difficulty in understanding the culture and language of counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.
*   **Organizational Tribalism:** A tendency for public or private sector entities to prioritize their own work, often leading to a lack of "permission" or incentives for cross-border or cross-sectoral work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Polarization:** Instruments of globalization, such as social media, paradoxically drive people apart by polarizing societies and limiting exposure to diverse information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.
*   **Distance from Problem:** Decision-makers far from the border or the problem may find it hard to recognize or know where to start in solving issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.
*   **Lack of Incentives:** There is a need for both "carrots" (incentives) and "sticks" (mandatory requirements) to encourage public servants to engage in cross-border collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. Without ingrained requirements, it remains a political preference rather than a systematic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Barriers

To overcome these challenges and foster [[systems_thinking_in_innovation | systemic collaboration]]:
*   **Invest in Relationships:** Encourage agency leaders to invest in relationships, recognizing the value of knowing their counterparts for ongoing benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.
*   **Learn from the Border:** The people living and dealing with borders often have the best knowledge and solutions to cross-border problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. Engaging them directly in problem-solving environments can provide valuable insights and practical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.
*   **Utilize External Funding and Partnerships:** Seeking funding from international organizations (like the European Investment Bank) can sometimes garner national interest and support for local cross-border projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.
*   **Broaden Stakeholder Engagement:** [[engaging_stakeholders_in_innovation | Engaging stakeholders]] beyond traditional governmental actors, including companies, NGOs, and the broader civil society, is crucial for comprehensive information and understanding the real-world impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>.
*   **Embrace Uncertainty:** In uncertain situations, the best approach is to avoid turning inward and instead pursue cross-border collaboration to learn from others, share risks, and pool resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. This proactive approach can lead to better solutions, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>.
*   **Develop Skills:** Public servants need training to acquire skills in international and cross-border cooperation, as it's not an innate ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.
*   **Formalize Arrangements:** More formalized arrangements can help break down barriers, especially concerning funding metrics that may disincentivize co-investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.

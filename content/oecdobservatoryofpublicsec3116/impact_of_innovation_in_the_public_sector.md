Innovation is generally defined as the introduction of new things, novelty, or concepts that did not previously exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While the private sector has a clearer understanding of innovation due to market feedback, defining and assessing [[public_sector_innovation | innovation in the public sector]] is more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Defining [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]]

In the private sector, innovation involves implementing something new in a market context to gain a competitive advantage, whether it's a service, process, product, or new thinking leading to a direct market proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

However, the public sector lacks the market's feedback system, making its definition unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. [[public_sector_innovation | Public sector innovation]] is about novelty, specifically things new to a particular context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It's not just about inventions or ideas, but about *implemented* and *applied* new thinking, services, or processes that have an actual impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Contribution to Public Value

Unlike the private sector where competitive advantage drives innovation, governments are typically the sole service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Therefore, [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] focuses on contributing to a "change in public value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Potential Impacts

The impact of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation in the public sector]] can be both positive and negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Positive Impacts
*   **Improved Service Delivery:** Innovations, such as digital advancements, can enable quicker delivery of services to various populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Negative Impacts
*   **Exclusion:** While aiming to improve services, innovations can inadvertently exclude certain segments of the population. For example, digital services might sideline individuals without access to digital tools or the capability to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Ultimately, innovation in the public sector involves new things implemented in a new context, intended to bring some form of value to the population it serves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

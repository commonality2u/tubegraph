Co-creation involves engaging various stakeholders to identify problems, and design and implement solutions for robust outcomes and greater support for decisions made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This approach aims to build inclusive societies and better futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The core definition of co-creation involves stakeholders in identifying all dimensions of a problem or issue, and designing and implementing solutions through a generative exchange of insights and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Differentiating Co-creation from Consultation

Co-creation is distinctly different from simply informing or consultative practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. While consultation might involve online surveys asking for comments on a draft policy, often resulting in controversial, disconnected ideas (monologues), co-creation emphasizes a generative exchange where people "get together" to discuss, refine ideas, and align on a path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Co-creation encompasses co-designing policies, co-constructing services, and co-experiencing, then improving what has been co-created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Key Principles and Success Factors

Several preconditions and attributes contribute to the success of [[importance_of_cocreation_in_public_policy | co-creation processes]]:

*   **Political Backing and Clear Purpose** Political backing and momentum are essential, alongside a clear purpose defining the problem to be solved, allowing participants to help arrive at the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Teams and Resources** A highly capable secretariat is needed to manage content, while a high-powered hosting team manages the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Budget for informal interactions like lunches and coffees (for in-person meetings) is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Time Investment** Although perceived as time-consuming initially, co-creation leads to more effective implementation and public acceptance due to buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Authenticity and Trust** It is crucial to be authentic, meaning what is said and following through on commitments. The process should not be a facade for pre-determined solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Trust and listening are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning** [[collaboration_and_innovation_in_public_sector | Learning experiences]] are crucial, both for participants and the administration. Officials can learn more in a day of participatory work than in a year of detailed study with external consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Integration Across Policy Cycle** Participation is beneficial across all phases of the policy cycle—problem definition, solution design, implementation, and evaluation—with particular importance in the definition of the problem and solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Mindset and Openness** A different mindset is required, involving openness to new ideas, views, and opinions. Without knowledge and openness, progress is hindered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Addressing Complexity** For increasing uncertainty and complex challenges, [[collaborative_approaches_in_public_sector_innovation | co-creation]] is vital for sharing diverse views, findings, knowledge, and experience to create better and more sustainable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Simple problems with known solutions do not require extensive participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Project Ownership and Mandate** A committed project owner or sponsor with the mandate to design, deliver, and implement solutions in a co-creative manner is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Clear Commitments and Communication** After the process, concrete commitments with clear taskholders and deadlines for implementation are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Regular, two-way communication about progress builds understanding and trust among stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

## Practical Approaches and Tools

### 1. Facilitation and Dialogue
Facilitators play a key role in making it easier for people across divides to talk and solve issues together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Classic techniques like World Cafe, Open Space Technology, and Circle Practice can be used, often tailored to specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Meetings should be meticulously designed and scripted, yet allow participants complete freedom in discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### 2. Building Innovation Communities
Establishing innovation community platforms allows for networking, learning, support, and the transfer of good practices and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Regular events, workshops, hackathons, and design sprints can be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Innovation ambassadors, active in both the community and their work environment, can serve as entry points in their institutions and promote co-creative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

### 3. Digital Toolkits
Holistic digital toolkits can support public organizations in implementing co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. An example is the Cogo Digital Toolkit, which includes four tools:

*   **CoReady:** Assesses an organization's readiness for co-creation through a self-evaluation questionnaire. It provides a roadmap for improvement and allows comparison with other organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   **CoServe:** Helps determine which public service is most suitable for renewal based on co-creation, using a questionnaire to assess service features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **CoNew:** Actively includes service users in the renewal process using user journey mapping to identify problems and suggest improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
*   **CoMaster:** Assesses the quality of co-creation during public service renewal, identifying areas for future improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

### 4. Working with Complexity
In complex systems, co-creation is a continuous act, not a one-off event, because problem domains are continuously evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. No central authority can fully understand or control a complex system; co-creation becomes the only way to deal with this informational problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

### 5. Openness and Transparency
Openly publishing results and maintaining meticulous records helps protect against undue influence from lobbyists, as it ensures transparency and mutual policing of the "lobby space" by all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>. The process itself must be transparent, with open documentation of the process, learnings, and reflections made publicly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.

### 6. Recruiting for Different Skills
Instead of just training, public sector organizations need to consider recruiting individuals with skills suited to "holding space," which requires high levels of emotional intelligence and social presence, fundamentally different from control-oriented project management skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

## Challenges in Implementation

*   **Hierarchical Mindsets:** A significant barrier is the ingrained hierarchical mindset within government authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.
*   **Lack of Participatory Knowledge and Skills:** Insufficient knowledge, skills, and tools for participatory processes are commonly cited obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Change:** Leaders often prioritize quick results without providing the necessary support in terms of knowledge and competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
*   **Rigid Regulatory Frameworks:** Public organizations can be limited by inflexible regulative frameworks, procurement procedures, and national legislation that impede experimentation and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.
*   **Siloed Structures:** A lack or absence of silos within organizations is important for effective co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.
*   **Budgeting and Agility:** Long-term budget planning (e.g., two years in advance for the European Commission) makes it difficult to implement agile, flexible, and iterative policy processes that need to adapt weekly based on learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.

## The Role of Public Officials

Public officials in co-creation processes should not merely interpret or mediate between participants and outcomes, as this risks losing trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. Instead, their role can include:

*   **Holding Space:** Providing the environment for discussion without controlling the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.
*   **Provoking for Public Interest:** Challenging consensus that might form solely around community interests, by introducing and driving the public interest perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Legitimacy:** When deviating from traditional policymaking, ensuring ethical rigor and transparency in the process is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
*   **Building Learning Capacity:** Co-creation should foster a learning community, enabling distributed learning among all partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>.
*   **Addressing Future Generations:** Considering how to include future generations as stakeholders, especially given the long-term impacts of current decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

## Case Studies and Examples

### The European Commission's Circular Plastics Alliance
This alliance aimed to keep waste plastic out of landfills, with a target of recycling 10 million tons of used plastic into new products annually by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. It involved a complex system of stakeholders from chemical producers to recyclers, public authorities, and regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Instead of legislating, the Commission created an alliance, inviting members of the value chain to join and build a declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This involved fully participatory working group meetings, utilizing classic participatory techniques and building trust through generative exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Slovenia's `innovative.si` Project
The `innovative.si` project in Slovenia focuses on creatively resolving complex social challenges and building competences for a different way of working, aiming to strengthen innovation culture in public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. It involves matching public sector challenges with facilitators to navigate co-creative processes, often with public sector employees as part of the facilitation team to foster learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The project emphasizes active user involvement from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a> and has built a community of over 400 members from public, private, and academic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

### Dark Matter Labs' Work on Mental Health
When dealing with multi-actor problems like mental health in cities, where no single agency can drive change, building a community (e.g., "MindShift" in Sweden) is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. This approach highlights the importance of politicians being present to "hold space" and embark on a learning journey alongside others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

## Crisis as Opportunity

Crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic, highlight that current policymaking processes are often not agile enough to deal with "long emergencies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>. The need for governments to implement policies, observe data, and iteratively change (parametrically) demonstrates a different policy mechanism where large-scale experiments are continuously iterated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. This requires fundamentally different ways of communicating and participating with the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.

In co-creation, stakeholders are citizens, blurring traditional divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. The increased use of citizen juries and citizen assemblies as key deliberative frameworks is expected to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:08">[00:56:08]</a>. The concept of "care" becomes fundamental in designing institutions that are open to uncertainty and recognize the critical role of others in delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[public_sector_innovation_and_collaboration | Implementing co-creation in the public sector]] involves more than just tools; it requires a fundamental shift in mindset, a willingness to embrace complexity, and a commitment to continuous learning and transparency. By engaging diverse stakeholders, fostering trust, and adapting administrative frameworks, governments can achieve more robust, legitimate, and sustainable solutions for shared challenges.

The recent crisis significantly accelerated the [[Innovation and digital transformation in public services | digital transformation in health care]], leading to rapid changes that were previously thought impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This shift has been evident across various aspects of healthcare systems, from technology adoption to the redesign of care processes.

## Acceleration of Existing Trends

The pandemic primarily accelerated existing trends within healthcare rather than entirely rethinking its direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>. Key areas of acceleration include:

*   **Digitalization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>
*   **Patient-centeredness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>
*   **Collaboration within health systems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:44">[00:55:44]</a>
*   **Focus on [[Public sector digital transformation | public health]] measures** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>

### Examples of Digital Adoption

Countries rapidly deployed and expanded [[Digital transformation and egovernment | digital health]] tools and platforms:

*   **Ireland**
    *   Rolled out telehealth in General Practitioner (GP) practices and Outpatient Department (OPD) clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.
    *   Fast-tracked the implementation of electronic transfer of prescriptions, a change previously resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.
    *   Introduced a COVID-19 tracker tracing app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   **Sweden**
    *   Made a "frog leap" in establishing a digitalized health system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
    *   Delivered health services digitally for follow-up visits (especially for chronic conditions), digital monitoring for patients in their homes, renewing pharmaceutical prescriptions, and various consultations and health information services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
    *   Utilized national digital platforms for information and contacting health services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The investment in [[Innovation and digital transformation in public services | digitization of health service delivery]] is expected to be permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.
*   **Israel**
    *   The pandemic acted as the "best accelerator of [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]]" for the country's [[digital_transformation_in_governance | digital health]] initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.
    *   Long-standing resistance and bureaucratic hurdles to [[digital_transformation_and_egovernment | digital health]] were overcome in days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:21">[01:03:21]</a>.
    *   Rapid transition to online care, focusing on proactive chronic disease management and preventive medicine using existing [[Digital Transformation and Data Governance | data infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
    *   Future care will increasingly be provided online, with new types of synchronous and asynchronous healthcare provision gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>.
    *   [[Digital transformation and egovernment | Digital transformation]] is understood as a redesign of care processes augmented by [[Digital Transformation and Data Governance | digital capabilities]] and technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>.
*   **Korea**
    *   Made effective use of its existing [[Digital Transformation and Data Governance | data infrastructure]] to manage the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   Leveraged a national health insurance system covering 100% of the population with a single unified payer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
    *   Developed a national drug utilization system that allows doctors and pharmacists to track drug safety and administration in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
    *   The system enabled clinicians to check patients' COVID-19 risk history, including travel from high-prevalence areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
    *   Developed a mask distribution system to manage panic buying, allowing tracking of purchasing history and sharing information with pharmacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
    *   The national health insurance and advanced information infrastructure were crucial, even though not initially developed for COVID-19 management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.

## New Learnings and Future Directions

The crisis also prompted new insights and potential shifts in strategy:

*   **Preparedness and Adaptive Capacity:**
    *   Sweden realized its society was too dependent on timely delivery with insufficient storages, leading to shortages of PPE and other medical equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.
    *   The need for better preparedness and systems that can adapt quickly to new situations and crises was highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.
    *   A key learning is to train the ability to adapt to crises, rather than just preparing for specific past events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.
*   **Cross-Sectoral Collaboration:**
    *   The need for better collaboration between the [[public_sector_digital_transformation | public sector]], civil society, and industry was recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>. Pathways for working with industry (e.g., pharmaceuticals) should be built in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>.
    *   The "goodwill" and "community support" from the public, including volunteers, played a significant role, particularly in Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.
*   **Redesigning the Health System (Korea):**
    *   The crisis emphasized the need to redesign the health system in Korea towards a more [[public_sector_digital_transformation | public sector]]-dominant model, focusing on safety and human security at a national level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>.
    *   It was realized that health issues are deeply linked with other sectors of human security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.
    *   The importance of healthcare resources and delivery for infectious diseases, not just epidemiological testing or public health, became clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>.
    *   Universal healthcare coverage is seen as critically important for building resilient and prepared healthcare systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>.
*   **Investment in Prevention:**
    *   Sweden identified an increased need to invest in preventive measures and [[public_sector_digital_transformation | public health]] to manage increasing waiting times, beyond just performing more surgical interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10">[01:39:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
    *   Ireland increased its well-being budget from 6 million to 20 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>, and is looking at alternative wellness within its public health system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities

The pandemic presented both challenges and opportunities for health systems. While the health system was "used as a political football" in Ireland previously, there is now a "genuine appreciation" and a "window of opportunity" for improved collaboration and empowerment of health services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. In Latvia, the crisis offered an opportunity to end the "false dilemma" of health versus economy or political issues, which has hindered progress for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. There is hope that governments will realize the impact of under-investing in healthcare systems on the entire economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. The understanding that pandemics are recurring events necessitates maintaining safety margins within healthcare systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>.

The relationship between people and government has become increasingly frayed over the past decade, with a series of global shocks shaking [[citizen_trust_and_public_communication | citizens' trust]] in their government's ability to adapt and meet changing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Historically, debates around public service reform have focused on "what" government should do, "how" services should be structured, or "how" decisions should be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. However, the [[trust_and_power_in_citizengovernment_relationships | damaged relationship between government and citizens]] highlights that insufficient emphasis has been placed on "how" government should operate, including the beliefs and principles driving government action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## The Importance of Trust

Trust is crucial for the success of public measures, particularly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. As stated by Secretary of State Maria Fonseca of Portugal, "Trust is what makes the difference between the success and the unsuccess of our measures in this time of pandemic crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. This means that government decisions and policies are more likely to be effective when citizens have confidence in their government.

## Key Components for Building Trust

### Communication and Vulnerability
[[role_of_communication_and_transparency_in_building_trust | Trust begins with communication and participation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. Governments have adapted their communication strategies during the pandemic, making them more human-centered and deliberately targeting communities not normally reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. Examples include innovative communication techniques like using Easter bunny costumes for child-focused messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>, and engaging with migrant communities in Norway to ensure messages are understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.

A powerful argument has been made that government leaders can also be vulnerable, and this vulnerability is an important aspect of [[building_trust_in_public_institutions | building a trusting relationship between government and citizens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This openness and transparency about uncertainty and decision-making during the crisis has led to increases in [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.

### Participatory Processes and Inclusivity
Ensuring everybody is involved in the decision-making process helps [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | build trust]] and brings people on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. Transparency and openness in these processes improve people's attitudes and compliance with measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.

### A Focus on Well-being and Human-Centered Approaches
Governments need to rethink their mission, focusing on well-being and creating an environment where people can feel safe and [[the_role_of_trust_between_government_and_society | trust in governments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. This involves new definitions and measures of well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Human-centric regulations must accompany digitization, ensuring data privacy, transparency, and digital rights are central to every strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. Technology should serve as a tool, not replace human elements, with people remaining at the center of policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

While [[building_trust_in_government_response | trust]] has increased in many contexts during the crisis, it is built over time and needs to be sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. This requires continuous reflection in government structures, processes, and participatory methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.

Key challenges to address include:
*   **Short-term thinking:** Governments must overcome the tendency for short-term solutions driven by political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. The Black Lives Matter movement and the pandemic have created space for more long-term, systems-thinking discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Rigid ways of working:** Failures of public sector agencies are often attributed to rigid ways of working, the assumption that government has all the answers, and processes not conducive to systems thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. A process of "unlearning" old assumptions and mental models is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Siloed structures:** Collaborative interactions and relationship building across sectors and silos, both within and across governments, were powerful during the crisis and need to be continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis, much like the 2008 global financial crisis, serves as a "pivot point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. The challenge is to ensure that governments truly heed the lessons learned and embed them into their operations, resisting the "gravitational pull" back to previous default settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. This requires connecting, empowering, and legitimizing efforts both within and outside government to demand better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.

This article explores how the [[public_sector_challenges_and_transformations | public sector]] can sustain dramatic [[public_administration_transformation | transformations]] observed during crises, moving beyond the immediate emergency [00:00:10]. The discussion focuses on whether the pandemic will lead to "business as usual" or induce sustainable, resourced, and long-standing [[public_sector_innovation | innovations]] in governance that will endure [00:00:35].

## Poll Results on Post-Pandemic Change

A poll conducted during the session initially showed overwhelming optimism for enduring change, with 85.7% (12 out of 14 responses) believing in sustainable innovation [00:05:50]. However, with more responses, the sentiment shifted, with approximately one-third of participants indicating a return to "business as usual" and two-thirds expecting sustainable, long-standing [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] [00:10:41].

## Government Aftershock Initiative

This discussion is part of the "Government Aftershock" initiative, an OECD experiment in collective learning aimed at understanding the implications of the pandemic on the institution of government [00:01:28]. Over 60 related events have been run globally, uniting efforts around three central questions:
*   What should be left behind after the pandemic in terms of governance and state management? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   What should be kept? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   What should be done differently given the lessons learned? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

This session specifically addresses how to sustain the positive waves of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and [[public_administration_transformation | transformation]] unlocked by the crisis, with a goal to look forward and maintain momentum [00:02:22]. The OECD's Innovative Responses Tracker has captured over 430 innovative responses across various policy areas, functions, and services [00:02:38].

## Crisis as a Catalyst for Change

The pandemic accelerated many changes that were already in progress or had long been called for [00:03:00]. Examples include:
*   **Widespread remote working and telehealth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   **Desiloing the state** and encouraging more collaboration across policy areas [00:03:20]
*   **Greater engagement of stakeholders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
*   **Raising the risk tolerance** of public sector institutions to enable [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] [00:03:29]
*   **Reducing administrative burden** and creating space for entrepreneurial public servants [00:03:37]

Historically, several barriers prevented these changes from happening sooner:
*   **Bandwidth constraints** in large, hierarchical organizations, making it difficult to focus on consistent programs of reform amidst daily demands [00:19:17].
*   **Vested interests** that resist changes which affect economic interests or work practices, where benefits are dispersed but costs are concentrated [00:19:57].
*   **Risk aversion** within the [[public_sector_challenges_and_transformations | public service]], often due to intense scrutiny and a "gotcha" culture that punishes mistakes [00:20:36].
*   **Habit** rather than law, preventing the adoption of new practices like working from home [00:24:35].
*   **Lack of entrepreneurial mindset** until a crisis forces a "burning platform" for change [00:24:18].
*   **Slow policy-making and communication**, which were replaced by fast decision-making and dynamic teams during the crisis [00:25:20].
*   **Limited funding for contingency planning** and sustaining long-term interest in preparedness [00:28:37].
*   **Barriers to scaling pilot programs**, which the pandemic helped overcome by releasing funding and breaking down scale barriers [00:29:22].

The crisis provided a strong kick from government and political leadership, opening the "dam" for changes [00:22:32]. It created a sense of purpose and autonomy among public servants, fostering a team sport mentality [00:24:50].

## Enduring Transformations

Several changes observed during the crisis are likely to persist:
*   **Work from Anywhere**: The "working place is not anymore a building" [00:31:17]. A blended approach to work, with some days at home and some in the office, is expected to become normal [00:37:08]. This will drive changes in how classified information is handled, performance is evaluated, and the essential nature of reliable childcare is recognized [00:39:52].
*   **[[public_sector_digital_transformation | Digitalization]] and Data-Driven Decision-Making**: Expect continued emphasis on digital services, eliminating paper forms, and making decisions based on data [00:33:26]. This includes the application of artificial intelligence and machine augmentation, such as chatbots, to reduce service time and allow humans to focus on higher-value work [00:40:43].
*   **Increased Speed, Agility, and Incremental [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]]**: The ability to react quickly, experiment, and innovate incrementally is expected to remain [00:34:20].
*   **Enhanced Collaboration and Consultation**: Collaboration within government, with society, and between nations is a key takeaway [00:35:28]. There's a move towards deformalizing processes and designing bottom-up solutions by involving all stakeholders [00:35:07].
*   **Higher Health System Capacity**: Increased capacity, robust test and tracing systems, and infrastructure for future crises will likely remain [00:38:11]. Immunization programs will require sophisticated data systems due to varied vaccine types [00:38:35].
*   **Focus on Foresight**: Increased investment in foresight and scenario planning is needed to better prepare for the future [00:39:09].
*   **Appreciation of Social and Racial Justice**: A systematic recognition of the impact of social and racial justice in government programs, particularly at state and local levels, is driving adjustments for more equitable outcomes [00:41:44].

## Challenges to Sustaining Change

Despite positive changes, several challenges remain for sustaining [[public_sector_resilience_and_transformation | public sector resilience and transformation]]:
*   **Societal Capacity Gaps**: Governments cannot go faster than society can follow. Issues like digital literacy and accessibility, and access to broadband, were highlighted during online education transitions [00:44:46].
*   **Equitable Distribution of Aid**: Complex federalist systems can hinder efficient and equitable distribution of aid funds, leading to different levels of perceived support and impacting public trust [00:47:03].
*   **Impact on Public Education and Social Structures**: The upending of public education affects access to broadband, social support networks, and food security for vulnerable communities, highlighting broader societal vulnerabilities [00:47:46].
*   **Politicization of Response**: The politicization of crisis response can challenge public compliance with protocols and willingness to access government assistance [00:48:40].
*   **Public Trust**: Trust in government is crucial. While the public sector's standing might improve post-pandemic compared to the 2008 financial crisis (where governments were blamed for failing to regulate banks), public perception of governmental effectiveness will ultimately impact sustained change [00:49:07].
*   **Human Capital and Skills**: The ability to attract and nurture the right people with the necessary skills and motivation into the public service is vital [00:49:53].
*   **Data Utilization**: Optimizing how data is used, linked, and leveraged for better decision-making and service provision is a significant internal capacity issue [00:50:43].
*   **Continuous Learning**: Governments must embrace continuous learning for all personnel, not just new recruits [00:52:01].

## Funding and Fiscal Realities

The "million-dollar question" is how to make the budget case for investments in [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and [[public_sector_resilience_and_transformation | resilience]] once the urgency recedes, especially given the austerity measures often chosen after crises like the global financial crisis [00:53:08].
*   **Debt Levels**: Many countries face significant national debt (e.g., US national debt near 100% of GDP) and decreased budget flexibility due to policies like tax reductions and increasing entitlement programs [00:53:53].
*   **Local Government Strain**: Local governments are spending rainy day funds, facing declining property tax bases, and incurring increased public health costs, leading to potential massive reductions and reorganizations in government structure and entitlement programs [00:54:35].
*   **Self-Financing Changes**: Some structural changes, like [[public_sector_digital_transformation | digitalization]], could be self-financing over time due to efficiency gains, potentially providing a short payback period [00:56:38].
*   **Demographic Challenges**: Severe demographic problems (slowing economies, increased age-related entitlement and health costs) will add future fiscal constraints, leading to a period of intense debate around fiscal priorities [00:57:23].
*   **Different Crisis Response**: Unlike the 2008 financial crisis where citizens blamed governments for banking failures and austerity, the pandemic is not government-caused, and governmental responses might be viewed more favorably, potentially leading to a different public discourse on fiscal policy [00:58:06].
*   **Strategic Investments**: Countries that invested strategically in areas like technology (e.g., Serbia's growing tech sector) have shown greater [[public_sector_resilience_and_transformation | resilience]] and mitigated economic impact [01:01:00].

## Decommissioning Old Habits

To move forward, certain administrative habits need to be decommissioned:
*   **Not ending things**: Public sectors must learn to cease projects or programs that are no longer effective, rather than perpetually starting new ones [01:04:22].
*   **Risk Aversion**: A culture shift towards taking balanced, sensible risks is needed, which also requires a change in media and political discourse to move away from a "gotcha" culture [01:05:36].
*   **Long Cycles of Policy Making and Adoption**: Governments should adopt faster, more agile, and incremental policy-making processes, fundamentally changing legislation and policy creation [01:07:06].
*   **Siloed Working**: The habit of working in isolated silos must be eliminated [01:04:58].
*   **Lifetime Career Model**: Building a service model that allows for movement between government and private sectors could introduce more [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] and risk tolerance by fostering a more permeable barrier for knowledge exchange [01:07:33].

## Personal Commitments to Future Transformation

Panelists shared their personal commitments for future action in light of the crisis:
*   **Terry Gerton (US National Academy of Public Administration)**: To work with public administrators at all levels to address social and racial equity issues within policy programs, focusing on basic assistance programs, their structure, practices, and outcomes [01:09:44].
*   **Juhan Damski (Finnish Ministry of the Environment)**: To personally lower his carbon footprint and increase his "carbon handprint," aligning with environmental goals [01:10:22].
*   **Robert Watt (Irish Department of Public Expenditure and Reform)**: To personally focus more on nurturing the next generation of leaders within public service organizations, investing in the future of these crucial societal institutions [01:11:08].
*   **Marta Arsovska Tomovska (Serbian Prime Minister's Office)**: To work more with the Serbian National Academy for Public Administration on instilling an [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] culture and influencing the mindset of government employees to be more flexible and cope with the future [01:11:46].

The session concluded by emphasizing the importance of continued global collaboration and discussion to learn from the crisis and prepare for future challenges [01:13:00].

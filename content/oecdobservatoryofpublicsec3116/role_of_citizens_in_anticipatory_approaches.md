The public sector is considered the cornerstone in difficult situations, with citizens relying on it during times of crisis and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This reliance underscores the need for public administration to be prepared and plan accordingly to meet evolving challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Efforts to enhance [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] are aimed at building more resilient public sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, ensuring that quality services and policies are delivered for both citizens and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## Integrating Citizens into the Anticipatory Process

A key aspect of [[anticipatory_innovation_and_governance | anticipatory innovation and governance]] is enabling human-centricity in public service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This involves:

*   **Envisioning Future Opportunities** Public administrations need to engage with people to understand what types of futures or opportunities they would like to pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. This contributes to making [[anticipatory_innovation_and_governance | anticipatory innovation]] more democratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   **Building Trust** [[anticipatory_innovation_and_futures_thinking | Anticipatory approaches]] build trust between citizens, public officials, and politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. When governments proactively work to make the future better, rather than merely reacting to crises, it fosters confidence and resilience within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>. The ability of government to innovate is directly linked to the public's trust in government generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>.
*   **Citizen Participation** Finland has explicitly integrated citizen participation into its [[anticipatory_innovation_governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. While tools like the Finnish National Dialogue models are just one component, they signify a serious commitment to involving citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. The objective is to involve citizens throughout the policy cycle, enabling them to discuss not only current issues but also future, anticipatory ones, thereby gathering valuable knowledge from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

Despite advancements, public administrations globally still face challenges in fully integrating citizens into anticipatory processes. A recent poll indicated that over 60% of participants felt their governments were only "somewhat" confident or "not at all confident" in their ability to anticipate future risks and innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>. This suggests significant work remains to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:20">[01:29:20]</a>.

The goal is to develop solutions that meet users' needs several years into the future, ensuring public services remain relevant and attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. This requires fostering a culture within public administrations that promotes and integrates foresight and innovation into daily practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>. Initiatives like Portugal's "2050 Lab" are attempting to create a highly participatory visioning project, gathering diverse visions from civil society and citizens on what Portugal could and should be in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.

Ultimately, [[anticipatory_innovation_and_public_sector | anticipatory innovation in the public sector]] is not merely a "nice-to-have" but a critical element for governments to effectively integrate their work and deliver in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a>. Finland's pioneering work in developing a model that integrates future thinking, foresight, and innovation as a core operating system offers a blueprint for other countries to learn from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.

Two recent OECD reports, conducted in partnership with the Brazilian National School for Public Administration (ENAP), provide an overview of public sector innovation in Brazil, with one specifically focusing on skills and leadership for innovation in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Context of the Reports
The collaboration between ENAP and the OECD began in 2015 with a Memorandum of Understanding focused on public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Following a successful digital government review in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, two new reports were initiated: one on innovation skills and leadership, and another on the public sector innovation ecosystem in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. A key challenge identified by ENAP was updating [[resources_for_skills_and_capacity_building_in_public_service | capacity building]] for the [[skills_for_the_future_in_the_public_sector | skills of the 21st century]] for civil servants and senior executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

The reports' development spanned different administrations in Brazil (started in one, concluded in another after 2018 elections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. An external vision from the OECD was crucial for maintaining continuity and solidity for both topics during this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Importance of Skills and Leadership for Innovation
Effective leadership is critical to support innovation in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. A lack of leadership support is often a major barrier to successful public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. The report aimed to identify the types of skills and competencies needed among senior civil servants to foster public sector innovation and become stewards of an innovation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

### Why Focus on Senior Civil Servants?
Senior civil servants are the most pivotal group with the control and power to enable or drive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.
*   **Productivity and Efficiency:** Brazil's civil service is costly, with remuneration expenses at almost 30% of public expenditure compared to an OECD average of 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. Effective leadership manages this investment in people, ensuring they are supported and directed to use their talent to meet pressing needs like innovation, thereby preventing productivity loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.
*   **Building Trust:** There are significant [[building_trust_through_effective_public_administration | challenges in public trust in government]] in Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>. Research links the effectiveness of senior civil servants to greater integrity in the public service, which in turn leads to greater trust from citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. A highly qualified, professional senior civil service is a strong indicator of less corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.
*   **Supporting Innovation:** [[empowering public servants | Leadership support]] is one of the most crucial elements for successful innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.

### Key Skills for Public Sector Innovation
Public leadership for innovation is highly contextualized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. Leaders need to understand their situation and apply the right tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. The report identifies six core skill areas for public sector innovation, which should be supported within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. A leader's job is to ensure their workforce possesses and can activate these [[skills_for_the_future_in_the_public_sector | skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

A survey was conducted with almost 3,000 Brazilian civil servants to assess these skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>:
*   **Individual Self-Assessment:** Civil servants rated their own skills at a middle level, with strong curiosity but less confidence in areas like iteration or user-centricity (understanding users of services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.
*   **Managerial Support:** Perception of managers' ability to support skill utilization was significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.
*   **Organizational Readiness:** Perception of organizational readiness to implement these skills fell between individual and managerial assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.

Specific gaps identified included low confidence in prototyping and the use of behavioral insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.

### Leadership Mindsets for Innovation
Workshops with Brazilian public sector innovators identified three main skill groups for leaders, founded on public service values and ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>:
1.  **Business Skills:** Ability to align resources with needs and use management tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.
2.  **Innovation Skills:** Leaders don't need to be experts in data science or iterative processes, but they must understand how these processes are supported and led, and create space for those using these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
3.  **Mindsets:** This category was a key discussion point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a> and includes qualities like:
    *   Empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>
    *   Ability to [[empowering public servants | empower civil servants]], innovators, and even citizens to co-create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>
    *   Understanding of [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | continuous learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>
    *   Courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>
    *   Digital mindset (organizing services and concepts digitally) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>

## Building a Senior Civil Service System for Innovation
Most OECD countries have a structured senior civil service system that defines desired leadership, develops leaders, selects them based on criteria, and reinforces behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. The report uses a supply and demand model to analyze this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>.

### Supply Side: Building Leaders
*   **Defining Skills:** Clearly define the skills required for innovative leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>.
*   **Development Opportunities:** Provide opportunities to develop these skills, both for current leaders and, more importantly, for the future leadership pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **Workforce Mapping:** Map existing skills within the workforce to identify available talent for leadership [[challenges_faced_by_public_servants | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.
*   **Learning Culture:** Foster a [[Public Sector Resilience and Transformation | learning culture]] for innovation to ensure continuous learning and skill revision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.

### Demand Side: Calling for Leaders
*   **Appointment Processes:** Ensure transparent, merit-based appointment processes for senior positions that use innovation-related criteria for selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.
*   **Support and Accountability:** Once leaders are in place, provide support through training, performance management, and accountability mechanisms to ensure they remain innovative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.

### Key Findings and Recommendations
Brazil has put considerable effort into building the supply of leadership through various innovation training initiatives, many led by ENAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. However, very little has been done on the demand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. This is partly due to Brazil's political system, where appointments are often made at the will of the president and ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>, making building demand a significant political challenge requiring political buy-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

Recommendations are categorized into immediate, second-stage, and longer-term steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.

#### Building the Supply:
*   **Immediate:** ENAP and others should develop a hub to unify diverse innovation initiatives across ministries and sub-national levels, including civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **Second Stage:** Use this network to develop a unified innovative leadership competency model based on collaborative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.
*   **Training Alignment:** Create greater transparency in training offers and conduct skills analysis to align training with the competency model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.

#### Building the Demand:
*   **Immediate:** Develop more merit-based hiring practices that assess innovation competencies for senior roles. A presidential decree has already set minimum criteria for some positions, which is a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
*   **Second Stage:** ENAP could pilot programs to support new hiring and recruitment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.
*   **Longer-term:** Scale up and embed these practices into legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>. This must be done carefully to avoid collapse and reinforce negative narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.
*   **Job Profiles & Performance Assessments:** Incorporate innovation-oriented objectives into job profiles and performance assessments for senior civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. This is difficult to measure mechanically, but it is vital to provide clear job descriptions and objectives for innovation, offering personal cover and incentives to civil servants who face [[challenges_faced_by_public_servants | personal risk]] when attempting novel approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.

## Role of Universities
Universities play a crucial role in [[resources_for_skills_and_capacity_building_in_public_service | capacity building]] and innovation policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>.
*   **Pipeline for Public Servants:** Universities create the pipeline of future civil servants and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. Stronger linkages are needed between governments and universities to target graduates, clarify opportunities in government, and attract talented individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.
*   **Research and Insight:** Universities can provide insights into identifying problems, generating new solutions (technology, policies, practices), and offering rigor in studying implementations and innovation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:39">[01:11:39]</a>.
*   **Policy Innovation:** There's an overlap between innovation policies and policy innovations, where universities can be more fluidly brought in to promote public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>. ENAP actively engages with universities and research centers, frequently using specialists in its innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>.

One initiative is to pilot public policies with universities to streamline the process of implementing and appraising pilot programs, making it faster and more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.

## The Political Dimension of Foresight
The work of [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | anticipatory innovation]] and foresight inherently involves political considerations and public values, especially due to the high uncertainty associated with future-oriented work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. In countries like Chile, the political nature of every actor's position is evident, particularly during significant national processes like drafting a new constitution, which itself represents an exercise in [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | anticipatory innovation]] from a political perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

## Challenges in Engaging Political Actors
Several challenges arise when attempting to integrate foresight into policy-making and engage political actors:

*   **Lack of Political Agreement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>: Small initiatives often fail to generate the necessary political consensus or funding to implement future-facing policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>.
*   **Short Political Cycles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>: Political cycles, typically 3-5 years, often conflict with the much longer time scales required to address complex future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.
*   **Demand for Quick Results**: Politicians often seek rapid outcomes, making it challenging to invest in the intangible, long-term nature of foresight and obtain funding for such initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Transparency**: There can be a reluctance from politicians to engage in transparent co-creation processes for various reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Biases**: Decision-makers may struggle with complexity, uncertainty, and exponential change, sometimes leading to avoidance of uncertainty, groupthink, or a general lack of imagination regarding potential futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.

## Incorporating Values and Desired Futures
The discussion of "desired futures" directly enters the value domain of politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. It becomes essential to:

*   **Explicitly Incorporate Values**: A key question is how to integrate values as an explicit part of the foresight process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>.
*   **Agree on Future Scenarios**: Society and politicians need to agree on a spectrum of possible future scenarios, determining which are seen as opportunities and which as risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.
*   **Communicate "Uncomfortable Knowledge"**: Foresight practitioners have a responsibility to communicate potentially uncomfortable or non-immediate knowledge about the future to decision-makers, even if it's not currently attention-grabbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.

## Strategies for Engagement
Despite the challenges, several strategies can help engage political actors and incorporate values:

*   **Bottom-Up Approach**: Starting with concrete cases and proving the value of different approaches can help gain buy-in from leadership and, eventually, politicians for larger systemic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.
*   **Open Innovation and Public Goods**: Offering future scenarios as a "public good" through an open innovation approach allows politicians, the productive sector, and academia to interpret and respond to them based on their own values and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.
*   **Inoculating Politicians**: There is "large margin to do innovative approaches to inoculate the politicians with [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | anticipatory innovation]] approach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.
*   **Stimulating Key Abilities**: Using tools and engaging people in practical ways can stimulate critical abilities like imagination, boldness, and prospection within public organizations, which are essential for navigating the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.
*   **Shifting from Linear to Non-Linear Thinking**: It's crucial to introduce less linear ways of thinking about the future, contrasting with the often linear, economically-driven approaches that tend to dominate discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.
*   **Stubbornness and Communication**: Persistence in communicating results, remaining motivated, and proving the value of implemented solutions can help spread belief in a new culture and overcome political resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

Foresight tools are not panaceas; they are platforms for asking questions and starting a process of learning by doing, rather than providing all the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>. Their purpose is to empower public organizations to imagine alternatives, conceive of sustainable societies, and equip them with the capacity to address future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

In a world undergoing continuous change, complex issues have become the norm, leading governments to increasingly look beyond their borders to develop solutions for global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This includes efforts ranging from ending pandemics and managing migration to reducing economic carbon dependency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, it is not yet clear how [[crossborder_government_collaboration_and_innovation | cross-border collaboration]] can be best achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. A key question is how governments can improve at innovating together for the public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Imperative for Cross-Border Innovation

The COVID-19 crisis dramatically altered life, accelerating digital transformation and the pace and scale of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. At the same time, it exposed pre-existing national vulnerabilities, highlighting a lack of preparedness among governments to tackle global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and disruptions in global value chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. While public sector innovation became a key tool for collective action during the pandemic, government innovation efforts largely remain confined to national and local borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The challenge is to understand why [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | collaboration at the global level]] isn't happening more often and how to break this paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Research and Insights on Collaboration

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed Bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation have partnered to determine how governments can best support cross-border collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Their extensive research included a global call for innovation, collecting insights and practices, and facilitating open global workshops on [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | cross-border innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Their first report, "Achieving Cross-Border Government Innovation," launched last month, highlighted that issues facing governments are increasingly complex and transnational, requiring existing governance mechanisms for international cooperation to adjust and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It also showed how governments are leveraging new governance structures, such as innovative governance bodies, horizontal networks, and coordinated systems approaches, to tackle cross-border issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

A second report, "Surfacing Insights and Experimenting Across Borders," focuses on ground-up approaches to [[international_collaboration_in_government_innovation | cross-border government innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

## Challenges and Success Factors for Cross-Border Innovation

A key challenge identified in cross-border government innovation is the prevalence of undeveloped ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. Other significant barriers include:
*   Cultural norms and resistance to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   Lack of feedback mechanisms and learning loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   Difficulties in understanding the costs and benefits for different partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.
*   Challenges in considering the scalability of projects during the design process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.
*   Legal and policy restrictions regarding financial awards in international collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.
*   The "handmade in combat" feeling for project managers who have to navigate complex agency processes (attorneys, public affairs, CIO shops) without a support structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

### Ground-Up Surfacing of Insights and Collective Intelligence
This involves taking existing approaches and applying them in new, cross-border, and global ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. This includes:
*   **Challenge initiatives and crowdsourcing exercises**: Mobilizing brain power efficiently using internet platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.
*   **Democratic citizens' assemblies**: Raising the scope to a transnational approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Harvesting knowledge from anywhere**: Assuming that the greatest ideas might not come from within the organization or traditional institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>.
*   **Organizing and orchestrating knowledge**: Documenting discoveries, putting them into journals and databases, embedding them in training, and gathering data from both successful and unsuccessful experiments to make the whole system more intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

### Experimenting and Testing Across Borders
This focuses on testing new ideas and finding different ways to scale solutions internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. It's about designing projects with scalability in mind from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Formal mechanisms like sandboxes and testbeds are crucial for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

## Examples of Cross-Border Collaboration

### Deep Space Food Challenge
An international collaboration between the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This challenge incentivizes innovation in food production technologies to meet the needs of space exploration and address terrestrial needs like reducing food insecurity on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. NASA and CSA run parallel prize competitions due to legal and policy restrictions, co-marketing and synchronizing announcements, but each government organizes its own distinct challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.

### Global Innovation Collaborative
A network and platform for [[collaboration_between_governments_and_citizens | collaborations]] through which city governments worldwide launch open innovation competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Cities like Paris, London, New York, and Berlin work together to host local challenges, such as the Creative Cities Challenge focused on COVID-19 recovery in the creative sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. These open calls not only seek winning ideas but also expose the public sector to the "art of the possible" by showcasing technological potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.

### UAE Government Accelerators
A methodology that accelerates the execution of strategic agendas and resolves challenges within 100 days or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>. This tool moves from ideation and innovation to accelerated implementation by empowering frontline employees and fostering collaborative work with a mix of people from different entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. The focus is on piloting innovative solutions in specific areas and then setting up a sustainability team to scale them up to similar areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>. This methodology has been shared with different countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.

### UAE Moonshot Programs
The UAE launched two key programs promoting cross-border collaboration:
*   **Moonshot Apprenticeship Program**: Launched in June 2021, it unites young minds, talents, and governments to tackle pressing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:35">[01:18:35]</a>. It pairs UAE nationals with international counterparts to develop moonshot projects under priority sectors like data economy, global talent, and global outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>.
*   **Moonshot Pilot Grant**: A call for the international community to test groundbreaking ideas in partnership with the UAE, with funding up to $100,000 per project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.

The UAE also joined six other nations in the [[international_collaboration_on_governance_innovation | Agile Nations Network]] to foster global cooperation on rulemaking in response to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:48">[02:08:48]</a>.

## The Future of Cross-Border Collaboration

Many of the largest challenges facing the world today are inherently cross-border, meaning that solutions cannot be achieved within national boundaries alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>. This necessitates increasing cooperation, working through procedural issues, and developing strong partnerships based on trust and openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>.

> [!quote] "We believe innovation in government should be an everyday practice. Our vision is to be among the most innovative governments in the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:08">[02:09:08]</a> - His Highness Sheikh Hamad Barashid Al-Maktoum, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>

[[Challenges and strategies for global collaboration | Collaboration]] will be crucial for addressing future global issues such as net zero carbon emissions, education, health, poverty, food security, water security, and unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>. This will likely involve "mini-lateralism" – collaborations among groups of countries around specific tasks, rather than solely through large multilateral organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. The focus will be on formalizing mechanisms, institutionalizing processes, and creating shared foundations of growth to avoid reinventing solutions from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>.

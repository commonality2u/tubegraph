Innovation in healthcare, particularly in areas like personalized medicine and cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, heavily relies on the strategic involvement of the public sector and robust international collaborations. This approach, often termed "mission-oriented innovation," seeks to tackle complex societal challenges through coordinated, purpose-driven efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Mission-Oriented Innovation: A Collaborative Imperative

Mission-oriented innovation refers to a coordinated package of policy and regulatory initiatives, platforms, and networks, specifically designed to mobilize science, technology, innovation, and beyond, to address a societal challenge in a precise way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. Key requirements for such missions include:
*   Ambitious and concrete goals with defined timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   Spanning multiple stages of the innovation cycle, from research and demonstration to market launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
*   Crossing various silos, including disciplinary, sectoral, and policy boundaries (between ministries, agencies, and communities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>.
*   Utilizing diverse support instruments, including both supply-side and demand-side approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

The essence of mission-oriented innovation lies in the integrated and tailored application of these elements to achieve a specific, overarching mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

### Opportunities and Challenges

[[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | Opportunities]] of this approach include:
*   Higher and broader engagement across various stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>.
*   Stronger direction towards public goods and increased momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>.
*   Improved policy coordination, leading to less overlap and more consistent plans across silos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.
*   An intentional policy mix and the pooling of resources and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.

However, [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | challenges]] persist:
*   Defining "real" missions that are bold, targeted, and measurable, avoiding "mission washing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>.
*   Moving beyond science and technology to achieve systemic behavioral and societal change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.
*   Managing complex multi-level and cross-ministerial governance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.
*   Engaging non-science, technology, and innovation (STI) stakeholders, including citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.
*   Measuring the impact of systemic interventions, for which methodologies and tools are still developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.
*   Scaling up successful pilot initiatives beyond specific subsystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

Addressing these challenges requires overcoming incumbent biases, fostering systemic change in infrastructure, and evolving fundamental approaches to data, regulation, and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>. It also demands a shift from a "quick win" mentality to a joint, ecosystem-wide portfolio approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.

## International Initiatives in Health Innovation

### European Union & Sweden: Combating Cancer

The European Union has launched the European Cancer Mission, with a deadline of 2030 to make a real difference in people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. This mission, alongside Europe's Beating Cancer Plan, aims to tackle the entire disease pathway, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and improving the quality of life for cancer survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>. The European Commission is establishing national mission hubs in every country to coordinate actions across local, regional, national, and European levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>.

Sweden, through its "Vision Zero Cancer" initiative, is leading by example in adopting an ecosystem purpose-driven approach to [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] in cancer care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This ambitious approach aims to shift the paradigm in healthcare towards personalized medicine, ensuring tailored, impactful approaches and equal access to diagnosis and treatment across Europe and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

#### Sweden's Success in Cancer Care

Sweden's cancer strategy, launched in 2009, established six regional cancer centers and fostered the development of patient-focused, accessible, equitable, and effective cancer care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:52">[01:16:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Key achievements include 50 national guidelines, over 30 standardized care pathways, approximately 30 registries, and 11 concentrations of highly specialized treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:24">[01:17:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. As a result, 85% of children and 70% of adult cancer patients in Sweden are long-term survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:53">[01:17:53]</a>.

Reasons behind Sweden's achievements include:
*   **Universal Healthcare**: Cancer care is free, as healthcare is a public responsibility and largely tax-financed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:45">[01:18:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>.
*   **[[Partnerships between public sector and private sector for innovation | Close Collaboration]]**: A long tradition of close cooperation between healthcare, academia, and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:55">[01:18:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   **Active Public Health Policy**: Prevention of lifestyle-related diseases, screening programs, HPV vaccination, and advanced diagnostic/treatment tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:11">[01:19:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:25">[01:19:25]</a>.
*   **[[Public Sector Innovation | Structured Care]]**: National quality registers, clinical guidelines, and multidisciplinary cancer management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.

The "Vision Zero Cancer" initiative (founded by a quintuple helix collaboration including industry, regional authorities, cancer centers, academia, and patient associations) acts as a "one-stop shop" for innovation in cancer care, moving from isolated initiatives to a more coordinated national approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:05">[02:24:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:15">[02:24:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:37">[02:24:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:42">[02:24:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:51">[02:24:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:57">[02:24:57]</a>. The "Testbed Sweden for Precision Health in Cancer" further stimulates clinical trials and the implementation of personalized medicine sustainably and equitably across Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:20">[02:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:32">[02:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:46">[02:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:53">[02:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:55">[02:00:55]</a>.

### Australia: Genomics Health Futures Mission

Australia's Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) supports eight research missions over 10 years, focusing on areas of unmet need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>. The Genomics Health Futures Mission, with A$500 million, aims to transform lives through genomic research to deliver better testing, diagnosis, and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:38">[01:19:38]</a>.

This mission emphasizes:
*   Accelerating research for more effective testing, diagnosis, and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.
*   Facilitating the adoption of new interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.
*   Consolidating Australia's international leadership in genomics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>.
*   Increasing community awareness and engagement, and understanding the societal and economic value of genomics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.

Challenges include managing conflicts of interest due to a small expert community, forecasting priorities over a 10-year timeframe, budget limitations, and translating overarching goals into specific short-, medium-, and long-term investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:05">[01:26:05]</a>. Lessons learned emphasize clear terms of reference for expert advisory panels, diverse membership (including international experts), and early evaluation mechanisms to refine the mission's path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:35">[01:29:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:37">[01:29:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:39">[01:29:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:59">[01:29:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:03">[01:30:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>.

### Germany: National Decade Against Cancer

As part of Germany's High-Tech Strategy 2025, the "National Decade Against Cancer" (launched 2019) is a 10-year, €1 billion initiative focusing on strengthening clinical cancer research and translating innovations into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:14">[01:37:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:23">[01:37:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:28">[01:38:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:11">[01:41:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:16">[01:41:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:22">[01:41:22]</a>.

Key aims include:
*   Reducing preventable cancer cases by 10% every 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:27">[01:39:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:29">[01:39:29]</a>.
*   Improving patient access by networking research institutes and high-quality hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:53">[01:39:53]</a>.
*   Improving communication with citizens regarding cancer prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.
*   Educating the next generation of cancer researchers and clinicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:18">[01:40:18]</a>.

The initiative involves various stakeholders, including medicine, research, patient groups, politics, regulatory authorities (national drug authorities), and the business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:45">[01:40:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:52">[01:40:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:54">[01:40:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:56">[01:40:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:57">[01:40:57]</a>. A key challenge is maintaining the engagement and common ownership of all stakeholders over 10 years, especially given particular interests and the need to change the culture of cancer research by stronger patient involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:56">[01:47:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:58">[01:47:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:03">[01:48:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:11">[01:48:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:16">[01:48:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:06">[01:49:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:08">[01:49:08]</a>.

### The Netherlands: Health and Care Missions

The Netherlands has a central mission for health and care, supported by four other missions covering topics from elderly care to chronic diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:26">[01:56:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:28">[01:56:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:31">[01:56:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:33">[01:56:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:36">[01:56:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:39">[01:56:39]</a>. [[Public and private collaboration in innovation | Health Holland]], one of the top sectors, coordinates the realization of these missions, involving 97 partners who collectively invest 1.1 billion euros annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:49">[01:56:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:52">[01:56:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:54">[01:56:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:02">[01:57:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:05">[01:57:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:11">[01:57:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:13">[01:57:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:15">[01:57:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:20">[01:57:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:23">[01:57:23]</a>.

A crucial aspect is the involvement of citizens and a quadruple helix approach, working at local, regional, and national scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:25">[01:57:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:28">[01:57:28]</a>. The strategy involves creating "field labs"—often physical, local initiatives where problems occur and co-creation with affected communities is fostered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:46">[01:58:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:47">[01:58:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:03">[01:59:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:07">[01:59:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:51">[02:07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:53">[02:07:53]</a>. These field labs allow for experimentation, sharing costs and risks, and building trust by connecting people and organizations across different layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:12">[01:59:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:14">[01:59:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:17">[01:59:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:30">[01:59:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:34">[01:59:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:39">[01:59:39]</a>. By starting at the "niche" level with local initiatives and connecting them to broader "regime" (infrastructure) and "landscape" (global trends) levels, the goal is to reach a tipping point where collective action leads to a new normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:02">[02:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:04">[02:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:08">[02:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:10">[02:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:12">[02:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:13">[02:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:14">[02:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:16">[02:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:19">[02:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:21">[02:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:27">[02:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:30">[02:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:33">[02:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:38">[02:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:40">[02:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:42">[02:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:44">[02:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:47">[02:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:49">[02:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:52">[02:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:56">[02:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>.

Camden Council, a local authority in London, has embarked on a "Food Mission" as part of its renewal strategy post-COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:34">[02:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:36">[02:17:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:38">[02:17:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:41">[02:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:43">[02:17:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:45">[02:17:45]</a>. The mission aims for "everyone in Camden to be healthy with nutritious, affordable, sustainable food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:34">[02:19:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:35">[02:19:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:36">[02:19:36]</a>. This addresses cross-cutting challenges like climate emergency, food poverty, and health inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:43">[02:19:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:44">[02:19:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:45">[02:19:45]</a>.

The mission is seen as a vehicle to grow a movement driven by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:57">[02:19:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:01">[02:20:01]</a>.

## The Future of Public Sector Innovation in Health

The ongoing efforts in Sweden, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK demonstrate that [[Public sector innovation and crosssector collaboration | public sector innovation]] and international collaboration are vital for addressing complex health challenges like cancer. While there are common [[roles_and_challenges_in_public_sector_innovation | challenges]] in defining missions, engaging diverse stakeholders, and measuring systemic impact, the commitment to learning, adapting, and fostering collaboration across all levels remains central to achieving ambitious health goals. The ability to translate high-level strategies into tangible local actions, while maintaining a shared vision, will be critical for future success in this evolving field.

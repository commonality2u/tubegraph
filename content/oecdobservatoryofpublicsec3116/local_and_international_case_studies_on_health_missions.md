## Vision Zero Cancer (Sweden)

**Overview**
Vision Zero Cancer is a vision-driven innovation milieu that unites actors across society in strategic collaborations to combat cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. While originating in Sweden, it holds a global ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. The initiative aims to shift the healthcare paradigm towards personalized medicine, ensuring tailored and effective approaches, and equitable access to cancer diagnosis and treatment worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Its ultimate vision is that no one should die of cancer, and more people should live longer and better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. This vision is targeted for realization by the end of 2030 in Sweden and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

**Structure and Activities**
Hosted jointly by Vision Zero Cancer and the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation, the initiative involves a diverse group of stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It is managed as a partnership coordinated by the Stockholm School of Economics' Research Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. Its foundation is a "quintuple helix" collaboration, bringing together healthcare, academia, industry, public sector authorities, and citizens/patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

Key activities include:
*   Creating a "one-stop shop" for innovation in cancer care in Sweden, aiming to move from isolated initiatives to a coordinated national contact point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.
*   Developing five areas with milestones to guide system renewal, focusing on prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.
*   Initiatives such as studying the cost-effectiveness of prevention, improving early symptom assessment in primary care, pushing for lung cancer screening, and introducing patient-reported outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   Co-hosting a national translational research partnership for precision medicine in cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.
*   Establishing "Testbed Sweden for Precision Health in Cancer" to stimulate clinical trials and implement personalized medicine across Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This testbed includes partnerships with Genomic Medicine Sweden, university hospitals, and regulatory agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.

**Challenges and Lessons Learned**
*   [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_health_missions | Challenges and strategies in implementing health missions]] include learning how to engage in new ways and developing effective mechanisms, tools, and practices for working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   The system is complex and adaptive; changes can have unpredictable ripple effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Missions provide an approach to move complex adaptive systems towards a more desirable state without destroying existing functional parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   Building a community of shared values and culture based on cooperation and learning is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.
*   It's important to understand the driving forces of individual actors while getting everyone to work for the greater whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.
*   Prioritizing actions: Vision Zero Cancer evaluates actions based on their contribution to the 2030 agenda, clear goals, expected results, user benefits, gender aspects, societal impact, and scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

## European Cancer Mission

**Overview**
The European Union has launched the European Cancer Mission, with an update provided just prior to the workshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>. There is a deliberate recognition that change needs to happen at both European and national levels, with a connection between these different scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. The European Commission is setting up national mission hubs in every country to coordinate local, regional, national, and European actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The deadline for making a real difference in people's lives through Europe's plan for beating cancer is 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Australian Genomics Health Futures Mission

**Overview**
The Australian Genomics Health Futures Mission is part of the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF), established in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:05">[01:16:05]</a>. The MRFF is a $20 billion fund, providing a long-term, sustainable source of research funding to transform health and medical research, improve lives, build the economy, and enhance health system sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>. The Genomics Health Futures Mission has a budget of $500 million over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

**Goals and Activities**
The mission's goal is to save or transform the lives of over 200,000 Australians through genomic research, delivering better testing, diagnosis, and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:19:34]</a>. It also aims to accelerate research for more effective testing, diagnosis, and treatment, facilitate new interventions, and strengthen Australia's international leadership in genomics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

Each MRFF mission, including Genomics Health Futures, focuses on an area of unmet need, is priority-led, planned, coordinated, and outcome-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. They aim to harness resources across the system through investment, leadership, and [[crossdisciplinary_collaboration_for_mission_success | collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.

The development of mission strategies involves:
*   An expert advisory panel, comprising diverse experts and consumers from across Australia, advises the minister on strategic priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.
*   These panels develop a roadmap (high-level goals) and an implementation plan (detailed strategy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>. The roadmap identifies priority areas for investment, covering both technological aspects and community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:12">[01:20:12]</a>.
*   Drafts undergo international review and public consultation before finalization and publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>.
*   Funding models include grants for national consortia and smaller incubator grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>.
*   Australian researchers can apply for these funding opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:03">[01:33:03]</a>.

**Challenges and Lessons Learned**
*   [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_health_missions | Challenges and strategies in implementing health missions]] include managing conflicts of interest, especially in a small community of experts where many also wish to conduct research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>.
*   Defining priorities within a 10-year timeframe and a limited budget (which varies greatly between missions) is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>.
*   Translating overarching goals into short, medium, and long-term investments that remain linked to the mission's objective is a significant task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:52">[01:26:52]</a>.
*   Identifying clear performance metrics and leveraging opportunities for increased impact are also challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>.
*   **Lessons:** Clear terms of reference for expert advisory panels are crucial, especially regarding budget constraints and scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:35">[01:29:35]</a>. Diverse membership, including international members, helps manage conflicts of interest and provides independent perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:59">[01:29:59]</a>. Early evaluation processes are critical for checking if grants meet mission objectives and for refining the path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>. Identifying and collaborating with non-financial partners in the sector helps leverage advocacy and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>. The adaptive approach is maintained through continuous gap analysis and early evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:46">[01:33:46]</a>.

## German National Decade Against Cancer

**Overview**
Germany's "National Decade Against Cancer" is a mission placed within the broader German High-Tech Strategy 2025, which aims to drive Germany's future through research and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:10">[01:37:10]</a>. Launched in January 2019, it is a 10-year, multi-stakeholder initiative with a budget of 1 billion euros over the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:08">[01:41:08]</a>. It seeks to tackle cancer as a major challenge, especially given the rising number of cases due to an aging population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:12">[01:38:12]</a>.

**Goals and Activities**
The strategic aims include:
*   Improving the lives of cancer patients through rapid translation of innovations into clinical practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.
*   Reducing preventable cancer cases in Germany by 10% every 10 years (e.g., from 40% to 36% by decade's end) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:24">[01:39:24]</a>.
*   Ensuring access to the highest quality cancer research and care for all patients nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:51">[01:39:51]</a>.
*   Improving communication with citizens, particularly regarding cancer prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>.
*   Educating the next generation of cancer researchers and clinicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:18">[01:40:18]</a>.

The initiative brings together key players from medicine, research, society (including patients), politics, health ministries, regulatory authorities (e.g., drug authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>), and the business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.
*   A high-level strategy committee, co-led by the federal ministry and the German Cancer Research Center, oversees the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:23">[01:42:23]</a>.
*   Working groups focus on grand challenges in cancer research, prevention, and networking research with care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:34">[01:44:34]</a>.
*   Significant funding programs have been launched for areas like practice-changing clinical trials, tumor heterogeneity, colon cancer prevention, and expansion of national tumor disease centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:22">[01:45:22]</a>.
*   A broad public dialogue collected thousands of individual feedbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:29">[01:46:29]</a>.
*   A new national center for cancer prevention is being built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:52">[01:46:52]</a>.
*   Principles for patient involvement have been defined, and Germany's participation in the Transcan research funders network has increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:10">[01:47:10]</a>.

**Challenges and Lessons Learned**
*   Maintaining stakeholder engagement and public attention for a 10-year mission is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:56">[01:47:56]</a>.
*   Aligning the mission's activities with the particular interests of diverse stakeholders (e.g., researchers, patients, industry, insurers) is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a>.
*   Fostering shared ownership across all partners, as some may not see direct benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:59">[01:48:59]</a>.
*   A major challenge is changing the culture of cancer research towards stronger patient involvement, making patient-oriented research the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:41">[01:49:41]</a>. This requires educating patients to be more directly involved, even in common decisions, and encouraging clinicians to take patient input as seriously as other medical professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:03">[01:53:03]</a>.

## Dutch Top Sector Policy for Life Sciences & Health Mission (Netherlands)

**Overview**
The Netherlands implements its health mission as part of its "Top Sector Policy for Life Sciences and Health," where a central mission for health and care is supported by four sub-missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:21">[01:56:21]</a>. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sports, is responsible for articulating and driving these missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:51">[01:55:51]</a>. Total investment into these missions is 1.1 billion euros annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:36">[01:57:36]</a>.

**Goals and Activities**
The missions cover diverse subjects, including elderly care, chronic diseases, and extramuralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:33">[01:56:33]</a>. Health Holland acts as the coordinator for the realization of these missions, working with a quadruple helix model involving researchers, entrepreneurs, government, knowledge institutes, and importantly, citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:52">[01:56:52]</a>.

Key to their approach is "co-creation" through "field labs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:46">[01:58:46]</a>.
*   **Field Labs:** These are physical places or initiatives where people work together on local problems, driven by a shared sense of urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:51">[01:58:51]</a>. They serve as incubation rooms for radical innovation and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:44">[02:01:44]</a>.
*   **Co-creation Model:** Beyond shared creation, this involves sharing costs, risks, and benefits within new governance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:34">[01:59:34]</a>. It embraces uncertainty regarding outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:48">[01:59:48]</a>.
*   **Multi-level Perspective:** The Dutch approach uses a "swapped" multi-level perspective, starting at the "niche" (local initiatives) and then expanding to connect with regional and national levels. "Birds" (actors) fly between layers to build trust and co-create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.
*   **Example: Hogeweyk (Dementia Village):** This open village for people with dementia literally shared its dream with the whole community (baker, municipality, tech entrepreneurs, school, neighbors), inviting contributions. This enabled residents to walk freely, supported by the community and technology, creating new connections and lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:31">[02:03:31]</a>.
*   **Scaling Up Field Labs:** Field labs must commit to the missions and make an impact for a population of at least 100,000 people, which makes them more appealing for health insurers and entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:49">[02:05:49]</a>. They involve existing teams and organizations, which then establish formal cooperation agreements and governance structures based on five key elements: monitoring, working together, learning together, ICT and data, and financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:02">[02:11:02]</a>.
*   **Learning Infrastructure:** Peer-to-peer learning infrastructures exist between field labs, and a national-to-field-lab learning infrastructure operates across different levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:50">[02:12:50]</a>.

**Challenges and Lessons Learned**
*   The biggest challenge is connecting national procedures and policymakers with local initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:58">[02:13:58]</a>. This involves overcoming differences in language and "tempo" (local level wants quick fixes, national level operates on longer timescales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:15">[02:14:15]</a>.
*   Encouraging regional actors to repeatedly share their stories on national platforms, despite potential frustration, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:56">[02:14:56]</a>.
*   Experiencing resistance, especially from local initiatives who may be skeptical of governmental stories about missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:12">[02:10:12]</a>. Building trust between different layers is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:35">[02:10:35]</a>.

## Camden Council's Food Mission (UK)

**Overview**
Camden Council, a local authority in London, has embarked on a mission-oriented approach to address societal challenges, particularly related to health and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:38">[02:16:38]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted existing structural inequalities and the disproportionate impact on certain populations, including health poverty and food insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:01">[02:18:01]</a>.

**Goals and Activities**
The "Camden Renewal Commission" was established as an advisory body, co-chaired by a UCL innovation expert and a Camden Council leader. It comprised a diverse group from the community, voluntary sectors, and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:52">[02:18:52]</a>. The commission gathered real-life experiences and used data to deliberate on missions, resulting in four key missions for Camden's renewal, one of which focuses on food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:13">[02:19:13]</a>.

The food mission statement is: "fighting effectively everyone is wealthy with nutritious affordable sustainable food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:34">[02:19:34]</a>. This mission aims to address climate emergency, food poverty, and inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:46">[02:19:46]</a>. Missions are seen as vehicles to grow a movement, starting with a political decision by the council, then engaging partners, and continuously being driven by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:54">[02:19:54]</a>.

To guide [[mission_setting_and_implementation_strategies | mission implementation]], Camden uses a "mission on a page" framework to capture components like the mission's story, problems to solve, system analysis, opportunity areas, tools/levers, and success metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:18">[02:21:18]</a>. They launched a bottom-up funding scheme for resident-led initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:21">[02:24:21]</a>.

**Challenges and Lessons Learned**
*   **Uncertainty:** Missions operate in conditions of amplitude and uncertainty. It's challenging to plan activities and influence other actors when outcomes are not fully known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:05">[02:22:05]</a>. Communicating this to internal and external stakeholders, who may interpret it as a lack of confidence, requires strong storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:15">[02:22:15]</a>.
*   **Balancing Urgency and Long-Term View:** There's tension between the immediate need for results (e.g., food poverty now) and the long-term, systemic change missions aim for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:36">[02:22:36]</a>.
*   **Defining Roles:** Continuously defining the role of missions, both internally and externally, is an ongoing journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:51">[02:22:51]</a>. Missions can change and take on different roles, such as enabling infrastructure for learning and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:09">[02:23:09]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability and Inclusivity:** Successful mission implementation requires a degree of vulnerability, listening to diverse voices, deliberating openly, and being receptive to criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:27">[02:23:27]</a>. This fosters inclusivity.
*   **Internal Culture Change:** Overcoming resistance from internal stakeholders, who may see missions as additional burdens, requires convincing them that missions enable their existing services and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:50">[02:23:50]</a>.
*   **Speeding Up Processes:** The traditional, often convergent, decision-making processes within local authorities can hinder the quick scaling of good ideas from bottom-up initiatives. New, untraditional decision-making processes are being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>.
*   **Political Support:** Strong senior leadership backing and continuous support are crucial, especially if the leadership understands and accepts the inherent uncertainty of missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:44">[02:24:44]</a>.
*   **Language Matters:** Using language that is encouraging and inclusive, rather than technical jargon, is vital for broad engagement and to avoid sounding like "another strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:20">[02:25:20]</a>.
*   **Scaling Local Impact:** The challenge of making a local impact when many areas are influenced by higher-level policies (e.g., central government) is addressed through lobbying and building coalitions for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:27">[02:26:27]</a>.
*   **Building Resilience:** Continuous communication and internal validation help build organizational resilience despite resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:10">[02:28:10]</a>. Leadership's willingness to pivot and rethink processes when they stop serving residents is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_public_sector_and_international_collaborations_in_health_innovation | Role of public sector and international collaborations in health innovation]]:** The council's role can shift from merely supplying services or funding to being a partnership and network builder, creating infrastructure for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:06">[02:29:06]</a>.
*   **Next Steps:** Future focus includes developing an outcomes framework, formalizing multi-disciplinary teams into governance structures, and establishing processes for cross-border learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:50">[02:25:50]</a>.

The Co-creation Bootcamp gathered 100 participants from the public sector, private sector, academia, and civil society organizations to collaboratively develop solutions for civic participation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These challenges were presented by public sector teams from Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands, with the aim of collaborating with society and leveraging emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The overarching goal was to center people in the solutions and utilize technologies such as AI, blockchain, and VR to enhance democratic participation, promoting more inclusive and accessible governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Design Sprint Approach

To transition from identified challenges to [[experimentation_and_policy_prototyping | prototype solutions]], participants worked in teams following a process designed by the OECD, structured as a design sprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This structured approach facilitated the [[developing_innovation_proposals | development of innovation proposals]] through several key stages.

### 1. Challenge Alignment

The initial phase required teams to align on the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This involved a deep understanding of the problem, its context, and any prior attempts to resolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Teams also identified key stakeholders, users, potential implementation barriers, and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This ensured a shared understanding and clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### 2. Ideation

Following challenge alignment, teams moved into ideation, brainstorming, discarding, and discussing ideas to generate and prioritize solutions addressing the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### 3. Solution Sketching and Refinement

The most promising ideas were further developed into well-articulated solution sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Teams used quick drawings to give shape and form to their solutions on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. After sketching, teams reviewed and refined these ideas, narrowing down possibilities to select the most viable idea for prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Prototype Creation

The second day of the bootcamp was entirely dedicated to creating a prototype of the selected solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Development Process

Teams began by developing a minimal prototype canvas based on their sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. They explored various approaches for prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>:
*   Some teams utilized [[digital_advancements_and_accessibility_challenges_in_public_innovation | digital tools and emerging technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Others opted for traditional materials such as Legos and modeling clay to quickly achieve a tangible representation of their solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Final Pitches and Selection

As time concluded, teams prepared five-minute pitches to showcase the prototypes they had built over the two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. These presentations were made to other participants and a jury of experts from Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Following the pitches, three solutions were chosen for further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. These selected prototypes were recognized for pushing the boundaries of civic participation through the integration of emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

The ideas generated and prototyped during the bootcamp are intended to shape the future of civic participation across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

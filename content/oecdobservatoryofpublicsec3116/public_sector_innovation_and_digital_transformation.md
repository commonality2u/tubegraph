The Observatory of [[Innovation in Public Sector|Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) launched a new innovation primer on "Rules as Code" to explore different ways of working for the [[Innovation in Public Sector|public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This event is part of OPSI's efforts to uncover what's next in [[Innovation in Public Sector|public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The report, "Cracking the Code: Rulemaking for Humans and Machines," is available in English and French <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI)

OPSI was established to achieve three main goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
*   Help governments identify emerging trends and their implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Facilitate the mainstreaming of new approaches into core practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Serve as a trusted source of advice for governments on adopting a deliberate, consistent, and reliable approach to [[public sector innovation|public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Rules as Code: A New Approach to Rulemaking

Rules as Code represents a new, exciting concept that re-thinks the core government function of rule-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. It involves creating an official, machine-consumable version of rules, going beyond traditional communication to humans and natural language versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This allows rules to be understood and acted upon by computer systems consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

This initiative is seen as being at the heart of the [[public_sector_innovation_trends|public debate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, especially in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, which has accelerated trends like [[role_of_digital_advancements_in_public_sector_innovation|rapid digital transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

>[!DEFINITION] Rules as Code (as an approach)
>Rules as code, as an approach, is conceived as strategic, deliberate, and systemic. It involves designing and creating machine-consumable rules from the very beginning of their creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. This contrasts with viewing rules as code merely as an output, where existing natural language rules are later translated into code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.

### Benefits and Opportunities
If adopted at scale, rules as code could significantly change how governments create, disseminate, and enforce rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Potential benefits include:
*   Enabling greater policy modeling by government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   Making it easier for people to understand their rights and obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   Improving compliance with rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Bridging the "translation gap" between written legislation and its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, which can lead to significant cost savings (e.g., banks saving millions if regulations were available as APIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.
*   Facilitating automated monitoring, pattern analysis, and intelligence gathering on the impact and effectiveness of regulation and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   Enabling multi-disciplinary teams (policy, legal, tech, users) to test and rapidly implement new policies in an agile way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.
*   Shaping society and economy by considering machines as users of rules, requiring new security, monitoring, and intervention paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.
*   Designing better futures by moving from legacy rules to policies that are rapid, iterative, and test-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.
*   Increasing transparency and accountability by improving traceability from decisions back to the underlying law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Digital Transformation

Mati Schneider highlights that the main [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_public_sector_digital_transformation|challenge]] for rules as code is the same as for any [[role_of_digital_advancements_in_public_sector_innovation|digital transformation]]: the legitimacy of building interdisciplinary teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. It requires drafters and coders to work together, breaking down silos within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

>[!WARNING] Risk of Technocratic Fantasy
>The goal of rules as code is not to automate everything or to create a "technocratic fantasy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>. It's about improving the quality of public service delivery by freeing up civil servants from easily automatable tasks so they can focus on complex cases requiring human intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.
>
>Furthermore, there is a risk of confusion between rules as code and using machine learning based on past jurisprudence, which could repeat historical mistakes or biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>. Rules as code, in contrast, aims for increased transparency and understandable rules through a strong link between legislation and the code expressing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.

### Learning from International Experiences
[[public_sector_innovation_and_collaboration|Learning from international experiences]] is crucial for [[public_sector_innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>.

*   **France:** Started with a concrete experience, building software like "Open Fisca" to simulate the impact of legal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This open-sourced software became a basis for tools that help citizens understand their rights and obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. It enabled not only the [[public sector innovation|public sector]] but also NGOs and private companies to contribute rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Tools like "Lex Impact" are being considered to make the impact of changes more readable and predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **New Zealand:** The "Better Rules" initiative brought global attention to rules as code, stemming from a more theoretical background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. New Zealand's focus was on understanding the feedback loop between rules and their impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Canada:** Has been striving to catch up with advancements in France and New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.

### Starting the Journey
To begin with rules as code, it's important to start with potential impact and be driven by use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. It's not about transforming the entire legal apparatus overnight but finding specific areas where rules as code can address a clear need, such as an area undergoing massive changes or where improving service delivery is a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. The advice is to "start small, prototype, iterate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

## Policy Transformation: Beyond Rules as Code
Rules as code is a small but necessary part of a broader shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>. The traditional, linear policy cycle is often not iterative or test-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. Policy-making needs to become more about identifying opportunities, learning, ideating, prototyping, testing, and continuously iterating with multi-disciplinary teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This ensures that new policies are implemented only after knowing they work, not just based on academic modeling or hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.

This transformation is also about rebalancing drafting approaches, acknowledging that both prescriptive and principles-based rules have their place, depending on whether clear, consistent implementation or interpretation is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.

Ultimately, this work highlights the need for governments to be resilient, effective, and responsive to the exponential speed of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>. The goal is to move towards an "augmented [[Innovation in Public Sector|public sector]]" that leverages both human and machine capabilities to thrive in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. This requires a fundamental shift in government organization and culture, moving towards greater transparency, collaboration with civil society, and open-source practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>.

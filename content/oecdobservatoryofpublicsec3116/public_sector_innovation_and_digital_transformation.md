The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) plays a crucial role in advancing [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Its mandate involves helping governments identify future trends, understand their implications, embed new practices into core operations, and provide reliable advice on a consistent approach to [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. OPSI's work falls under the umbrella of "uncovering what's next," exploring concepts like "Rules as Code" as a pathway to different ways of working for the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## Key Trends and Concepts

OPSI regularly produces working papers that offer trusted advice on emerging [[public_sector_innovation_trends | trends]] in the [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]] and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. The *Cracking the Code: Rulemaking for Humans and Machines* primer is the 42nd working paper on public governance and the third in the OPSI series focused on [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. These primers introduce emerging issues, concepts, new approaches, and [[public_sector_innovation_trends | trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has intensified many ongoing trends, including rapid [[public_sector_digital_transformation | digital transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This environment necessitates ambitious ideas such as "Rules as Code," which are central to current public debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

### The Role of Rules as Code in Innovation

Rules as Code is an exciting new concept that re-thinks a core function of government: rule-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. It involves creating an official, machine-consumable version of rules, going beyond traditional human-readable natural language versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This allows rules to be understood and acted upon consistently by computer systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

If adopted at scale, Rules as Code could profoundly change how governments create, disseminate, and enforce rules, leading to improved compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. It can enable greater policy modeling by governments and make it easier for people to understand their rights and obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

Rules as Code can be understood in two ways:
*   **As an output:** A coded version of rules that computers can understand and use. Coded rules already exist today, created by businesses, individuals, and governments based on natural language versions, for systems like online tax returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **As an approach:** A strategic, deliberate, and systemic method of conceiving and creating machine-consumable rules from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This approach transforms how, when, why, and for whom rules are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

This concept is still in an early stage, requiring further testing and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. The primer aims to mobilize diverse actors from government, the [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]], and academia to advance this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

## The Journey of Innovation and Digital Transformation

[[public_sector_digital_transformation | Digital transformation]] requires a junction between top-down and bottom-up [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] to deliver effective change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

### French Experience
In France, the journey began with the treasury and Ministry of Finance seeking simulation software to understand the impact of legal changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. A deliberate decision was made to open-source this work, leading to the creation of "OpenFisca" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. This open-sourced software, originally for simulation, was reused by the public sector to create tools that help citizens understand their rights, entitlements (e.g., benefits), and obligations (e.g., taxes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

New contributors joined, including French administration officials, NGOs, and private companies, implementing additional rules and improving the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. This collaborative effort was driven by concrete use cases, not abstract fantasies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. Benefits included identifying "gray areas" in legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

### New Zealand Experience
New Zealand's "Better Rules" initiative brought global attention to Rules as Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. Their approach was more theoretical, outlining concepts that France initially lacked in implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. New Zealand emphasized the feedback loop between policy models and law evolution, which France later understood better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Opportunities in Public Service
A major challenge is the "translation gap" between written legislation and practical implementation, often relying on lawyers as "very expensive and quite variable modems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:00">[32:06:00]</a>. This can lead to incorrect or inconsistent application of rules, costing millions and creating inequities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>.

Governments need to adapt to new digital paradigms by involving multi-disciplinary teams in policy development, including policy experts, legislators, service designers, technologists, end-users, and data specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:47:00">[32:47:00]</a>. This collaborative approach enables rapid, agile, and test-driven policy creation, ensuring high confidence in intended impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:08:00">[34:08:00]</a>.

Another critical aspect is recognizing machines as users of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>. As machines are not responsive to legal, financial, or criminal pressures, ensuring rules are designed for them helps create new security, monitoring, and intervention paradigms suitable for the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>.

The traditional linear policy cycle is often ineffective in a fast-paced digital world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a>. A shift towards iterative, test-driven, and co-designed policy processes is needed, where policies are only scaled and implemented after they are proven to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>.

### Rules as Code: Current vs. Future State
Currently, different interpretations and implementations of rules lead to limited reuse and conflicting outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>. The future state involves co-drafting policy intent, concept models, and logic flows, along with human and machine-readable rules simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:00">[37:11:00]</a>. This allows for testing in reality and immediate availability of legislation as an API once enacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:00">[37:34:00]</a>. This approach leads to higher confidence, better automation, and improved testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:00">[37:51:00]</a>.

### Starting the Journey
To begin the [[public_sector_digital_transformation | digital transformation]] journey with Rules as Code, it is essential to:
1.  **Start with potential impact:** Focus on use cases that directly benefit stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:07">[56:07]</a>.
2.  **Find specific areas of need:** Identify subsets of legislation or rules undergoing massive changes, or areas where improving service delivery is a key goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:40">[57:40]</a>.
3.  **Involve all actors:** Engage relevant institutions and individuals by demonstrating tangible "carrots" rather than abstract notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:34">[58:34]</a>.
4.  **Start small, prototype, and iterate:** This agile approach is effective for transforming government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:51">[58:51]</a>.

It's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of Rules as Code; it's not about automating all rules or replacing human judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The goal is not to have criminal justice delivered by robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>, nor is it about relying on machine learning based on jurisprudence that could perpetuate past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>. Instead, it aims for:
*   Increased transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>
*   More understandable rules for humans and machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>
*   Strong traceability between legislation and its expression in code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>
*   Enabling citizens to test how laws apply to different scenarios through exercisable code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>

This shift is not merely technical but requires a mindset and organizational change within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. It emphasizes breaking silos, harnessing the intelligence of civil society, and fostering collaboration between economists, developers, and policy officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>. Open-sourcing existing coded rules and creating governance that allows citizens and other agencies to participate are vital steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

The pursuit of Rules as Code is a fundamental part of the broader [[public_sector_innovation_and_government_transformation | public sector innovation and government transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. It's about moving from a broken policy-service continuum to a responsive, resilient, and effective government that can serve citizens better in a rapidly changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>. The conversation around Rules as Code needs to contribute to the concept's development and help it reach its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>. This is as much about [[public_sector_innovation | public administration]] and human engagement as it is about technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:19">[01:18:19]</a>.

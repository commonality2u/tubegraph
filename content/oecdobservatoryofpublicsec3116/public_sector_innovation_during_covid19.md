The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the critical need for more [[public_sector_innovation | innovative]] and agile governments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The crisis highlighted that [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] requires a deliberate, mission-oriented, and systemic approach to effectively address problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The OECD's Observatory of [[public_sector_innovation | Public Sector Innovation]] (OPSI) is actively involved in uncovering emerging [[public_sector_innovation_trends | trends]] in [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]], embedding promising practices, and providing trusted advice for a deliberate and consistent approach to [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Diverse Innovative Responses

The OPSI, with assistance from the Centre for Public Impact and G-Insider, launched an Innovative Response Tracker, collecting over 250 examples of varied scope and innovativeness within seven weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The responses observed include:
*   **Structural Responses and Longer-Term Shifts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>: Examples include rescue packages for national airlines incorporating climate change ambitions as a condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Solidarity Platforms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>: Governments and non-government actors created platforms to facilitate volunteering and community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Regional Perspectives on Innovation

#### Portugal
[[government_innovation_during_covid19 | Innovation in Portugal]] during the crisis has been threefold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>:
*   **Inside-Out State Response**: The state created "Estamos On" (We Are On It), a central hub portal providing reliable, up-to-date information on legal initiatives, public service workings, and direct digital services via ePortugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This platform also helped companies access support programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Outside-In Civil Society Contributions**: Platforms like "Tech for COVID-19", a community of over 5,000 professionals, developed solutions such as free online consultation video channels, apps, and platforms to help local commerce sell online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   **Intra-State Collaborative Work**: A collaborative work plan for public administration led to 22 projects by 27 public entities and civil society organizations, producing guides for crisis leadership, promoting [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] via an Innovation Barometer, and disseminating information strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This showcased the potential of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] in delivering value and confirmed the reality of an [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] ecosystem with active, sometimes latent, connections between stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>.

#### Denmark
Denmark experienced a relatively mild COVID-19 crisis, with a faster flattening of the curve than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. The unemployment rate rose from 4.7% in early March to 6.3% in late April, with disproportionate impact on municipalities already struggling with social and financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Innovative responses include:
*   **Communication and Product Innovations**: Known channels were used differently, such as the prime minister holding press conferences for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>, and government using influencers to reach broader audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.
*   **Rapid Technology Implementation**: Lightning-fast implementation of technologies like video consultations with GPs and chatbots for quick COVID-19 related questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
*   **Service Innovations**: A municipality helped develop a local e-commerce platform for shops without an online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Organizational and Process Innovations**: Collaboration stood out, from companies and volunteers 3D printing face shields to the health system (regional hospitals and municipal home care) demonstrating better collaboration than in years of discussions on structural reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Doctors advocated for building on current practices rather than old reform papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
*   **Digital Transformation Leap**: A "quantum leap" in [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | digital transformation]] occurred despite Denmark's already strong digital starting point, with high internet usage, mobile banking, and digital government interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. The infrastructure for remote work was largely in place, requiring mostly capacity scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. Public sector organizations that had recently implemented tools like Microsoft Teams quickly found their purpose during lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Libraries are exploring becoming "libraries in the cloud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. Communication between government and citizens saw "next level" digital changes, such as social workers using Signal and Teams to reach young people without email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

#### South Africa
South Africa's case numbers were similar to Denmark's, with 7,808 confirmed positive cases and 153 deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, defying earlier pessimism about Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. Innovations include:
*   **Context-Specific Reactions**: Rwanda rapidly rolled out handwashing facilities at public transport hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. Ghana repurposed its Zipline drone vaccine delivery system to deliver test kits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.
*   **Repurposing Existing Capacity**: Existing screening programs for HIV, TB, malaria, and Ebola were utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. Community health workers were trained and deployed for screening and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. TB testing machines in rural areas were repurposed for COVID-19 testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.
*   **Social Media Campaigns**: Hashtag campaigns like "listen to the doctors" and "listen to the experts" were used, with daily videos from experts and ministers' briefings, to build trust and provide technical detail behind decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_opportunities_of_public_sector_innovation_in_a_crisis | Challenges and Opportunities of Public Sector Innovation in a Crisis]]

A crisis can be conducive to [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] by creating an overriding message that change is necessary and dissolving biases towards existing, often inadequate, solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. New ways of working are invested in and supported, and unusual actions become normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.

However, the experience of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] during a crisis is ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>:
*   **Easier Aspects**: A "quantum leap" in [[public_sector_innovation_and_digital_transformation | digital transformation]] occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>. The crisis solves the "guardian knot" problem, forcing hands-on action and showing the potential of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] in delivering value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. It has increased the legitimacy of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector Innovation]], proving it's a necessity, not a luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. Individuals are more motivated to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>, and social innovators (makers, civic tech movements) have stepped up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. Barriers that were previously difficult to overcome in government departments have been broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.
*   **Harder Aspects**: Systems in "crisis mode" centralize decision-making at the top, potentially distancing decisions from specific frontline knowledge and possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] work unrelated to the crisis may take a backseat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. There's a risk of siloification, where innovations in one sector don't synchronize with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. Competency in using appropriate tools has been problematic, especially at the organizational level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.

### Managing Multiple Timeframes for Innovation

Governments must operate across immediate, recovery, and long-term timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. The crisis has revealed that normal planning processes are insufficient for recurring crises, necessitating a reimagining of the public service, country, and economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. A scenario approach helps in building future plans and integrating anticipatory governance and [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>.

The crisis provides opportunities to re-evaluate services and what is truly important, such as redefining national health strategy by removing tensions between public and private sector healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>. While the immediate crisis dominates attention, there is a slow shift towards thinking beyond it, with government clusters already considering long-term plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:12">[00:54:12]</a>.

A conceptual framework for timeframes in a crisis response suggests four stages:
1.  **Emerging Crisis**: Focus on traditional health and safety preparation, with politicians making decisions like lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.
2.  **Crisis Mode**: High degree of crisis mode with centralized decisions and immediate health/societal solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>. This transitions into everyday living with the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.
3.  **Opening/Post-Crisis**: Adapting, changing, and figuring out what parts of the "new normal" and "old normal" will persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>.
4.  **New Reality**: A future state (estimated 9-24 months after the crisis) where a new normal is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.

### Challenges in Managing Multiple Timeframes

*   **Urgency Hijack**: The initial phase is dominated by urgent, fast solutions, creating a "tunnel effect" where other ongoing crises and long-term implications are ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. It's crucial to counteract this "presentism tendency" and make solutions sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   **Nostalgia of Normality**: Some desire to return to the pre-crisis normal, but the objective should be to build a *new* normal that is better than the previous one, as the crisis has made this more urgent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.
*   **Blame Game and Wishful Thinking**: The crisis can lead to a "blame game" that hinders rational discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>. Conversely, some exhibit wishful thinking, expecting the crisis to magically solve all problems, which overlooks the need for continuous experimentation and learning from errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>.
*   **Expertise vs. Public Debate**: While medical and technological solutions are powerful, they are not a substitute for public debate and citizen engagement in shaping the "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

### Building The New Normal

To build a sustainable future and embed [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]:
*   **Evidence-Based Decision-Making**: Stop guessing what the new normal will be and use evidence-based processes, triangulating qualitative and quantitative data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>. Data needs to be systematized and analyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.
*   **Reinvest in Innovation Ecosystems**: Continue the transfer of knowledge and collaboration with [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] ecosystems, which have proven vital during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.
*   **Focus on Usage, Not Just Output**: Many good solutions exist; the challenge is ensuring their actual use and sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>. Innovations must be user-centered and inclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.
*   **Responsible Innovation and Foresight**: Innovating means thinking about consequences. Utilizing foresight and anticipatory methodologies helps in anticipating desired outcomes and mitigating undesired ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.
*   **Embrace Experimentation**: [[public_sector_innovation | Innovation]] involves experimentation, testing, failing, and learning to improve and reduce risk before full implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.

## Impact on Public Servants and Future of Innovation

The crisis has been an intense "training ground" for [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] for public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>. It served as a massive laboratory for testing, improving, and customizing user-centered solutions, and a stress test for the old normal of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. This period acted as a catalyst and accelerator for a paradigm shift, or a "bureaucratic revolution," built on a long, silent accumulation of small changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>.

To prevent reverting to old defaults, it is crucial to identify "tipping points" and push the system towards a new, stable state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>. The crisis offers an opportunity to re-evaluate values and build new trust in government, shifting from a command-and-control approach to a more socially active way of managing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>. It's vital to:
*   **Act Now**: The time to have discussions about the new reality is now, while the crisis is still recent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>.
*   **Empower Leaders**: Innovative leaders can drive change by engaging users and utilizing tools like design thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.
*   **Connect and Legitimise**: Connect different parts of the system that want to learn and have discussions, making it legitimate to question and change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>.
*   **Emphasize New Narratives**: Highlight stories that emphasize the new normal and show the cracks in the old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>.

The crisis has brought [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] to the forefront of government priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:25">[01:22:25]</a>. Future efforts should focus on strengthening institutional capability and advocating for [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] to be on par with other government priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>. There needs to be "less [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] theater" and "more dirty hands" to practice [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] in all crises, especially the climate change crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:56">[01:27:56]</a>.

Public administration has shown an extraordinary capacity for adaptation and problem-solving in unprecedented challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:23">[01:25:23]</a>, proving it is "better than its reputation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>. The crisis has fostered a "collective resonance" among citizens and public servants, demonstrating an impressive capacity to engage and work on the front lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>. This moment should be used to build a participatory state where collaboration is the "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>.

> [!tip] Key Takeaway
> The crisis is not over, but it is the beginning of something new, requiring a long-term balance between returning to old normal, retaining proven new concepts, and seizing the opportunity for fundamental paradigm shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>. The work is ongoing, and solutions must be continuous engagements to solve immediate and emerging problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:53">[01:26:53]</a>.

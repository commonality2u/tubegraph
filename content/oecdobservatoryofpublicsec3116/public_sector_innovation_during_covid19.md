The COVID-19 crisis has provided a new impetus to [[public_sector_innovation | innovation practice]] worldwide, heightening its sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Experts are sharing insights on the crisis and its revelations about the evolving nature of [[Public sector innovation | public sector innovation]], as well as what governments can expect now and in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The objective is to push the boundaries of conventional approaches to spur lasting transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

A poll conducted during a session asked if the COVID-19 pandemic and associated crisis has made [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] something to be expected instead of questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The results showed 50% answered "yes," 11% "no," and 38.9% responded "too early to tell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Key Learnings and Reflections

#### The Importance of Listening
Nadine Smith from the Center for Public Impact highlights that a major learning from the pandemic is the failure to deeply or "radically" listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Decision-making has often been based on an outdated idea that governments inherently know what to do, which has proven to be a fallacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Existing mechanisms for listening are inadequate, and participative democracy remains immature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Assumptions about how people live were incorrect, leading to unintended harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Government systems often lack empathy, compassion, and are not optimized for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

When listening is done well, trust grows, relationships flourish, and positive outcomes can emerge even in difficult circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The goal should be to listen for learning, not for blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The new role of government is to enable spaces for listening, learning, and collaboration to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Communities have demonstrated the ability to create these spaces for faster and better feedback loops, even amidst centralized governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. It's crucial to avoid returning to a state where listening is primarily for control or extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

#### Working with Existing Infrastructure and Trust
Julio Quoto from the UNDP notes that in an emergency, governments work with what they have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Countries that had made prior investments in basic and fundamental infrastructure had more options for improvisation and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. For example, some African countries responded remarkably well by building on protocols established during the Ebola crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, and countries with existing digital safety nets were better able to stretch their limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Physical infrastructure also proved adaptable, with India repurposing railway cars as ambulances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

In conditions of high social capital and trust, new opportunities for [[public_sector_innovation_and_collaboration | collaboration]] emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Examples include public-private partnerships in Korea and low-cost testing development in Vietnam through collaboration between research centers and the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. The pandemic exacerbated issues in areas with low trust or poor basic infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

#### Acceleration of Pre-Existing Debates and the Policy Overton Window
Matthew Taylor, CEO of the RSA, describes the pandemic as an "unprecedented global experiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. He notes that the developing world has, in some ways, performed better than the developed world, which could challenge complacency in advanced public service and policymaking systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. The crisis highlighted the importance of functional redundancy, as systems operating at 100% capacity struggle with increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

Crises lead to change when there was existing momentum and capacity for change, when the crisis prefigures the future, and when there are ideas and coalitions to seize the opportunity as minds are open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. The pandemic has accelerated two major debates in public services:
1.  **Policymaking:** Traditional national government policymaking tends to be "scattergun" and "path dependent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. The crisis showed different forms of policymaking, with policies made and enacted more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. This accelerates a shift towards a mindset of "thinking like a system, acting like an entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
2.  **Public Services Model:** The "massive Global failed experiment" of new public management was already in decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. The crisis has brought two competing forces:
    *   A technocratic imperative, evidenced by advancements in digital public services, analytical skills, and targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
    *   The inadequacy of a transactional public services model, emphasizing the importance of moving to a relational model where public services result from collaboration between state, citizen, and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
    The key question is whether these two imperatives can combine to create a new model for public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

Brenton Calthin of States of Change describes the pandemic as "one of the largest natural comparative public policy experiments" in 90 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. The virus is a constant, creating both opportunities and challenges across public health, economy, trade, and international movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. Policy options have expanded, with measures once deemed unacceptable now tolerated or welcomed by the public (e.g., social distancing, free child care, universal basic income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. The "social contract" is fluid, and new muscles are being built in the relationship between citizens and the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

#### Challenges to Sustaining Innovation
There is concern that the deep incentive structures in politics and government may not have fundamentally changed, and that the push for innovation might subside once the immediate crisis, possibly with a vaccine, passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. There is a fear of "snapping back to normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

However, some undeniable truths may force continued change:
*   The complexity of current problems, which existing public management models have failed to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.
*   The widespread experience of poverty and economic insecurity during the pandemic, even among those previously prosperous, which could drive demand for different policy approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>.
*   The revelation that perceived "artificial constraints" on public finance were less rigid than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>. The crisis exposed underfunded areas (e.g., aged care), revealing these as strategic choices rather than absolute limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

### Unleashing Talent and Shifting Leadership
The pandemic has highlighted the need to unleash talent within government. The crisis has forced organizations to operate in flatter, less hierarchical ways, with many traditional systems falling by the wayside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. This has been liberating, showing that organizations can cope without elaborate performance management systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>. The challenge is to maintain this openness and ability to take insight from different directions in a post-COVID stable environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>.

Key aspects of talent development and leadership for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] include:
*   **Improvisation:** This has become a crucial skill, allowing individuals from lower ranks to take on important tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>.
*   **Reflectivity and Humility:** The personal impact of the disease has reconnected many civil servants to their original purpose, fostering a sense of humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.
*   **Addressing Exhaustion:** The "utter exhaustion" across many government levels highlights the need to understand conditions for well-being in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.
*   **Leadership Focus on "Being" over "Doing":** Workforces are calling for leaders to focus on values, behaviors, and relationships rather than just being busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>. Inspirational leadership that connects with the workforce and creates safe learning environments is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.

### The Role of Narrative and International Bodies
There is a need for a coherent narrative, potentially from influential and inspirational leaders, to guide this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. The OECD, as a major institution, is advised to invest less in content and more in relationships, enabling people to connect, strengthen networks, and foster [[public_sector_innovation_and_collaboration | collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>. It should use its platform to advocate for "next generation governance," decision-making, and public sector management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.

The pandemic period is viewed as "plastic hours"—crucial moments in history when an otherwise rigid social order becomes pliable, allowing for action and hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>. These moments require the right alignment of public opinion, political power, and events (usually a crisis), and depend on social mobilization and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:08">[01:17:08]</a>. The challenge is to seize these opportunities rather than letting them go unnoticed or wasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.

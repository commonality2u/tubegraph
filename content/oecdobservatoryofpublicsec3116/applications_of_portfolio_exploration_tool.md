The Portfolio Exploration Tool is a self-service digital instrument developed by the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) to help organizations understand and manage their innovation activities. It was created to allow organizations to conduct portfolio exploration workshops in a more distributed and self-service manner, especially relevant in the "coronavirus era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## Theoretical Background and Purpose

The tool is grounded in the OPSI's innovation facets model, which categorizes innovation based on its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>:
*   **[[missionoriented_portfolio_management | Mission-oriented innovation]]**: Focused on achieving specific, agreed-upon goals (e.g., climate change targets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, often top-down driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation**: Aims to improve current operations, making them more effective or efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This type has high certainty and works within existing systems driven by factors like austerity or increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation**: Responds to new ideas and evolving situations from within the system, fostering creativity and open space for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, and cannot be steered top-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation**: Addresses new risks, uncertainties, and future developments, preparing for fundamental shifts and changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, often involving high uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Organizations always possess an [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolio]], even if it's not formally acknowledged or stewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The tool helps organizations analyze their context and visualize their innovation portfolio to understand what types of innovation they support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.

## Key Features and Benefits

The Portfolio Exploration Tool provides:
*   Guidance on where to develop innovation capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   Recommendations for actions based on results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   Assistance in exploring changes over time and identifying areas for intervention and shifts in the [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   Individualized guidance tailored to specific organizational scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.
*   A [[managing_innovation_portfolios | portfolio management]] capability score, assessing factors important for [[managing_innovation_portfolios | managing innovation portfolios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
*   Project-based mapping, showing how individual projects align with the different innovation facets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This allows for "reverse engineering" conversations about how support structures can be shifted to achieve a different future portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   Anonymized aggregate data, providing a continuously updated global picture of innovation trends, which informs OPSI's future work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.

## Levels of Analysis

The tool supports various levels of analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>:
*   **Individual**: Users can understand their own individual portfolio or perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>.
*   **Team**: Helps teams make a case for deeper portfolio analysis, understand their fit within the organizational portfolio, and decide on their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.
*   **Senior/Central Managers**: Provides a snapshot for strategic planning, assessing alignment between current efforts and organizational ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.

## Real-World Applications

The tool has been beta-tested by "super users" in different organizations, helping to refine its design and assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>.

### Natural Resources Wales (NRW)

NRW is a public body in Wales, established in 2013, with sustainable development enshrined in its legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>. It has a broad remit, including advising government, regulating industry, managing natural resources, and responding to emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:35">[01:23:35]</a>.
Their interest in the tool stems from the significant challenges of the climate emergency and nature crisis, which require innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:07">[01:24:07]</a>, while also balancing statutory responsibilities like regulation and enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a>. As a young organization, they are still formalizing their approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a> and sought ready-made frameworks to make sense of their current activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>.

> [!note] NRW's Experience
> Using the tool helped NRW to crystallize discussions and provide a framework for internal conversations about innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a>. Initial observations showed they are "very strong in the enhancement space," which is typical for a public sector organization with highly specialized staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. However, they need to be "a little bit stronger in the anticipatory space" to address radical challenges like climate change and nature collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:17">[01:39:17]</a>.
>
> The tool highlighted areas where projects with a stronger "core of innovation" failed to progress due to bureaucratic processes like procurement and internal IT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:31">[01:56:31]</a>. It emphasized that "selling the idea" of innovation is a core competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:42">[01:56:42]</a>. NRW also noted the potential to use the tool within different divisions due to their varied remits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:11">[01:40:11]</a>. Their biggest challenge is scaling support for innovation from a small, dedicated multi-disciplinary team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>. They also face the challenge of getting everyone on the same page about what "innovation" actually means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>.

### City of Lund, Sweden

Lund is a university city in southern Sweden, known for significant innovations like Bluetooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:53">[02:59:53]</a>. The city has historically served as a testbed for early-stage innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:05">[03:00:05]</a>. With new research facilities being built, the city anticipates an "explosion" of innovation that will significantly impact it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:28">[03:28:28]</a>.

> [!note] Lund's Experience
> Lund's main challenge is creating awareness of how to effectively use innovation within the city, collaborating with external partners, and managing the inflow of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:10">[03:11:10]</a>. They need "portfolio thinking" to structure their approach, differentiate between what they do, what they do with others, and whether activities are happening randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:28">[03:28:28]</a>.
>
> The tool provided a structured way to talk about their innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:41">[03:32:41]</a>. They found that enhancement and anticipatory areas were often not considered "innovations" within their organization, meaning they lacked specific goals or resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:24">[03:42:24]</a>. The tool helped them visualize different areas and their needs, fostering a "negotiational area" between different innovation types and external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:37">[03:43:37]</a>. Lund emphasizes that [[managing_innovation_portfolios | portfolio management]] is less about process management and more about "people relational oriented system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:12">[03:07:12]</a>, requiring facilitators who can navigate and negotiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:09">[03:08:09]</a>. A key benefit was the ability to "nail it down" and create a clear starting point for discussions and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:48">[03:46:48]</a>. Success in [[managing_innovation_portfolios | managing innovation portfolios]] often involves a long-term, step-by-step approach and continuous storytelling of successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:01">[03:10:01]</a>.

## Concepts in Practice

### Portfolio Balance

"Portfolio balance" does not imply an equal distribution of projects or funding across all innovation types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:02">[03:44:02]</a>. Instead, it means intentionally aligning the innovation portfolio with the organization's strategic purpose and aims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:52">[03:52:52]</a>.

For a welfare organization, a portfolio might be heavily skewed towards adaptive innovation, responding to immediate needs, while a body like NASA would naturally have a portfolio dominated by anticipatory or [[missionoriented_portfolio_management | mission-oriented innovation]] focused on future technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:52">[03:52:52]</a>. The goal is to avoid "lock-ins" by ensuring the portfolio can support diverse types of innovation, even if unbalanced, to allow for different information and approaches to surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:52">[03:52:52]</a>.

The tool facilitates conversations about what the current balance is and whether it aligns with organizational goals, even if it reveals an "unbalanced" portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. It helps question if the organization is prepared for future shifts, even if current activities are strongly enhancement-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:17">[01:39:17]</a>.

### Synergies within Innovation Portfolios

The tool helps in identifying synergies between different innovation projects primarily by fostering discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. Many public sector organizations lack occasions to collectively review their innovation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:07">[01:49:07]</a>. The tool's visualization of projects in different zones helps organizations look at projects together and identify harmonies or discords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:51">[01:50:51]</a>.

This allows for questions like:
*   Do individual projects support the overall strategic goals, especially within [[missionoriented_portfolio_management | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:22">[01:51:22]</a>?
*   Are there projects, perhaps anticipatory ones, that are intentionally questioning the current mission or approach to prevent stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:24">[01:52:24]</a>?
*   Can projects in one facet (e.g., enhancement) be viewed through the lens of another (e.g., anticipatory) to enhance problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:11">[01:55:11]</a>?

The tool's structure, combining organizational context with project mapping, helps identify implicit biases in an organization's operating procedures (e.g., procurement, HR planning) that influence the types of innovations they are comfortable pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:03">[01:50:03]</a>.

### [[managing_innovation_portfolios | Portfolio Management]] Capability

[[managing_innovation_portfolios | Portfolio management]] can occur at various levels, from individual teams to entire cities or ministries, depending on where it makes the most strategic sense in relation to organizational goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>. For cross-cutting issues like climate change, units need to understand how their individual portfolios interact to achieve broader goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

Key aspects of [[managing_innovation_portfolios | portfolio management]] capability:
*   **Responsibility and Time**: Someone must be responsible for collecting and making sense of innovation information, periodically reviewing it to ensure the organization is moving in the right direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. This should be an ongoing activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.
*   **Evaluation**: The ability to [[evaluating_impact_of_innovation_portfolios | evaluate the performance of the portfolio as a whole]], rather than just individual innovations, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. A 100% success rate in innovations within a portfolio suggests an organization is not taking enough risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. The focus should be on whether the portfolio contributes to strategic goals or helps avoid undesirable futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.
*   **Communication and Partnerships**: Understanding how different teams and external partners' portfolios align with organizational aims, and where common ground exists, is vital for effective collaboration and incentivizing desired directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

The tool itself does not define what constitutes "innovation" for an organization, but it prompts a discussion around this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>. A common definition for innovation in this context is that it should be novel to the context, implemented, and have an impact in terms of shifts in public value or change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>.

## Getting Involved

The Portfolio Exploration Tool will be launched at the "Government After Shock" event in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.

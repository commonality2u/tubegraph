The co-creation boot camp brought together 100 individuals from the public sector, private sector, academia, and [[engagement_with_civil_society | civil society organizations]] to co-create solutions for civic participation challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. These challenges were presented by public sector teams from Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, who are committed to collaborating with society and leveraging emerging technologies to address them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The challenges specifically aimed at placing people at the center of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Technologies like AI, blockchain, and VR were utilized as tools to enhance [[democratic_innovations_and_citizen_engagement | democratic participation]] and foster more [[inclusive_and_accessible_democratic_participation | inclusive and accessible]] governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges through Design Sprint

To transform challenges into [[prototype_development_in_civic_innovation | prototype solutions]], participants followed a design sprint process structured by the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Step 1: Aligning on the Challenge
The initial step involved teams aligning on the specific challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This required:
*   Understanding the problem, its context, and any prior attempts to resolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   Identifying key stakeholders and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Recognizing potential barriers to implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   Defining desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

This alignment ensured a shared understanding and clear direction for all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Step 2: Ideation and Solution Sketching
With a clear grasp of the challenges, teams moved into ideation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This phase involved:
*   Quick brainstorming, discarding, and discussion of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Prioritizing ideas to effectively address the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Developing well-articulated solution sketches for the most popular ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   Creating quick drawings to give shape and form to solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Step 3: Prototyping
After sketching and discussing, teams refined their ideas to select one for [[prototype_development_in_civic_innovation | prototyping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Day two was entirely dedicated to developing this idea further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Teams focused on creating a minimal [[prototype_development_in_civic_innovation | prototype]] canvas based on their sketches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Approaches varied, with some using [[digital_and_virtual_engagement_for_effective_citizen_participation | digital tools]] and emerging technologies, while others opted for traditional materials like Legos and modeling clay to quickly create tangible representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Final Pitches and Future Development
Teams prepared final pitches to showcase their solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. They presented their work from the two-day boot camp in five minutes to other participants and a jury of experts from Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, and the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Ultimately, three solutions were selected for further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. These chosen [[prototype_development_in_civic_innovation | prototypes]] demonstrated significant advancements in [[citizen_participation_in_technology_governance | civic participation]] through the application of emerging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The ideas generated are expected to influence the future of [[citizen_participation_in_public_administration | civic participation]] across Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

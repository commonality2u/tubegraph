Anticipatory innovation involves engaging with the future, especially concerning highly uncertain areas where governments must consider technologies that are not yet a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach is crucial because once [[Innovation challenges and strategies | dominant designs]] emerge for an innovation, it becomes very difficult to change things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. For instance, the decision on which side of the road to drive cars established mobility systems that are now deeply ingrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Need for Anticipatory Innovation

Governments face new technological and non-technological choices that will evolve into innovations and [[Innovation challenges and strategies | dominant designs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. To effectively navigate these changes, governments need to be "ahead of the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. While it's not always possible to know for certain what will happen, it is essential to analyze and consider a variety of possible futures to influence emerging dominant designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Addressing Emerging Technologies

### Artificial Intelligence

[[AI in decision making | Artificial intelligence]] (AI) is highlighted as a major contemporary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Addressing [[Challenges of trusting AI over human judgment | AI]] requires both technological and ethical solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. [[Challenges and strategies in implementing innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] is necessary to foresee different types of solutions and to shape these innovations as they emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Key questions include establishing ethical boundaries for [[AI in decision making | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Blockchain

Similarly, there are questions regarding which blockchain solutions should be adopted, or if they should be adopted at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Proactive Influence

These questions related to [[AI in decision making | artificial intelligence]] and blockchain are currently open to influence, but this window of opportunity may close in ten or fifteen years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. When [[AI in decision making | artificial intelligence]] becomes widespread or a large portion of the population uses blockchain, altering their fundamental design or ethical frameworks will be significantly harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. To maintain a say in what is best for their people and countries, governments need to anticipate future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

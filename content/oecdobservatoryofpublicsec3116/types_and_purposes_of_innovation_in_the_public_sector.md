The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) developed a multifaceted [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] model to understand how to support [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] at the system level within governments and what different purposes [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] serves in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This model emerged from system-level studies of the Canadian and Brazilian governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

## OPSI's Multifaceted Innovation Model

The OPSI model identifies different facets or purposes of [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]]:

*   **Directed or Shaping Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>
    *   **Description**: This is "top-down" or mission-oriented [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]], exemplified by goals like putting a person on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Undirected or Responding Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>
    *   **Description**: This represents "bottom-up" [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] or [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] for [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation's]] sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. The outcome may be unknown, but the aim is to create space and an entrepreneurial spirit to find new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-Oriented Innovations (High Certainty)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>
    *   **Description**: This type of [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] focuses on taking existing processes and services and making them better or more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. An example includes using behavioral insights to increase the timely payment of taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
*   **Exploring/Radical Shifts (Uncertain Spaces)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>
    *   **Description**: This involves exploring and making radical shifts, examining how internal and external factors will change the fundamental nature of public sector work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## Methods and Innovation Outcomes

Each of these facets of [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] is supported by different methods, processes, disciplines, and domains of practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. The choice of methods can bias the innovative outcomes towards one of these facets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. For example, heavy investment in lean business process management, quality control, or behavioral insights may primarily result in enhancement-oriented [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. This highlights that investments in specific methods significantly impact [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

## Importance of Choosing Methods by Purpose

It is crucial for public sector innovators to choose methods according to their specific purpose, as this awareness is key to successful [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. This understanding of different [[types_of_innovation_within_public_sector_organizations | types of innovation]] and their supporting methods is integrated into tools like the OPSI Toolkit Navigator, which helps public sector innovators find the right resources based on their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

The green transition is considered one of the most significant challenges of our time, requiring more than just technological solutions and policies; it also necessitates a deep understanding of human behaviorâ€”how people live, work, and make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The OECD is committed to supporting governments in tackling [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate challenges]] more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### The Role of [[Behavioral science and climate change | Behavioral Science]]

Focusing on human behavior, the OECD's "Mind Shift Green Lift: Six [[Behavioral science and climate change | Behavioral Science]] Trends for Environmental Policy" report aims to help governments bridge the gap between ambitious goals and real-world impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. [[Behavioral science and climate change | Behavioral science]] provides valuable insights into encouraging necessary changes in individuals, businesses, and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>.

### Mitigation Efforts

Historically, [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] has primarily focused on [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation#Mitigation|climate mitigation]], which involves reducing emissions and promoting greener choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. Research suggests that shifting behaviors in key areas such as transport, food consumption, and energy use could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70% by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

[[Demand Side Policies in Climate Change | Demand side policies]] are increasingly recognized as essential for [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation#Mitigation|climate change mitigation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The OECD's "Net Zero Plus" project includes a key policy paper focusing on [[Demand Side Policies in Climate Change | demand side policies]] for [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation#Mitigation|climate change mitigation]] across sectors like energy use in buildings, transport, waste, and diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Tools such as green defaults, social influences, and choice architecture have proven effective in fostering sustainable behavior in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

#### Driving Demand for Sustainable Choices
Governments are increasingly using [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] to drive demand for sustainable goods, services, and technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. When more people adopt sustainable behaviors, such as switching to energy-efficient products or changing transport modes, it can create a ripple effect for broader change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. This includes:
*   Designing and testing labels to encourage sustainable consumer choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   Removing barriers to increase the use of green services like public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   Encouraging the adoption of green technologies, making them financially appealing and easier to adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.

These [[Demand Side Policies in Climate Change | demand side policies]] can unlock significant progress in the green transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

### Adaptation Efforts

[[Behavioral science and climate change | Behavioral science]] is also playing an increasingly significant role in [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation#Adaptation|climate adaptation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation#Adaptation|Adaptation]] involves adjusting behaviors to cope with both immediate and long-term effects of [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. This can mean encouraging behaviors to prevent wildfires or guiding actions during crises like floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Effective [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation#Adaptation|climate adaptation]] policies must be grounded in real human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

#### Example: Drought Assistance in Australia
During a severe drought in Eastern Australia from 2017 to 2019, the uptake of farmer assistance was low despite its availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. The Australian government's Behavioral Economics Team (Beta) identified barriers such as difficulty in concretely asking for help, overly complicated application processes, and the stigma associated with seeking assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. Information was also often not personalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Beta recommended reframing support using [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] to encourage farmers to seek assistance before a crisis point is reached and establishing trusted local points for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

### Interplay and Future Considerations

There is a growing concern about the potential for friction between [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation#Adaptation|climate adaptation]] and [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation#Mitigation|mitigation]] efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:12">[01:24:12]</a>. While [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation#Adaptation|adaptation]] may appear easier to gain support for due to its local, visible, and quicker effects, focusing too heavily on it could divert resources from more critical [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation#Mitigation|mitigation]] efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:50">[01:24:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. Some argue that this is like "mopping with the tap open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>.

The political context often finds [[climate_change_adaptation_and_mitigation#Adaptation|adaptation]] more acceptable, as even skeptics may agree that adjusting to a changing climate is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. However, it is crucial to maintain a clear hierarchy: first avoiding (mitigation) and then adapting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:55">[01:27:55]</a>. [[Behavioral science and climate change | Behavioral science]] should investigate the potential backfiring effects of promoting adaptation behaviors on mitigation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>.

### Strengthening Decision Making

Governments are encouraged to integrate [[behavioral_science_and_climate_change | behavioral science]] into their own decision-making processes for environmental policies to reduce biases and improve overall effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. This approach can help address challenges such as the existing trust gap between citizens and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The OECD's work on citizen participation and trust in government is relevant here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

#### Limitations
It's important not to place the entire burden of responsibility for [[climate_change_and_public_policy | climate change]] on individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. [[Behavioral science and climate change | Behavioral science]] is not a "silver bullet" but one piece of a broader strategy that must include technology and systemic changes for meaningful progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. A holistic approach is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. Furthermore, [[Demand Side Policies in Climate Change | demand side policies]] extend beyond individual choices to include governments and industries, recognizing the power of government procurement efforts to systematically shift demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. Achieving real impact demands cross-sectoral collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

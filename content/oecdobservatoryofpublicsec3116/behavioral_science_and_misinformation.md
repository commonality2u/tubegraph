Misinformation and disinformation are undoubtedly important topics that have fundamentally reshaped how information is consumed and shared, both online and offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The spread of inaccurate information has permeated all aspects of public life, including health (as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic), education, financial markets, and political affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This global challenge heavily depends on individual behaviors, as its spread ultimately relies on each person's choices in how they consume and share information within their networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

A failure to employ a behavioral lens poses a significant risk to the success of any solutions designed to tackle misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Engaging in knowledge and experience sharing is critical for the responsible and sustained use of [[behavioral_science_applications_in_combating_misinformation | Behavioral Science]] in policy design and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## International Collaboration

The OECD's [[behavioral_science_applications_in_combating_misinformation | Behavioral Insights Network]] has initiated a first-of-its-kind partnership between governments and international organizations, seeking to apply [[behavioral_science_applications_in_combating_misinformation | Behavioral Science]] to miss and disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This collaboration fosters inclusivity and diversity in framing pressing policy issues and responding to complex challenges at local, regional, or global levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Navigating the complex policy landscape becomes easier with diverse perspectives from several countries working towards a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This partnership, which involved the OECD, the Impact and Innovation Unit in the Canadian Privy Council Office, and the French [[behavioral_science_applications_in_combating_misinformation | Behavioral Insights]] Unit, aimed to develop and disseminate solutions to guide government responses to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

The collaboration allowed for real-time dialogue and offered a "Brain Trust" to navigate the misinformation space, connecting with a global network of academic experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. It enabled partners to share insights, understand existing gaps in evidence, and discuss practical implications for governments, policy, and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. Despite challenges like time zone differences, regular meetings allowed for data discussions and literature reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

### Research Objectives

The collaboration focused on three main objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>:
1.  **Understanding Complexity**: To better understand why people share misinformation on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
2.  **Evaluating Interventions**: To evaluate the impact of [[behavioral_science_applications_in_combating_misinformation | behavioral interventions]] on choices to share fake news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
3.  **Co-developing Best Practices**: To co-develop best practices to inform policy responses to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Why People Share Fake News

A key hypothesis, derived from a 2021 Nature publication, suggests that people share misinformation not only on purpose but also partially due to inattention to accuracy when engaging with news online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Often, individuals scroll and share content without critical thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

The study found a disconnect between sharing intentions and knowledge of what is true and false; some individuals may share fake news even when they do not believe it to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. While people were more likely to rate true news as accurate and had higher intentions to share true headlines compared to false news, the difference in sharing intentions was almost four times smaller than the difference in accuracy judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Targeted Interventions

To address this, two scalable interventions were tested to boost attention before people engage with news online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>:

1.  **Accuracy Evaluation**: Respondents were shown a random news headline and asked to rate its accuracy (e.g., "To the best of your knowledge, is this claim in the above headline accurate?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
2.  **Digital Media Literacy Tips**: Respondents saw a brief list of media literacy tips, such as "investigate the source," "look at other reports," and "watch for unusual formatting," before seeing both fake and true news headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

The study, led by the Canadian team as part of their longitudinal COSMO survey, included nearly 2,000 Canadians quarter-matched to the national distribution on age, gender, and geographic region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Fourteen headlines (seven true, seven false) were used, and outcomes measured included belief in the news and likelihood of sharing it on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

Both interventions were effective, but the **digital media literacy tips had the greatest impact**, reducing intentions to share fake news by 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This intervention specifically targeted information rated as most inaccurate, suggesting it effectively boosted people's attention to accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>. The effects were found to be similar across different population clusters, aligning with academic literature on interventions boosting attention to accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>.

## Who Spreads Misinformation

To understand individual differences in belief and sharing of misinformation, a cluster analysis was performed using data from the COSMO Canada survey. This analysis identified subgroups based on trust in information, information consumption, and cognitive factors like conspiracy mentality and openness to evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

Three clusters were identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>:

*   **Non-trusting (approx. 20% of sample)**: Low trust in all information sources, low openness to evidence, high conspiratorial thinking, and high psychological reactance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **High-trusting (in social media)**: High trust in all information sources, especially social media, low openness to evidence, medium-high conspiratorial thinking, and high psychological reactance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Institution-trusting**: High trust in institutional sources, low trust in social media, high openness to evidence, low conspiratorial thinking, and low psychological reactance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

As predicted, the **non-trusting** and **high-trusting** (in social media) clusters exhibited significantly greater belief and sharing of fake news compared to the **institution-trusting** cluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## [[policy_implications_for_tackling_misinformation | Policy Implications]]

The findings highlight three main policy messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>:

1.  **Don't Ignore the Human Factor**: A comprehensive policy response to dis- and misinformation must include an expanded understanding of human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. All government actions (legislative, regulatory, program, communications) have a human component, and understanding real-world human operation is key to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>.
2.  **Empower People**: The study did not attempt to regulate content but instead empowered users by changing their behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. These results offer effective and scalable solutions to complement holistic policy strategies and potentially offset the threat of fake news without direct content regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
3.  **Find What Works Across Borders**: Governments should conduct rigorous policy experiments in collaboration with other countries to generate sustainable responses to the spread of misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of [[international_collaboration_on_misinformation | International collaboration on misinformation]] given that "fake news knows no borders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

This research marks an important step along the journey of addressing misinformation, providing a data point that offers hope for stemming the tide of this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_communicating_behavioral_science_insights | Challenges and Opportunities]]

One of the [[challenges_in_addressing_misinformation_in_different_contexts | challenges in addressing misinformation in different contexts]] and applying findings broadly is the need for more follow-up research to understand the effectiveness of interventions across different types or subtypes of misinformation (e.g., scientific, political, cultural) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. While the current study focused on COVID-related misinformation, more varied testing is needed to generalize findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

The collaboration served as a practical example of [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_communicating_behavioral_science_insights | challenges and opportunities in communicating behavioral science insights]] and methods across different teams and contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. It demonstrated the value of combining rigorous research with the urgent needs of policy-making during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. The OECD facilitated an extremely easy and straightforward experience despite the complexities of cross-country and institutional collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

There is a significant opportunity to broaden the tools available to policy makers by adding less systemic, more easily operationalized interventions, such as "nudge-type" interventions like the media literacy tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>. This approach can complement more complex, longer-term changes like those in school curricula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. Such [[interventions_and_strategies_to_reduce_misinformation | interventions and strategies to reduce misinformation]] can help mitigate the [[the_impact_of_misinformation_on_public_health_behaviors | impact of misinformation on public health behaviors]] and other domains.

## Broader Context and Future Directions

Misinformation is often a symptom of a larger problem: the erosion of trust in Western democracies and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. This fragility in democracies, evident in various global events, requires collective work to address the core component of trust in government and its institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>.

The OECD's broader initiative on "building trust and reinforcing democracy" encompasses several key governance challenges, including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>:
*   Miss and disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.
*   Citizen participation and representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.
*   Government readiness to deal with global challenges and undue foreign influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>.
*   Democratic delivery on climate goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.
*   Digital democracy, encompassing misinformation and the transition of institutions from analog to digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>.

Addressing misinformation requires a "whole-of-government" and "whole-of-society" approach, involving various angles such as media literacy, regulatory transparency (not content regulation), and examining the [[the_role_of_social_media_platforms_in_spreading_misinformation | role of social media platforms in spreading misinformation]] and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. This study fits into the broader goal of building societal resilience to miss and disinformation by understanding *why* people engage with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.

Future work should continue this [[international_collaboration_on_misinformation | international collaboration on misinformation]], reaching out to more countries, applying current findings, and conducting further experiments to gather richer data from a [[behavioral_science_applications_in_combating_misinformation | Behavioral Science]] perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. This will help determine which mitigation strategies work best for whom and in what context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

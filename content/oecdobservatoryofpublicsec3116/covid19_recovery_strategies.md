The COVID-19 pandemic, alongside the preceding financial and sovereign crises, has significantly impacted public administration, leading to a weakening of its capacity in many countries and regions across Europe and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Despite this, the recovery period presents a critical opportunity to reshape and strengthen public services to address current and future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Key Challenges and Opportunities

Governments face a dual challenge: dealing with a generally weakened public administration while simultaneously addressing new challenges and leveraging new funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Opportunities for recovery include:
*   **New Funding and Support** Significant new funding is available to boost recovery, focusing on digital transformation, green initiatives, and a more cohesive approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Instruments like the Technical Support Instrument and Recovery and Resilience Plans at the European level offer possibilities to reshape the civil service and institutional capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Strengthening Public Administration** The quality of public administration is a precondition for convergence and growth, particularly for weaker regions to catch up and build a more resilient and sustainable path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from the Pandemic

The pandemic has accelerated existing trends and provided crucial insights for [[postpandemic_government_challenges_and_strategies | future government strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>:
*   **Whole-of-Government Approach** It is essential for governments to operate in a horizontal, whole-of-government manner, breaking down silos between programs, budgets, and organizational structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This requires appropriate skills and capabilities at the center of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **Vertical Optimization and Feedback Mechanisms** While historical focus has been on top-down compliance, there is a need to optimize vertically by creating feedback mechanisms that allow senior leadership to understand frontline issues directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. New capabilities, such as government-wide pulse surveys, can facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Policy Making and Implementation** Policymaking and implementation routines must adapt more quickly to fluid challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Annual review cycles are insufficient; more frequent convening and adjustments are needed based on the experiences of the workforce, managers, and the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Importance of the Workforce** The pandemic highlighted the critical role of the public sector workforce in a crisis and its importance for serving the public on a day-to-day basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. Leadership should prioritize supporting their workforce as their most important asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.

## Driving Innovation and Future-Oriented Governance

The crisis has led to an undeniable surge in [[innovative_responses_to_covid19_by_governments | innovation]], including increased digital government uptake, rapid reskilling of public servants, and collaboration with the third sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. To ensure future readiness, it is crucial to carry this [[innovation_strategies_during_covid19_recovery | innovative momentum]] forward and systematically build the capacity of the public service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

Key aspects for future-oriented governance include:
*   **Ambitious Missions** Designing and structuring ambitious missions to tackle global challenges like the climate crisis and achieve climate targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Foresight and Skills Development** Utilizing creative foresight exercises to envision and build the necessary skills and competencies for the public sector of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
*   **Cross-Border Collaboration** Pushing innovation beyond administrative boundaries and enhancing cross-border collaboration to address global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   **Inclusive Policy Design** Deliberately integrating inclusive policy design to build better policies for all and increase public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

## Addressing Inequality and Trust

The COVID-19 crisis has reinforced the need to better tackle inequalities, as crises disproportionately affect different groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>. Trust in government is becoming a major issue for democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

Strategies to promote equality and inclusion and strengthen democracy include:
*   **Systematic Inclusion of Diverse Perspectives** Countries need to integrate systematic approaches to gather diverse perspectives in decision-making, such as using "generation checks" to evaluate policy impacts across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.
*   **Inclusive Democratic Models** Shaping a more inclusive democratic model, including better participation and representation, can strengthen democracy and build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>.
*   **Targeted Support** Ensuring that vulnerable populations or those in remote areas are not left behind by digital transformation, which requires careful, detailed, and place-based approaches to avoid increasing regional and social divides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.
*   **International Cooperation and Exchange** Building a strong international cohort of leaders and facilitating the exchange of know-how and experiences across public administrations can enhance foresight and [[innovation_strategies_during_covid19_recovery | innovation capacities]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. This includes supporting member states in strengthening capacity for gender-sensitive and inclusive recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

## Moving Beyond Emergency Response

The challenge now is to transition from emergency management to a more robust, future-oriented strategy for long-term recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. Governments must invest in the foundations of their governing systems to drive innovation, harness new opportunities, and remain resilient and adaptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>. This means:
*   Acting at speed and scale when opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.
*   Prioritizing investment in innovation to foresee and respond to complex global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>.
*   Applying lessons learned from the pandemic to other pressing challenges, particularly the climate crisis and digital transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.

The [[the_economic_impact_of_the_pandemic_and_recovery_strategies | recovery provides an opportunity to transform government]] action, organization, and operations to avoid returning to the "old normal" and to shape a future with equal opportunities for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>.

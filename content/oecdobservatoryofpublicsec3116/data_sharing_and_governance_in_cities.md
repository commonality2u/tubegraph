Cities have emerged as critical actors in the post-COVID-19 era, with [[Role of Cities in Innovation | innovation]] playing a crucial role in building back better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The pandemic highlighted the importance of [[Role and management of data in digital public services | digitalization]] and the need for a renewed social contract between [[Role of Cities in Innovation | cities]] and urban residents concerning [[Trust and transparency in public governance | trust]] and [[Public participation and trust in urban governance | public participation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## The Critical Role of Data in Crisis Response

During the COVID-19 pandemic, [[Role of Cities in Innovation | cities]] were not only particularly affected but also on the front lines of the response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This involved coordinating to contain the virus spread, ensuring continuity of local public services (such as water, sanitation, and transport), and protecting vulnerable groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. [[Data governance for public sector innovation | Data]] played a vital role in these efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

For instance, London boroughs used [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data]] to identify newly vulnerable populations, such as those who had lost income or faced food insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This required understanding and modeling needs based on various indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The crisis also revealed how vital digital connectivity is, transforming education, telemedicine, e-commerce, and tele-work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This shift, driven by massive investment in [[Role and management of data in digital public services | digital]] infrastructure, allowed for "[[Role and management of data in digital public services | digital proximity]]" to substitute physical proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Challenges in Data Sharing and Governance

Despite the recognized importance of [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data]], significant challenges remain in [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data]] sharing and governance:

*   **Fragmented Systems** COVID-19 highlighted that issues like a pandemic do not respect administrative boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. In London, with 33 boroughs, a fragmented [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data]] picture prevented a coordinated response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. For example, identifying vulnerable children who received free school meals but attended school in a different borough was nearly impossible due to the need for 528 individual [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data]] sharing relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. This underscored the need for basic infrastructure to allow easy, secure, ethical, and legal access to [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
*   **Lack of Multi-level Coordination** In countries like the UK, national government initiatives often failed because they did not engage with [[Role of Cities in Innovation | city]] governments or co-design solutions with people on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. A national database of volunteers, for instance, was ineffective because it wasn't plugged into local needs, leading to wasted time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. This friction highlights the need for a partnership approach and two-way dialogue between national and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
*   **"Tyranny of the Averages"** When dealing with granular [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data]], relying solely on averages can mask severe inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. For example, Mexico City's average green space per inhabitant appeared adequate, but a deeper look revealed vast disparities, with wealthy neighborhoods having significantly more green space than vulnerable areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.
*   **Exclusion of Subjective Data** Traditional [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data]] often overlooks subjective realities like a city's intangible infrastructure or how residents relate to their urban environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. Public perceptions, influenced by cultural rather than purely rational factors, can profoundly impact [[Role of Cities in Innovation | city]] challenges, such as the view of cars as objects of desire despite traffic congestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

## Innovative Approaches to Data Management

[[Data governance for public sector innovation | Data governance for public sector innovation | Innovation]] in [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data]] management extends beyond technology to include structural, cultural, and political dimensions:

*   **Political Imagination and System Thinking** [[Role of Cities in Innovation | Cities]] can serve as agile laboratories for [[Role of Cities in Innovation | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. "Political imagination" involves defining the type of societies [[Role of Cities in Innovation | cities]] want to become and creating [[Public participation and trust in urban governance | participatory practices]] and [[Collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaboration]] to achieve that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. This holistic approach, like Mexico City's crowdsourced constitution, considers how human talent and potential can be activated for urban resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   **Open Knowledge Systems** The pandemic highlighted the benefits of open knowledge systems, as seen with international [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data]] sharing for vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>. Extending this to the [[Role of Cities in Innovation | city]] level involves thinking about urban commons and new typologies for civic spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.
*   **Balancing Objective and Subjective Data** While [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data-driven strategies]] are crucial, there's a need to incorporate subjective [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data]] and qualitative insights from residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>. This means complementing benchmarking with "freewheeling, creative, and open-ended exploratory cultural probes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>.
*   **Addressing Digital Inclusion** The increased reliance on [[Role and management of data in digital public services | digitalization]] has brought digital inclusion to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>. Lack of internet access or digital literacy can exclude individuals from education, work, and social connections, exacerbating mental health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. [[Role of Cities in Innovation | Cities]] are now focusing on providing devices, connectivity, and training to bridge this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

## Measuring Impact and Building Capacity

[[Role of Cities in Innovation | Innovation]] is increasingly seen as a "must-have" rather than a "nice-to-have" in [[Role of Cities in Innovation | city]] governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. The growth of chief [[Innovative approaches to public governance | innovation]] officers in [[Role of Cities in Innovation | cities]] (from 5 in 2012 to over 80 today in the US alone) demonstrates this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. However, it's crucial to link investment in [[Innovative approaches to public governance | innovation]] to tangible outcomes for residents' well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>.

[[Data governance for public sector innovation | Data]] is key to demonstrating this impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. [[Role of Cities in Innovation | Cities]] must define problems with [[Data governance for public sector innovation | data]], baseline current situations, and measure the impact of [[Innovative approaches to public governance | innovation]] efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>. This allows [[Role of Cities in Innovation | cities]] to prove the value of [[Innovative approaches to public governance | innovation]] and share successful strategies widely, fostering a cycle of learning and adoption among other municipalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The lessons from the pandemic emphasize that future planning in [[Role of Cities in Innovation | cities]] cannot rely on guessing what crises will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. Instead, it must focus on building resilience through flexible structures, developing competencies, and fostering a culture that embraces learning from mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>. This includes regarding [[Innovative approaches to public governance | innovation]] as a serious and professional core function, not an optional extra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.

The pandemic has accelerated positive changes, such as the re-evaluation of public institutions' importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. There is a renewed focus on optimizing for public value rather than just efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>. The shift in urban mobility, such as reclaiming streets for pedestrians and bikes, demonstrates how experiencing positive changes can lead to lasting policy shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. Ultimately, the goal is to integrate [[Innovative approaches to public governance | innovation]], [[Collaboration and innovation in public sector | collaboration]], and experimentation into the very fabric of society, ensuring that [[Role of Cities in Innovation | cities]] are prepared to activate resources and adapt quickly when future shocks occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>.

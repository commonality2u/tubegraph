[[innovation_portfolio_management_and_its_challenges | Innovation portfolio management]] is a topic gaining significant discussion, particularly within the public sector and among organizations seeking to address complex, systemic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This approach moves beyond traditional project-by-project thinking to a more holistic and strategic view of innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## The Need for Portfolio Approaches to Innovation

Historically, policy design and innovation projects in government have adopted a "layered approach," meaning new policies or projects are often added on top of existing ones without a systematic overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This layering makes it difficult to assess the collective impact of these efforts and ensure they align with desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The public sector needs to innovate to improve operations, capture emerging opportunities, solve problems, and adapt to evolving technological and societal landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Organizations often have an [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | innovation portfolio]] implicitly, whether they intentionally manage it or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This portfolio comprises various types of innovation, including:
*   **Mission-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
*   **Adaptive innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
*   **Anticipatory innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>

Managing these diverse types effectively and systemically is a key challenge, as each requires a different management approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Challenges in Current Innovation Portfolio Management

Current approaches to [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | innovation portfolio management]] often focus primarily on initial sense-making and [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | stewardship]] of projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. However, they give less attention to the organizational and institutional structures needed to support these diverse innovations on an ongoing basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Projects are frequently layered without being analyzed for their common outcomes or synergies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Specific challenges include:
*   **Siloed Thinking:** Large organizations frequently struggle with silos, hindering effective collaboration across departments or teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:59">[01:14:59]</a>.
*   **Vested Interests and Power Structures:** When driving systems change, organizations must contend with actors and institutions that have power and vested interests in maintaining the current system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>.
*   **Funding Mechanisms and Bias:** Traditional funding mechanisms can limit the scope of innovation, leading to a bias towards certain types of projects or outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>. Agencies, acting as funders, might inadvertently create a bias towards certain tools or approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.
*   **Complexity and Uncertainty:** Addressing "wicked problems" like climate change requires navigating high levels of uncertainty, where all information is never available to make perfect decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>. Traditional management approaches may not accommodate constant change, multiple stakeholders, and varying scales and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **Project-Centric vs. Portfolio-Centric View:** A good individual project is not sufficient if it doesn't fit within the broader portfolio strategy and contribute to collective goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>.

## Strategies for Effective Innovation Portfolio Management

Effective [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | innovation portfolio management]] requires a shift in approach, moving beyond traditional strategic portfolio management that focuses on executing defined strategies through programs and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. Instead, it emphasizes fostering transformation through collaboration and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>.

### Core Components and Approaches

The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) identifies several components of effective portfolio management:
*   **Sense-making:** Understanding what is being learned from innovation activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
*   **Stewarding:** Guiding and overseeing the projects within the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Supportive Structures:** Establishing institutions and organizational structures that enable continuous innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Defining Purposes:** Clearly articulating why innovation is being pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Finding Synergies:** Identifying how different projects can complement each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Resourcing:** Allocating resources effectively across the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Monitoring and Evaluating:** Tracking progress and assessing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Learning and Communication:** Fostering continuous learning and clear communication about innovation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Key Strategies from Practitioners

1.  **Demand-Driven and Problem-Focused Innovation:** Shifting from supply-driven innovation (e.g., technology push) to demand-driven approaches that understand actual market challenges and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>. This involves working closely with "challenge owners" to define problems, acknowledging that different stakeholders bring their own biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>.
2.  **Systems-Level Intervention:** Applying innovation in systems and adopting a systems intervention perspective to drive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. This means identifying "objects" like streets, schools, or farms that act as complex systems, allowing a portfolio of diverse actors and interventions to collide and work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>.
3.  **Co-Design and Participative Approaches:** Engaging a broad range of stakeholders, including citizens, experts, and organizations from different sectors (public, private, associations) in the design process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. This fosters a "coalition of the willing" and ensures insights are grounded in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:06">[02:26:06]</a>.
4.  **Collective Intelligence in Decision-Making:** Moving away from decisions made by a small group of senior management or experts to a consensus model that brings together diverse colleagues with different perspectives and areas of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. This helps mitigate inherent biases and broadens thinking in complex situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.
5.  **Focus on Learning and Adaptation:** Viewing projects as experimental means of learning about and tackling problems, rather than merely execution vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>. This requires creating spaces for constant learning and adapting processes, organizations, and networks based on new insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>.
6.  **Addressing Organizational Change:** Recognizing that implementing a portfolio approach often requires significant organizational change, including shifts in behavior and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>. It's a continuous process of "organizing" rather than a static "organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.
7.  **Leadership for Transformation:** Shifting from an expert, role-based, static leadership to a systems leadership that enables collaboration and empowers diverse individuals to take the lead on different issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. This type of leadership embraces uncertainty and discomfort, understanding that they do not always have the "right answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>.
8.  **Strategic Use of Funding:** Detaching initial problem framing from direct funding discussions can lower participants' guard and encourage more open, collaborative problem-solving, as other resources or existing funding streams might be more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>.

## Innovation Portfolio Assessment Tools

The OECD OPSI is developing an [[innovation_portfolio_management_in_public_sector | innovation portfolio assessment tool]] for public sector organizations, designed to help them understand and manage their innovation efforts more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>.

The tool will have three modules:
1.  **Experience-Based Module:** Generates "heat maps" showing how organizational culture, rules, procurement procedures, leadership, and incentives shape and potentially bias [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | innovation portfolios]] across different types of innovation (mission, enhancement, adaptive, anticipatory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>.
2.  **Project-Based Assessment Module:** Analyzes how different innovation projects fit together and serve various purposes, looking at project-specific outputs and their combined effects towards common goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a>.
3.  **Organizational Analysis Module:** Provides a comprehensive picture of how individuals perceive and interact with the [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | innovation portfolio]] based on their roles, analyzing the organization's influence on innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

These tools aim to provide a quick snapshot of an organization's innovation portfolio, acting as a conversation starter about resource allocation and value within the broader innovation context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>. The development of such tools is part of a broader effort to build the field of [[innovation_portfolios_and_management | innovation portfolio management]] and guide public sector organizations towards more systemic and effective innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.

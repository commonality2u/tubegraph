Sludge audits are a critical tool for identifying and reducing "unnecessary frictions" in government services, which block access, impose psychological costs, and erode public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. The term "sludge," coined by Professor Cass Sunstein, refers to unjustified barriers that make it harder to access and use public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:03">[01:13:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>. Sludge in government services is often unintentional, stemming from issues like hard-to-find information, complex processes, long waiting times, or difficult decision points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:14">[01:41:14]</a>.

## The OECD and New South Wales Partnership
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), particularly its Behavioral Science team, has partnered with the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Customer Service in Australia to develop and disseminate methodologies for [[sludge_audits_and_their_impact_on_government_services | sludge audits and their impact on government services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. This collaboration aims to make governments more effective and equitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Origins of the NSW Sludge Audit Method
Inspired by Professor Cass Sunstein's work, the NSW Sludge Audit Method was developed in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:40">[01:46:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:57">[01:54:57]</a>. It leverages Behavioral Science to identify and quantify the psychological aspects of administrative burden, which traditional methods often miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:48">[01:16:48]</a>.

The method focuses on:
*   **Integrating Behavioral Science:** Systematically applying behavioral evidence to service improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>.
*   **Quantification:** Isolating and quantifying different aspects of sludge, especially psychological costs and equity impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.
*   **Prioritization and Measurement:** Providing data-driven prioritization of fixes and ways to measure impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>.

### Psychological Costs of Sludge
A key aspect of sludge audits is understanding and attempting to quantify psychological costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. These include:
*   **Search Costs:** The burden of finding hard-to-locate information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>.
*   **Decision Costs:** Psychological burden from evaluating complex or similar options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Costs:** Mental resources expended to understand complex information or fulfill requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a>.
*   **Emotional Costs:** Stress, disempowerment, anxiety, frustration, and feelings of stigma or loss of autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

These costs disproportionately affect vulnerable people, including specific vulnerable groups or individuals experiencing life changes (e.g., giving birth, natural disasters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>.

### New South Wales Sludge Audit Method Steps and Metrics
The NSW method has seven steps and focuses on four key metrics:
*   **Time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>
*   **Cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>
*   **Effort** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>
*   **Inclusion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>

The "effort" and "inclusion" components are particularly unique, codifying Behavioral Science evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. The method has been tested on nearly 100 audits, significantly impacting services in NSW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. A "Sludge Finder web tool" and other resources are available as part of the toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## The First International Sludge Academy
The first [[international_collaboration_on_sludge_reduction | International Sludge Academy]] piloted the NSW methodology outside of Australia, engaging 16 teams from 14 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. The initiative included masterclasses on the NSW method and one-on-one mentorship from NSW colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. Countries audited a diverse range of processes, including citizen-facing public services and internal government processes like HR services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

### Nine Good Practice Principles for Sludge Prevention
Learnings from the International Sludge Academy led to the identification of nine principles to support governments in conducting [[sludge_audits_and_their_impact_on_government_services | sludge audits and their impact on government services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>:
*   **Deciding to do a Sludge Audit:** Consider the level of control over changing the process and the potential for a business case for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Having a Method:** Utilizing a predefined, common methodology ensures rigor, replicability, and comparability across different contexts and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Tailoring the Audit to Context:** Accommodating complicated, non-linear behavioral journeys and deploying an equity lens throughout the process, even focusing audits on underserved communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Evaluating Progress:** Translating audits into on-the-ground changes, making use of behavioral frameworks, and committing to re-auditing to measure impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **System Enablers:** Identifying necessary enablers for a successful sludge prevention program, such as government commitment to improving user services, close connection to service owners, and systematic customer survey data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

## Case Studies from the International Sludge Academy

### France: Simplifying Aid for Independent Living
The French Behavioral Insights team applied the sludge audit method to the "Assistance for Independent Living (APA)" process, a form for elderly people to receive aid to stay at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. The administration reported breakouts and abandonment at various stages due to complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

Key actions included:
*   **Extensive Interviews:** Speaking with 20 individuals across nine departments, including caregivers, applicants, departmental councils, and support professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Form Review and Step-by-Step Analysis:** Reviewing existing forms and going through each step with applicants to understand time, effort, and emotional costs (e.g., frustration, abandonment points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

The audit prioritized the most problematic areas, revealing that issues extended beyond just language simplification to include processes creating inequality or complex steps for specific users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

Takeaways from the French experience:
*   **User-Centricity:** Allowed the administration to adopt the user's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Objective Analysis:** Provided objective identification of complexities and areas for time-saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Multi-Dimensional Insights:** Included insights on psychological costs and inclusion issues, approaching the process from various angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Autonomous Diagnosis:** Showcased that administrations could independently conduct and replicate audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

Challenges encountered included a lack of objective data, requiring significant time to gather, and internal discussions about dedicating a full-time position for sludge audits versus training administrations, and the ideal disciplinary background for such a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

### Brazil: Streamlining Gob.br Account Recovery
Brazil focused on the recovery process for the Gob.br account, which serves as the main entry point for over 4,000 digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. While the automated recovery process (using digital and facial recognition) is well-designed for some, a significant vulnerable population (millions of users) must navigate a more costly and difficult online form process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

Brazil is now developing its own sludge audit tool, adapting the methodology for Portuguese and emphasizing a systematic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. This new tool incorporates an "equity check" to recognize and guide different user journeys, especially for vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. The goal is to create a self-applied tool, with homepage templates, guides, and tutorials, to be scaled up and used by federal, state, and local governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

Lessons learned from Brazil:
*   **Entry Point for Behavioral Insights:** Sludge audits serve as an effective entry point for Behavioral Insights in government, being easy to communicate and show results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Self-Awareness:** The sludge audit tool itself should be designed to avoid creating new "sludge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Communication:** There is a need for better labeling and more positive framing for "sludge audits" in certain cultural contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Inclusiveness and Equity:** Sludge reduction is crucial for promoting inclusiveness, equity, and improving public perception of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

## Future Directions for Sludge Audits
The success of the first International Sludge Academy has paved the way for a potential second academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. Future plans include:
*   **Tailored Support:** Recognizing that different teams have varying needs, from independent auditing to needing mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Methodological Development:** Continuing to refine and develop the sludge audit method itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Broader Audience:** Opening participation to program, policy, and service delivery teams beyond just Behavioral Science units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Peer Learning:** Emphasizing knowledge sharing and advancement of methodology within a growing community of practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **OECD's Role:** Continued involvement in publications, research, inviting experts (e.g., from customer experience and data science), and benchmarking common government processes (like passport renewal) across countries to identify and compare sludge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

The OECD is also developing an international standard, the "OECD Recommendation on Human-Centered Public Administrative Services," currently open for public consultation, which aims to set a clear policy framework for people-centered service design and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

Ultimately, [[innovation_tools_and_methods | sludge audits]] are viewed as a vital addition to the toolkit for improving public services, not just for administrative efficiency but for reshaping services to be more equitable, accessible, and trusted, particularly for vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. The goal is to give people more "time" by reducing unnecessary burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>. Measurement is just the first step; action in response to audits is what truly creates better services, better government, and a better world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the need for international cooperation, but also revealed existing challenges, including the role of technology and the digital divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. While the crisis has drawn attention to national responses, it has made working together more crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Challenges of the Digital Divide
The [[importance_of_digital_literacy | digital divide]] has emerged as a significant barrier to optimal international cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

### Data Interoperability
A major problem in regulatory cooperation is that different countries gather data in different ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>. The challenge lies in creating interoperability between data and [[role_of_digital_tools_in_government | digital technology]] so that all can rely on a common set of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. This [[importance_of_digital_literacy | digital divide]] applies to any form of international cooperation and should be a high priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. For instance, while there is discussion about using blockchain to monitor supply chains, a risk arises if different technologies are used, hindering cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

### Capacity Issues
Some offices lack the capacity for digital advancements, including access to scientists or experts in machine learning and AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

## Role of Digital Tools in Cooperation
Despite the challenges, the crisis has accelerated the use of [[role_of_digital_tools_in_government | digital tools]] and fostered new forms of cooperation.

### Virtual Globalization
The crisis has led to a kind of [[digital_advancements_and_accessibility_challenges_in_public_innovation | virtual globalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Conferences, like the one discussed, are excellent examples of this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Adapting Multilateral Systems
Governments working in an internationalized system have rapidly and successfully adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), for example, has continued to function effectively during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. They have engaged in significant informal discussion and information sharing, utilizing "hybrid discussions" to accommodate delegates who cannot travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. There is a willingness to adapt meeting formats to diverse time zones and allow for flexible collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

However, challenges remain, particularly in maintaining the normative agenda in multilateral forums when personal contact and face-to-face interactions are limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Running multilateral business on virtual platforms like Zoom can impede understanding of body language and the overall sense of the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

### IP Global AI Network (IP-GAIN)
IP Australia is developing a proof-of-concept called the IP Global AI Network (IP-GAIN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. This platform aims to foster international collaboration and co-development of practices and technology around machine learning in patent offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

Its goals include:
*   Developing novel approaches to technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.
*   Reducing duplication of efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>.
*   Creating a secure way to openly share artificial intelligence tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.

The initiative aims to overcome [[importance_of_digital_literacy | digital divide]] issues by allowing less-resourced offices to access tools and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. Functioning like an app store or marketplace, it includes a platform, access to AI tools via browser and APIs, and a code repository for sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. While viability depends on uptake and overcoming differences in security standards, it has the potential to streamline international IP processes by sharing tools and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a [[digital_advancements_and_accessibility_challenges_in_public_innovation | digital transformation]] and international cooperation on research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. Governments are increasingly dependent on non-state actors for data and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. Moving forward, the focus should be on how NGOs, businesses, civil society, and various sectors can collaborate through the application of technology across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

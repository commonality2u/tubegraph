Historically, research in public sector innovation has primarily focused on government capacity to innovate within its established territories and jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, as problems evolve from complicated to complex, and from local to global, governments increasingly need to collaborate and find new solutions for shared issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Major challenges like COVID-19, climate change, digitalization, and migration are not limited by jurisdictional borders and demand [[government collaboration across borders | collective action]] across countries and policy fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Challenges to Cross-Border Collaboration and Skill Development

Despite the recognized need for [[collaboration and innovation in public sector | government innovation]], efforts are largely confined to national or local borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Several factors contribute to this:

*   **Lack of Preparedness** The COVID-19 crisis exposed a lack of preparedness among governments to tackle global challenges, with only half of OECD countries having dedicated institutions to identify novel or complex crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. It also highlighted weaknesses in international cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Perceived Lack of Permission** Government agency personnel often feel they lack the "permission" to look across borders or invest time in [[crossborder collaboration in public services | cross-border collaboration]], viewing it as outside their key performance indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. This "tribal" mentality often leads public servants to believe their work is the most important, making it difficult to advocate for cross-border or cross-sectoral work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Language Differences** Understanding the culture and language of the "other" is a significant issue in any form of cross-border cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. Even within a single country, cultural differences between states can pose challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. Geographic proximity often correlates with cultural proximity, making collaboration with distant countries more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   **Funding Metrics** Existing funding metrics can be a barrier, as treasuries may "net off" benefits generated on the other side of a border, discouraging co-investment for more efficient outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.
*   **Societal Polarization** Instruments of globalization, such as social media, can paradoxically drive societies apart by polarizing public discourse, making [[crossborder collaboration in public sector innovation | cross-border initiatives]] less understood or valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Media trends, with fewer foreign correspondents, also contribute to a narrower public conversation about cross-border issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Change** There is an inherent ease in maintaining existing practices, and embarking on cross-border collaboration introduces transaction costs, requiring a readiness to change how things are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

## Essential Skills and Success Factors for Collaboration

To overcome these challenges and foster [[crossborder collaboration in public sector innovation | cross-border innovation]], several key factors and skills are vital:

*   **Building Trust and Relationships** This is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. It's often not about mistrust, but about people not knowing their counterparts. Investing in ongoing relationships, even when there isn't an acute issue, makes future collaboration easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. This applies to personal interactions, which are crucial for any implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>.
*   **Common Goals and Shared Vision** Just as in "Alice in Wonderland," having a defined common problem or area for collaboration is necessary to achieve results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. Political support and agreeing on a common mission, strategy, and structures are key success factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Engagement and Formalization** While relationships are vital, formal structures can significantly ease collaboration. The Kvaraken Council, a Nordic cross-border entity, found that forming a European Group for Territorial Cooperation (EGTC) made it easier to be a formalized partner and secure financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. Leveraging common platforms like the EU can also streamline processes and secure funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.
*   **[[Learning and capacity building in government | Learning and Capacity Building]]** Public servants need to be enabled to develop and run cross-border cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. This includes:
    *   **Direct Engagement:** Bringing public servants to the border to sit with and learn from communities who live and work in the cross-border area. This provides a safe place to practice problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>.
    *   **Developing Skills:** Cross-border work is not an innate skill; it must be learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. Governments need to allow and invest in people gaining international and cross-border skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.
    *   **Understanding Diverse Actors:** Effective collaboration requires dialogue with a diverse set of actors beyond traditional international organizations and governments, including companies, NGOs, civil society, and academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.
    *   **Readiness to Change:** Individuals and institutions must be willing to learn new ways of doing things by looking elsewhere and doing with others, making the process less burdensome over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.
*   **Conducive Regulatory Frameworks and Finance** Innovation thrives with appropriate regulation and accessible finance. Public banks, like the European Investment Bank (EIB), can play a crucial role in crowding in private money by providing safe investment signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing Uncertainty** Rather than turning inward, facing uncertainty demands [[building resilient and adaptive government systems | cross-border collaboration]] to leverage diverse perspectives, share risks, and pool resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. Governments should learn to live with uncertainty and not underestimate the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>.

### Practical Examples of Cross-Border Collaboration
*   The [[cocreation and international collaboration | Kvaraken Council]], a Nordic cross-border entity, leverages cross-sector collaborative methods for future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. It has fostered over 100 projects, including an environmentally friendly ferry between Sweden and Finland, and contributed to the Nordic Battery Belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.
*   The Open European Dialogue is a network of parliamentarians from different countries and parties who collaborate through experimental dialogue methods to foster shared learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   The Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal in northern England and southern Scotland secured substantial co-funding for a unified approach to inclusive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Moving Forward

To further embed [[collaboration and public sector partnerships | cross-border collaboration]] in government operations, it is crucial to secure leadership and collective vision, put in place the right enablers such as co-funding and co-governance, and share costs and benefits equitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. Public servants should be encouraged to consistently ask "the border question" in their work to identify opportunities for cross-border gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. This also involves listening to understand and learn, opening doors for future collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>.

This article provides an introduction to [[public_sector_innovation|public sector innovation]], how OPSI (Observatory of Public Sector Innovation) views it, and the importance of problem framing. It also highlights several key challenges faced when attempting to innovate within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## What is [[Innovation in Public Sector|Public Sector Innovation]]?

While there isn't a single, universally accepted definition for innovation, especially within the public sector, it is often recognized by context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. What is considered innovative in one country or organization may not be in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

However, three common factors define innovation:
*   **Novelty**: Introducing new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   **Implementation**: Creative ideas must be put into practice; it's a critical part of the lifecycle but not the only part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Impact**: The implementation must have a measurable effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

## Why is [[Innovation in Public Sector|Innovation in the Public Sector]] Needed?

[[Public sector innovation|Public sector innovation]] is crucial for several reasons:
*   **Changing Functions**: The world is constantly changing, leading to new expectations for government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
*   **Closing the Service Gap**: There is generally a gap between the services offered by the private sector and those provided by the public sector. [[public_sector_innovation|Public sector innovation]] aims to close this gap by rethinking service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.
*   **No Room for Spectators**: Innovation capacity must be widespread, not limited to specialized labs or individuals. Everyone needs to be engaged in some way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.
*   **Citizen and Political Demands**: Citizens and politicians increasingly want more from government, necessitating a response to avoid a mismatch in desired and delivered services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   **Core Competency**: Innovation needs to be embedded as a core competency across government to better respond to future crises and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

## [[Public sector innovation challenges|Challenges in Public Sector Innovation]]

The public sector faces numerous [[public_sector_innovation_challenges|challenges]] when attempting to innovate:

### Perception of Innovation
*   **Out of Reach**: Grand achievements in innovation often make it seem unattainable for the ordinary person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. The focus should be on the building blocks and behind-the-scenes work that makes innovation accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Specific Definition**: There isn't a universally agreed-upon definition of innovation, leading to varied interpretations and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

### Implementation and Impact Measurement
*   **Measuring Impact**: It is challenging to measure the impact of innovation, especially when truly new things are being done, and the right metrics may not be immediately clear or observable for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.
*   **Diffusion of Lessons**: The public sector traditionally struggles with diffusing best practices and lessons learned, especially from failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.

### Problem Framing and Solution Focus
*   **Push for Quick Responses**: Government often prioritizes quick responses over finding the *right* response, potentially solving symptoms rather than root problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>.
*   **Jumping to Conclusions/Solutions**: There's a tendency to jump immediately into solution mode after only a brief examination of a problem, rather than deeply understanding the problem space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:00">[33:34:00]</a>.
*   **Undefined Problems**: Public servants often start a project with the problem already defined for them, or even a solution already decided, bypassing crucial problem-framing stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:00">[27:34:00]</a>.
*   **Complex Problems**: As new information emerges, problems can become large, complex, and unwieldy, potentially intimidating individuals or moving beyond their scope of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>.
*   **Evolving Problems**: Problems are not static; they can change or be completely new, requiring continuous re-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:40:00">[30:40:00]</a>.
*   **Assumptions as Facts**: A major [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation_in_the_public_sector|challenge]] is separating factual information from assumptions, as anecdotal information is often treated as definitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:00">[32:57:00]</a>.

### Organizational Culture and Leadership
*   **Conservative and Risk-Averse Culture**: Most public sectors are inherently conservative and risk-averse, often due to political, media, or financial (taxpayer funds) concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:25:00">[46:25:00]</a>. This discourages experimentation and can lead to frustration for "insurgents" who question the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Planning vs. Iteration**: The traditional government model of five-year plans, extensive study, and analysis-to-death before implementation creates tension with iterative, experimental, and prototyping approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:31:00">[48:31:00]</a>.
*   **Leadership Gaps**: Leaders may talk about innovation but not enact underlying changes, or they may focus on a few isolated "innovative projects" rather than embedding innovation throughout the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:43:00">[43:43:00]</a>.

## Addressing [[Challenges and strategies in implementing public sector innovation|Challenges and Strategies in Implementing Public Sector Innovation]]

### The Innovation Lifecycle
OPSI has developed a six-step [[types_of_public_sector_innovation|innovation]] lifecycle, which is not strictly linear and allows for movement back and forth between stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>:
1.  **Identifying Problems**: Ensuring the right problem is being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>.
2.  **Generating Ideas**: Inclusive and collaborative approaches to developing new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.
3.  **Developing Proposals**: Filtering ideas into those to be further explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>.
4.  **Implementing**: Putting ideas into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.
5.  **Evaluating**: Assessing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>.
6.  **Diffusing**: Sharing best practices and lessons learned (including failures) across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.

### Problem Framing
A key strategy to overcome [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation_in_the_public_sector|challenges]] is effective problem framing, which involves exploring and understanding the problem before seeking solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:00">[26:59:00]</a>.

The **Double Diamond** design methodology illustrates this: the first diamond focuses on framing the problem (Discover, Define), and the second on defining and finding the solution (Develop, Deliver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a>.

Steps to better frame a problem:
1.  **Start with New Information**: Use new data or insights as a trigger to ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:04:00">[31:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Ask Key Questions**: Explore what is known, what is possible, what is expected, and what is truly needed to arrive at the actual problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Iterative Process**: Problem framing is cyclical, with constant new information and feedback requiring continuous re-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>.

#### Practical Tips for Problem Framing
*   **Clarifying Intent**: Clearly define what is actually trying to be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>.
*   **Making Assumptions Explicit**: Separate facts from assumptions to challenge and verify them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Jumping to Conclusions**: Resist the urge to immediately seek solutions after a brief problem review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.
*   **Connecting with Others**: Be inclusive and collaborative, bringing in diverse experiences and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>.
*   **Reframing the Problem**: Look at the problem from different angles to facilitate various solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:35:00">[34:35:00]</a>.
*   **Experimentation in Problem Space**: Experiment not to find solutions, but to better understand the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[36:37:00]</a>.

#### The Five Whys
A simple exercise for problem framing is the **Five Whys** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:46:00">[39:46:00]</a>. By defining the problem and then repeatedly asking "why" it's happening, one can uncover deeper root causes and gain a more complete understanding of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:00">[40:01:00]</a>.

### Essential Skills for Innovation
To foster innovation and overcome [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation_in_the_public_sector|challenges]], public servants need to develop additional skill areas beyond their core competencies:
*   **Iteration**: Doing things quickly, cheaply, and with reduced risk to get faster feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.
*   **Data Literacy**: Understanding how to use data for insights and impact measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.
*   **User Centricity**: Putting the end user at the center of design, changing the focus from internal efficiency to citizen impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.
*   **Curiosity**: The ability to ask questions, look for new ways of doing things, and engage in horizon scanning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.
*   **Storytelling**: Crafting compelling, concise, and memorable stories that resonate with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>.
*   **Insurgency**: Questioning the status quo and trying new approaches, often from those who identify existing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

It's not enough to have these skills; there must also be the **opportunity** to practice them and the **motivation** (incentive) to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Overcoming [[public_sector_innovation_challenges|challenges]] in [[innovation_in_public_sector|public sector innovation]] requires continuous effort, resilience, and a shift in mindset. By focusing on understanding problems deeply, fostering key innovation skills, and encouraging experimentation, public servants can drive meaningful change despite conservative cultures and inherent risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:53:00">[46:53:00]</a>.

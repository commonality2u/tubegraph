In an increasingly interconnected world, problems have evolved from complicated to complex, and from local to global, necessitating governments to unite and devise novel solutions to shared issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While innovation has surged, particularly demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis, existing vulnerabilities and a lack of preparedness among governments to tackle global challenges have been exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Only half of OECD countries possess dedicated institutions for identifying unforeseen or complex crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Major challenges such as COVID-19, climate change, digitalization, and migration transcend jurisdictional borders, demanding collective action across countries and policy fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Demonstrating a collective ability to address these global challenges is essential to reinforce democracy and public trust in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Navigating Uncertainty in Cross-Border Innovation

The core question arises: How can uncertainty, which characterizes cross-border issues, be factored into and managed within global collaborations? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>

### Embracing Uncertainty as a Constant
Life, in essence, is a constant exercise in [[international_collaboration_in_crisis_management | crisis management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. A fundamental approach to uncertainty is to learn to live with it, recognizing that the world does not operate as a utopia where things always run smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>. Humans tend to over-rationalize the past, over-dramatize the present, and underestimate the future; avoiding these tendencies is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

### The Role of Cross-Border Collaboration in Crisis
The COVID-19 pandemic serves as a prime example of how uncertainty is managed through [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>. Various cross-border actors, including states, regions, [[international_collaborations_to_combat_misinformation | international organizations]] (like WHO, UN, EU, OECD), [[privatepublic_partnerships_in_addressing_global_challenges | big pharma]], scientists, the transport sector, value chains, procurement entities, trade, finance, and NGOs, have all been involved in addressing the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a>.

In uncertain situations, the inclination to "close shop and turn inward" is a natural, yet counterproductive, political response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>. Instead, to find solutions to uncertainty, governments must actively engage in [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>.

### Benefits of Collaboration
This collaborative approach ensures:
*   A multitude of options are explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>.
*   Extensive learning from diverse experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>.
*   Shared risk among partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.
*   Pooling of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>.

Ultimately, effective states, democratic processes, and robust institutions contribute to better outcomes, even amidst uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the profound interconnectedness of countries, reinforcing the necessity of deep [[cocreation_and_international_collaboration | cooperation]] and the exchange of best practices to create optimal conditions for growth and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>.

Public servants encounter a variety of [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]], problems, and situations, none of which are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Nature of Challenges
These [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]] can vary greatly, with no two situations being the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Navigating Innovation Tools
While numerous innovation tools, toolkits, guides, and playbooks exist, a significant [[challenges_in_public_sector_innovation | challenge]] for public servants is knowing where or how to begin utilizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. There is no shortage of tools, but rather a need for a better filter or compass to guide them to the appropriate resources for their innovation journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### OPSI Toolkit Navigator
To address this [[challenges_in_implementing_innovation_in_the_public_sector | challenge]], the OPSI Toolkit Navigator was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. It connects specific situations, problems, or [[challenges_and_strategies_for_innovative_public_services | challenges]] faced by public servants to relevant toolkits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This resource, developed with the input of hundreds of public servants and leaders, helps filter out clutter to provide a clearer path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The development process involved:
1.  Analyzing and organizing hundreds of existing toolkits based on the actions they inform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  Exploring the common situations, problems, and [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]] public servants encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
3.  Understanding how public servants typically conceptualize their situations or problems and what they aim to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
4.  Designing navigational paths to suggest tools based on desired actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Beyond just finding the right tool, the OPSI Toolkit Navigator also provides connections to:
*   Skills and capacity building resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
*   Real-life case studies of innovation in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   Fellow public servants and experts who have faced similar [[challenges_and_solutions_in_public_service_delivery | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>

[[empowering_public_servants | Public servants]] routinely encounter diverse [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]], problems, or situations, with no two being identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]] can range widely, requiring adaptable and innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Problem of Abundance and Navigation
While [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | innovation tools]] and methods offer new approaches to these [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]], [[empowering_public_servants | public servants]] often face a paradoxical situation: an overwhelming abundance of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Hundreds of valuable [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | innovation tools]], toolkits, guides, and playbooks already exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This surplus makes it difficult for [[empowering_public_servants | public servants]] to know where or how to begin addressing their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. What is truly needed is a more effective filter or a "compass" to guide them to the right resources for their [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | innovation journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The OPSI Toolkit Navigator
To address this navigational [[public_sector_challenges_and_transformations | challenge]], the OPSI Toolkit Navigator was developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This resource aims to connect a [[empowering_public_servants | public servant's]] specific situation, problem, or [[public_sector_challenges_and_transformations | challenge]] to the most relevant toolkit, helping to filter out extraneous information and clarify the path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The development of the OPSI Toolkit Navigator involved collaboration with hundreds of [[empowering_public_servants | public servants]] and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, and followed a structured approach:
1.  **Analysis and Organization** Existing toolkits were analyzed and organized based on the specific actions they inform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  **Situation Exploration** Common situations, problems, and [[public_sector_challenges_and_transformations | challenges]] frequently faced by [[empowering_public_servants | public servants]] were thoroughly explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  **User Conceptualization** Research was conducted into how [[empowering_public_servants | public servants]] typically articulate what they intend to do, and how they conceptualize their situations or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
4.  **Navigational Design** Navigational path options were designed to bridge the gap between common problems and suitable tools, allowing the Navigator to suggest tools based on desired actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Beyond Tool Selection
The creators acknowledge that [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] is more complex than simply finding the correct tool at the opportune moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Therefore, the OPSI Toolkit Navigator also facilitates connections to:
*   Resources for skills and capacity building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Real-world case studies demonstrating [[Challenges and Opportunities in Public Sector Innovation | innovation]] in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Other [[empowering_public_servants | public servants]] and experts who have experience with similar [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

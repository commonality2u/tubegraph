This article explores the evolving relationship between government and citizens, highlighting how [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democratic innovations]] are reshaping public decision-making and strengthening society's democratic fabric. The discussion took place during a conference hosted in partnership between the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation and the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, with support from the European Institute of Public Administration and the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## A Shifting Relationship: From Consumers to Citizens

There is a broad shift occurring in the relationship between government and citizens through various [[Role of citizen participation in innovation | democratic innovations]] at local, regional, and international levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. People's expectations about [[Citizen participation in policy making | public participation in public decision-making]] have changed, with citizens being less trusting of government but more engaged than ever on issues affecting them and their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Citizens want to contribute meaningfully to shaping decisions that impact them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

John Alexander, founder of the New Citizenship Project, suggests that current democratic relationships often operate under a "consumer democracy" model, where individuals choose from offered options rather than actively shaping them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. He argues that the same creativity and energy applied to consumerism should be invested in making [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democracy]] joyful, meaningful, and dynamic for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This shift is seen as an existential challenge: a move towards a more dynamic and [[Citizen participation in policy making | participatory mode of democracy]] is necessary to prevent losing [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democracy]] altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Democratic Innovations in Practice

### Agora Brussels

Pepin Kenny, an MP in the Brussels region parliament, exemplifies this shift with Agora Brussels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Agora advocates for the permanent installation of a [[Citizen assemblies and representation | citizen's assembly]], a deliberative body of randomly selected citizens that has a direct say in policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Agora ran for office to secure a seat, allowing them to organize these [[Citizen assemblies and representation | assemblies]] themselves and defend their decisions in parliament, thereby giving citizens a voice and making them agents of their own political change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This initiative aims to "give the city back to its citizens," fostering [[Public participation and trust in urban governance | citizen interests]] rather than political leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### We Do Democracy and "Democratic Fitness"

Zakia Elvang, co-founder of We Do Democracy in Denmark, emphasizes that [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democracy]] is a design that can be redesigned, not something carved in stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. She advocates for [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democracy]] as an activity to be practiced and trained, coining the term "democratic fitness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Her organization trains young people in "democratic muscles" like listening, empathy, compromising, and activism, creating "training arenas" for active and playful engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Conference on the Future of Europe

Gaitan, part of the common secretariat of the Conference on the Future of Europe, highlights this initiative as a significant [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democratic participatory exercise]] with a strong deliberative dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. It involves four randomly selected European [[Citizen assemblies and representation | citizens' panels]] reflecting on Europe's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. This conference also incorporates a multilingual [[Emerging technologies in civic engagement | digital platform]] for contributions and reports, and a unique plenary assembly mixing citizens, national parliamentarians, European parliamentarians, and local authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. This initiative is seen as entering innovative ground at a pan-European level, building [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democracy]] at both urban and transnational levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

## Challenges and Tensions in Democratic Innovation

### Power Dynamics and Meaningful Impact

A critical question is the actual "contract of power" offered to citizens in these processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. The shift in the relationship between citizen and state *must* be a shift in power, requiring states to trust citizens and meaningful power in their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. There's a concern that initiatives might disappoint or "let down" citizens if their contributions lead to one-sided conversations without real mandates or long-term relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. For the Conference on the Future of Europe, ensuring proposals translate into actual initiatives with accountability is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.

The challenge lies in ensuring that these processes lead to real impact, not just recommendations that politicians can cherry-pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. While the intention to empower citizens is often present, politicians are not always used to the idea that citizens set the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>. If outcomes aren't assured, such initiatives could be counterproductive, leading to frustration among participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.

### Digital vs. Analog Participation

The rise of [[Emerging technologies in civic engagement | digital platforms]] for engagement brings new challenges. Research suggests a significant increase in screen time, leading to concerns about people becoming accustomed to interaction at a distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. The importance of physical, face-to-face interaction for solving societal challenges remains immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

A related concern is the privatization of public space, both online and offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. When platforms for political discussion operate on business models based on advertising and consumption, it creates an unhealthy dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. Using private platforms like Zoom for democratic discussions, or relying on social media for [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democracy]], risks feeding "digital capitalism" or "digital feudalism" where users' data is monetized by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. Protecting privacy and allowing individuals to "switch off" are crucial for the future of [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democracy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.

### Trust, Legitimacy, and the "Yes, And" Approach

The tension lies in striking a balance: promoting more initiatives while ensuring they are done well and genuinely shift power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. If outputs are ignored or processes don't inspire confidence, it can do more harm than good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.

The concept of [[Citizen assemblies and representation | citizens' assemblies]] can be re-conceptualized not just as a new form of [[Citizen participation in policy making | citizen participation]], but as a new form of representation, where participants are "citizen representatives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. This requires rethinking and redesigning representative [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democracy]] rather than replacing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>.

Gaitan notes that these processes are not direct [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democracy]]; some recommendations will make their way into legislation, some will not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>. Clarity from the outset about expectations is crucial to manage disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>. Ideally, there would be a commitment to follow up on a certain percentage of recommendations, allowing for evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>. However, there's also the risk that politicians might pick only what they already intended to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. Transparency is key: "say what you do and do what you say" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>.

John Alexander emphasizes the "yes, and" approach: accepting opportunities for power when offered, and working to build energy within civil society to push for more, creating a virtuous cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. He notes that while progress is being made, there are also "terrifying directions" occurring simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.

## The Future of Democracy

A poll among participants revealed that 48% felt less hopeful about the future of [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democracy]] compared to the previous year, while 19% were more hopeful, and 34% felt about the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>.

John Alexander distinguishes between optimism and hope, citing Rebecca Solnit: optimism is the belief that things will be alright no matter what, while hope is a combination of clarity to see the world as it is and imagination to see what could be if one gets involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. This "hopeful" perspective encourages active participation in shaping the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>.

For the future, the focus should shift from expert-based solutions to people-centered solutions, identifying target groups, analyzing their needs through anthropological approaches like face-to-face interaction, and continuously testing and refining solutions *with* the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

There is a call for a cultural change in the media, encouraging them to report on innovative and peaceful [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democratic interactions]] rather than just conflicts, as visibility is necessary for impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

The private sector also plays a crucial role in [[Role of citizen participation in innovation | democratic innovation]], providing fast-paced, risk-willing, and innovative energy that can complement the long-term, representative aspects of public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. Physical democratic spaces, such as We Do Democracy's "Democracy Garage" in Copenhagen, are vital for bridging different "silos of [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democracy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a>.

The overall sentiment is that while progress is being made and momentum is building for [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democratic innovations]], the pace is too slow, and a significant shift in power relationships is still needed to achieve a truly inclusive, deliberative, and impactful [[Democracy and Public Participation in Policy | democracy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. The commitment is to continue pushing policymakers to listen to citizens and foster more meaningful [[Citizen participation in policy making | engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>.

The concept of [[innovation_and_technology_in_climate_mitigation | digital decarbonization]] addresses the environmental impact of data, specifically its carbon footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>. This emerging area of focus highlights that while we are surrounded by data, its environmental impact is often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>.

## The Growing Problem of Data's Carbon Footprint

The world generates a huge volume of data every minute across various sectors, including social media, finance, banking, and the [[public_sector_data_use_and_transformation | public sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:21">[03:51:21]</a>. It is estimated that nearly 80 zettabytes of data will be generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:21">[03:51:21]</a>. Data volume is doubling every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:17">[03:59:17]</a>.

Much of this data is stored in "the cloud," which physically resides in data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:16">[03:46:16]</a>. These data centers have a significant environmental impact, with their carbon footprint accounting for approximately 3% of global carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:52">[03:54:52]</a>. This percentage is notably higher than that of the aviation industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:17">[03:59:17]</a>.

### The "Data Iceberg"

Most of the data currently stored is inefficiently used, contributing to a looming environmental challenge likened to an "iceberg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:17">[03:59:17]</a>:
*   **Dark Data:** 65% of all stored data is considered "dark data," meaning it has been used once or never at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:17">[03:59:17]</a>. This often originates from IoT sensors collecting vast amounts of unused information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:17">[03:59:17]</a>.
*   **Outdated Data:** An additional 15% of data in data warehouses is outdated, a result of poor [[data_governance_and_digitallyenabled_state | information governance]] practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:17">[03:59:17]</a>.

These issues present a significant challenge to Net Zero efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:17">[03:59:17]</a>. Even seemingly small actions like sending emails or storing photos on cloud services contribute to this carbon footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:50">[04:40:50]</a>. For context, 100 employees working normally for 12 months generate data equivalent to 2,562 flights from London to New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:50">[04:40:50]</a>.

### Challenges in the Public Sector

[[Digitalization and government services | Digitalization efforts]] within the [[digital_transformation_in_government | public sector]] have been successful in storing data, but this "store all" approach has led to significant data duplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a>. Factors contributing to this include:
*   Siloed working environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a>.
*   Lack of inter-service and inter-departmental collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a>.
*   Growing demands on personnel time, making it easier to generate new data than to trace existing information for reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a>.

## Solutions and Proactive Measures

Addressing the carbon footprint of data requires both reactive and proactive approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:54">[04:51:54]</a>.

### Reactive Approach
This involves mapping the existing data landscape to identify CO2 hotspots where data is accumulating and bottlenecks occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:54">[04:51:54]</a>. The goal is to make current data stocks more efficient and environmentally friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:54">[04:51:54]</a>.

### Proactive Approach: The Data Carbon Ladder
A novel approach is the "Data Carbon Ladder," the first of its kind globally, which traces data from its origin through its entire journey to end-user use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:54">[04:51:54]</a>. This step-by-step process helps organizations diagnose different stages of data collection, processing, use, and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:54">[04:51:54]</a>.

Key questions to ask when using this approach include:
*   What is the minimum viable data set required to address tasks or manage requests? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:54">[04:51:54]</a>

Organisations often overlook these questions because they assume data is carbon neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:54">[04:51:54]</a>.

There is a push to include data content carbon emissions within government policies, as it is currently lacking globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:54">[04:51:54]</a>. This is critical given the increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI), which will further drive data generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:54">[04:51:54]</a>.

The government of Serbia's national AI supercomputing platform, for example, could inadvertently help reduce the carbon footprint by consolidating computing power, making it more efficient for businesses and individuals to leverage rather than setting up their own data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:56">[05:54:56]</a>.

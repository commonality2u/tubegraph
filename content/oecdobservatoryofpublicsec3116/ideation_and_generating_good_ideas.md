[[Ideation Techniques | Ideation]] is a strategic process that goes beyond simply brainstorming with sticky notes on a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It requires considering the specific context in which you are operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The goal is not just to generate ideas, but to generate *good* ideas and then effectively narrow them down to select those suitable for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Once potential solutions are identified, the next step is to transition from an idea to [[implementing_innovative_ideas | implementation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This often involves rallying people to your cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## From Idea to Action

An idea, no matter how innovative, needs to be developed into something actionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This applies whether it's an idea for a personal workspace test or a whole-of-government initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Better results are achieved when the idea fits the reality of the existing context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

This process often culminates in an [[developing_innovation_proposals | innovation proposal]], which can take various forms, from an email to a manager to a formal budget proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Tips for [[developing_innovation_proposals | Developing Successful Proposals]]

Developing innovation proposals can be a nerve-wracking time as it involves rallying people to an idea they may not be comfortable with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Key tips include:

*   **Understand the Strategic Context** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>: Even the best idea won't gain traction if the strategic context isn't right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Look for related agendas or political/executive leadership messages to which your idea can be linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Frame or reframe your idea to match the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Rally People to Your Cause** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>: Innovation is new, so there are often no ready mental models or examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Communicate with your audience and tailor your message to their preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Consider who would be the most effective voice for your proposal, even if it's not you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Don't Assume Your Idea's Merits Are Apparent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>: Innovative ideas are easily misinterpreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Make your proposal real and meaningful through:
    *   [[prototype_development_in_civic_innovation | Prototyping]] to make it visible and tangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   Finding peer voices to sell the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   Concrete use cases, highlighting current failures and successful instances elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
    *   Thinking through different scenarios, looking towards the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Know Your Numbers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>: Have a strong sense of what you're asking for, why, and the expected results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Be ready for questions, even though innovation often has a higher burden of proof than the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Consider the cost and risks of the current approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   Start small with a test case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   Promise with confidence, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
    *   Look for examples in other agencies or countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Nothing is Certain, Be Ready for the Unexpected** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>: Think about "what if X happens?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> What if they say yes and want it bigger, or if new information undercuts your hypothesis? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>
*   **Maximize Your Chances (Even with Failure)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>: While "fast failure" is a concept, the public sector often expects results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Consider how to gain learning, develop relationships, or deliver value even if the idea doesn't work as hoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Seek multiple payoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Don't Anticipate Everything, Be Open to Change** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>: Leave space for input from those receiving the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Managers often want to add their perspective and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

These tips hold true for various proposal formats (written, presentations, lightning pitches), though the depth of attention given to each may vary based on the scale of the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Common Issues with Proposals

*   **Do Decision-Makers Understand What They've Agreed To?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>: Due to the novelty of innovative ideas, misinterpretation is common. Watch for warning signs that there's a difference between what you're saying and what they're expecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   **Building in Flexibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>: Things will inevitably go differently than expected with innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Avoid building critical dependencies that leave you vulnerable to surprises, and don't be too specific if it limits adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Building an Escape Clause** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>: Consider how to exit a project if it doesn't work as hoped or if it deviates from your vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. This prevents endless investment in failing initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Also, ensure the innovation isn't solely reliant on you for sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   **Finding the Right Balance of Information** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>: Avoid patronizing decision-makers, but don't assume they know everything about a new idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. Test your proposal with various people (both familiar and unfamiliar with the issue) to find the right balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   **Beware of Scope Creep** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>: Scope creep can either expand the project beyond recognition or cut out its core innovative elements, making it unrecognizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. Be aware of and identify critical dependencies that could make or break the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

## Addressing Uncertainty and Failure

### Time and Impact Uncertainty
To manage the uncertainty of innovation project timelines and impacts, consider:
*   **[[prototype_development_in_civic_innovation | Prototyping]] and Low-Fidelity Testing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>: Early testing, even with simple methods like wireframes or role-playing service interactions, can provide valuable information about steps, dependencies, and potential issues, helping to flesh out the reality of the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **Starting Small and Low Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>: Frame problems and test hypotheses with minimal risk before moving to a full proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. For example, using duct tape and paper to prototype a product display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.
*   **Know Your Context** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>: Innovation approaches differ significantly across countries and organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.
*   **Personal Confidence and Comfort** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>: Start with small experiments within your own job discretion to build confidence before pushing larger ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

### Managing Expectations and Buzzwords
When government loves to use "innovation" as a buzzword, managing expectations is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. There's no easy answer, but key strategies include:
*   **Building a Common Language of Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>: Help align expectations by communicating that an innovation project inherently involves uncertainty and discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. If these two elements are absent, it's likely not true innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   **Bringing in External Voices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>: Stakeholders, partner organizations, or other agencies with innovation experience can help shape more realistic and nuanced expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
*   **Seeking Political Cover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>: While risky if leadership changes, strong political or senior leadership commitment can sometimes overcome barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

### When Proposals are Rejected
If a proposal you deeply believe in gets rejected:
*   **Wait for the Right Time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>: Sometimes, the timing isn't right, and waiting for a more suitable context can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Reframe the Idea** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>: Re-listen to political signals and reframe your idea to better connect with current priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   **Build a Coalition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>: If you're too far ahead of your audience, build support among colleagues or others who understand the idea's importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Find Outside Voices/Sponsors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>: External stakeholders, organizations, or even the private sector can advocate for your idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
*   **Personal Strategies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>: Some adopt a "rule of three" attempts before giving up on an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. Others may choose to pursue the idea with fewer resources or "behind the scenes" if they truly believe in its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.
*   **Seek Insight** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>: Ask decision-makers why your idea didn't resonate, or what information you might be missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.
*   **Find Workarounds or Other Sponsors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>: If your direct management line is too busy, seek support from other leaders or areas, though this carries its own risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.

### Communicating "Failure"
Government often avoids the word "failure," but it's important to reframe it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. When starting small and testing, if things don't work, you've limited your exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. Learning should be a primary goal, especially in high-uncertainty projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>.

The line between success and failure can be "wafer-thin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. Innovation involves chance due to high uncertainty, and external events can unexpectedly turn perceived failures into successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. It's crucial to nuance the concepts of success and failure, recognizing many shades of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>. The key is to ensure that every effort has multiple payoffs, delivering value even if the primary objective isn't met exactly as hoped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

The co-creation boot camp brought together 100 individuals from the public sector, private sector, academia, and civil society organizations to [[developing_innovation_proposals | co-create solutions]] for civic participation challenges [00:00:21]. These challenges were presented by public sector teams from Portugal, Spain, and the Netherlands, who were committed to collaborating with society and leveraging emerging technologies [00:00:35]. The challenges focused on people-centric approaches, utilizing technologies like AI, blockchain, and VR to enhance democratic participation and promote inclusive governance [00:00:50].

To transition from challenges to prototype solutions, participants worked in teams and followed a process designed by the OECD, structured as a design sprint [00:01:03].

## Design Sprint Stages

### Aligning on the Challenge
The initial step for teams was to align on the given challenge [00:01:14]. This involved a comprehensive understanding of not only the problem itself but also its context and any prior attempts to address it [00:01:19]. Teams also identified key stakeholders and users, potential barriers to implementation, and the desired outcomes [00:01:27]. This foundational stage ensured a shared understanding of the challenge and established a clear direction for subsequent work [00:01:37].

### [[ideation_process_and_strategies | Ideation]] of Solutions
Following the alignment phase, teams delved into the [[ideation_process | ideation process]] for solutions [00:01:54]. This involved rapidly brainstorming ideas, discussing them, and prioritizing those that best addressed the challenge [00:01:56].

### Solution Sketching
The most promising ideas were then developed further through solution sketching [00:02:13]. Teams created one well-articulated solution sketch for each of the best ideas that emerged from the [[ideation_process | ideation]] phase [00:02:15]. This involved quickly drawing to give shape and form to the solutions on paper [00:02:23].

### Refining and Selecting Ideas
After sketching and discussing, teams took time to review and refine their ideas [00:02:35]. The goal was to narrow down the possibilities and select the single best idea for [[prototyping_ideas_in_civic_tech | prototyping]] [00:02:39].

### Prototyping
The second day of the boot camp was dedicated entirely to [[prototyping_ideas_in_civic_tech | developing this idea]] further [00:02:49]. The objective was to create a prototype of the selected solution [00:02:58]. Teams began by developing a minimal prototype canvas based on their sketches from the previous day [00:03:01]. They explored various approaches, with some utilizing digital [[innovation_tools_and_methods | tools]] and emerging technologies, while others opted for traditional materials like Legos and modeling clay to achieve a tangible representation of their solution as quickly as possible [00:03:07].

### Pitching Solutions
As the boot camp concluded, teams prepared for the final pitches of their solutions [00:03:27]. Their task was to showcase what they had built over the two days in a five-minute presentation to other participants and a jury of experts from Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and the European Commission [00:03:36].

Following the pitches, three solutions were chosen for further development [00:03:51]. These selected prototypes were recognized for their ability to push the boundaries of civic participation through emerging technologies [00:03:53]. The ideas developed during this process are anticipated to shape the future of civic participation across Europe [00:04:12].

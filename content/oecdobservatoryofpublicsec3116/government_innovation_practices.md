One of the most common [[government_innovation_strategies | government innovation practices]] is **Enhancement Oriented Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Enhancement Oriented Innovation

This type of [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] focuses on upgrading what already exists within [[public_sector_innovation | government]] systems and practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The goal is to enhance current systems that the government already has in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Examples
*   Making taxation systems work better, faster, or quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Using behavioral insights to encourage citizens to pay taxes faster or respond to inquiries in a more informed manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Characteristics and Risks
Enhancement oriented innovation is characterized by relatively low risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These [[types_of_innovation_within_public_sector_organizations | innovations]] do not call for the transformation of entire systems; instead, they are implemented within existing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The risks associated with their implementation can also be calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

This approach allows for either directing [[innovation in the public sector | innovation]] to improve a specific system or exploiting existing ideas to enhance what is currently in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

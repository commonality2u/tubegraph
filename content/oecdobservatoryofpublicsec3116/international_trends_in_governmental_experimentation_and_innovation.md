Governments engage in [[government innovation practices | innovation practices]] for various reasons, some with clear objectives and others for broader exploration and capability building. Both approaches are considered beneficial for [[public sector innovation and global trends | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Reasons for Governmental Innovation

### 1. Problem-Driven Innovation
One primary reason for government [[Innovation Strategies for Governments | innovation]] is to address specific, known challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples include cleaning up oceans or solving homelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. In these instances, [[public sector innovation and global trends | innovation]] is precisely directed towards achieving a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This approach is straightforward for structuring [[innovation_strategies_for_governments | innovation]] in government, as the problem itself legitimizes the need for new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### 2. Innovation for Exploration and Creativity
Governments also innovate simply for the sake of it, allowing individuals to explore new ideas and be creative in addressing citizen challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. [[Innovation for exploration and creativity in government | The nature of innovation]] is that it is new and uncertain, meaning the "next big thing" is often unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This approach enables people to explore new concepts. In the private sector, this is termed "entrepreneurial discovery," where transformative ideas often come from those with the freedom to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The public sector also needs to allow for this, as its services and products require continuous renewal and transformation to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### 3. Capacity Building and Learning by Doing
A third reason for civil servants to innovate is to develop their own [[experimentation_and_learning_in_government | ability to innovate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Innovation is a learned skill; individuals learn to explore and think in new ways by actively engaging in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This "learning by doing" approach means governments need to permit experimentation with new ideas and their practical application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Building this capacity ensures that when major new [[challenges_in_governmental_innovation_and_reform | challenges]] arise, there are people with the expertise to develop new projects and solve problems effectively because they have prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### 4. Avoiding Being Left Behind
Sometimes, [[government experimentation and case studies | governmental innovation]] is driven by the desire to keep pace with other entities, such as neighboring countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This is also considered a valid reason, as unexplored options represent a potential cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Like private sector companies that continuously explore new solutions and ideas, governments must engage in similar exploration to remain relevant and prepared for future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## International Trends in Experimentation
There is a growing trend in governments to embrace experimentation:
*   **Finland:** Has initiated a new program focused on experimentation at the central government level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Canada:** Implemented an experimentation directive, allowing different government departments to test policy ideas before widespread implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

These varied motivations for [[public sector innovation trends | innovation]] necessitate different methods and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

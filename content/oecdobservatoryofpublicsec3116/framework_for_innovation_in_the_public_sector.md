Anticipatory Innovation Governance (AIG) is a framework designed to help governments and public organizations proactively address future challenges and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This approach aims to build a system where the creation of future knowledge actively informs and drives innovation within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>.

## Origin and Development
The idea for Anticipatory Innovation Governance at the OECD began in late 2018, originating from discussions with Sweden's Vinnova, a leading innovation agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The initial discussions focused on how countries and public organizations could prepare for different types of innovation within the framework of the Observatory's [[facets_of_public_sector_innovation | innovation model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Vinnova was the first supporter, allowing the analysis of their [[innovation_portfolios_in_the_public_sector | innovation portfolio]] and providing insights into AIG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## The Need for Anticipatory Innovation Governance
The world is characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and novelty (VUCA), presenting complex problems for governments and [[public_sector_innovation | public organizations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Innovator's Dilemma in the Public Sector
Established practices and policies can become outdated as environmental conditions change and new ideas emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Current stakeholders often provide information based on existing services, not anticipating future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. New, transformative ideas may initially underperform existing systems, making stakeholder feedback potentially misleading in early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Leadership's focus on current challenges can divert attention from future risks and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Organizational resistance to change is also a significant barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Ignoring new transformations, as seen with companies like Canon and Nokia, is not a viable strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Control vs. Impact Dilemma
In the early phases of technological development, the possibility to control change is much larger than in later phases when the innovation is developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. While evidence of potential impacts increases over time, the ability to control innovations diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. For example, influencing platform economies like Uber was possible early on, but becomes very difficult once they have millions of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Governments must consider technological and non-technological changes early to influence values and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This requires a different approach to evidence creation and experimentation, rather than a "wait and see" position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Static vs. Continuous Futures Practice
Governments often view the future from a static perspective, using tools like the traditional futures cone for strategic planning every five or ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. However, this approach is insufficient because reality is dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. To be impactful, anticipatory and strategic foresight knowledge in government requires continuous practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Futures are created through ongoing dialogue in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Impact Gap in Strategic Foresight
Strategic foresight is crucial for anticipating innovation, providing input by identifying signals, reading weak signals, and validating strong signals about future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. However, strategic foresight within governments tends to be siloed, leading to an "impact gap" where insights are not translated into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Reasons for this gap include:
*   Producing information that challenges current practices and is thus undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.
*   Lack of concrete actions or implementation pathways for foresight insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   Governments believing they control innovation and the future, despite evidence to the contrary (e.g., missed pandemic forecasts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   Aversion to challenging assumptions and values, as future insights might indicate current approaches are wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>.
*   Leadership often focuses on immediate crises, neglecting long-term risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.
*   A tendency towards linear thinking and presenting as experts, which hinders addressing uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

## Defining Key Concepts
The framework clarifies the distinction between anticipation, innovation, and Anticipatory Innovation Governance:

*   **Anticipation:** The creation of knowledge about the future, drawn from existing contextual factors, underlying values, worldviews, assumptions, and emerging developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. It's an ongoing act of knowledge creation connected to the potentiality and possibility of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
*   **Innovation:** Acting upon that knowledge by innovating the system (process, service, product) and exploring alternative futures on the ground to influence the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. It's about being part of creating or moving towards a preferable future, not just waiting for things to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory Innovation Governance:** A system – in terms of its structures, institutions, agencies, and environment – that supports the activity of anticipation and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. It addresses the inability within governments to test critical, contradictory, or transformative ideas that go beyond current paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.

## Building an Anticipatory Innovation Governance System
Building an AIG system is not a day's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>. Experienced government foresight practitioners focus on five key system elements, built simultaneously:

1.  **Demand:** Cultivating a leadership culture that actively seeks and demands strategic foresight and anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
2.  **Capacity:** Developing the necessary knowledge and skills (e.g., horizon scanners, scenario planners) within the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
3.  **Embeddedness:** Ensuring that other system elements, such as electoral cycles and policy reviews, are coordinated with anticipatory activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. It's crucial to know in advance how, when, and by whom insights will be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
4.  **Institutions and Teams:** Establishing dedicated institutions and teams responsible for anticipatory innovation and ensuring they connect with wider stakeholders responsible for implementing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.
5.  **Feedback:** Implementing systems to evaluate how well anticipation was used and identify areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

These components need to be developed to build agency and address vested interests and cognitive biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. An authorizing environment is also needed to support this activity, providing feedback through data, measurement, and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. The specific roles and combinations of these factors will vary depending on the system (e.g., centralized vs. decentralized) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

### Practical Implementation and Examples
Organizations can start by:
*   **Making the case for change:** This involves understanding the system, defining roles, and determining how strategic foresight information can be integrated into digestible formats for action and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.
*   **Building leadership capacity:** Equipping leaders to engage with futures, foresight, and anticipatory issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.
*   **Developing sense-making teams:** Teams that collect weak signals and phenomena within their field and explore their implications for current practices and potential innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. Examples include social insurance and tax offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>.
*   **Creating test beds:** Becoming a test bed for future-oriented projects and integrating learnings into broader organizational practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.

**Case Studies:**
*   **Finland:** Has one of the most advanced strategic foresight systems in government, but faces the implementation challenge of integrating this knowledge into decision-making and innovative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. Finland's system has devolved capacity to different ministries, allowing for quicker responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.
*   **Helsingborg, Sweden:** Consciously decided to become an anticipatory organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>. Their journey started with building leadership capacity among city managers and political representatives to discuss futures and foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. This enabled decisions to support anticipatory innovation projects as test beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>. They are now focusing on integrating learnings from these tests into the broader city practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.
*   **Ireland:** The OECD is working with the Irish government to understand and build an AIG system, including outlining roles, coordination mechanisms (centralized vs. decentralized), and capacities needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.
*   **Slovenia:** Working on specific topics related to the future of the [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]], talent management, and aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a>.
*   **Latvia:** Focused on building and managing anticipatory ecosystems around different technologies from a [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]] perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>.

## Distinguishing Anticipatory Innovation Governance from Related Concepts

AIG is not a replacement for, but rather complements, other important concepts in public sector management.

### Resilience and Adaptation
*   **Resilience:** A system's ability to prepare, absorb, recover, and adapt in the event of a disruption, ensuring the system expands but does not break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>. It's about being prepared for risks and changes while upholding core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>.
*   **Adaptation/Agility:** The capacity to respond tactically and adapt quickly to ongoing changes and crises, often without extensive strategic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:18">[01:35:18]</a>.
*   **AIG's Role:** While AIG can feed into resilience, it is not the same. Fundamental societal changes require governments to fundamentally change, not just be resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>. Anticipation provides information on when resilience is no longer sufficient, and new structures are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>. AIG also makes other resilient and adaptive capacities stronger, helping to guide overall [[innovation portfolios in the public sector | innovation portfolios]] and ensure governments are moving in the right strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>.

### Mission-Oriented Innovation
*   **Mission-driven innovation:** Led by a single, agreed-upon purpose or goal, such as decarbonizing an economy by a specific timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:09">[01:20:09]</a>. It legitimizes and drives innovation towards that one goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a>.
*   **AIG's Role:** While missions provide focus, AIG ensures governments are not "locked in" to specific solutions. It anticipates unexpected outcomes, alternative technological solutions, or side effects (e.g., job displacement from green transitions) that missions might create, allowing for proactive planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.

### Strategic Foresight
*   **Strategic foresight:** Focuses on creating knowledge about potential futures, identifying signals and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>. It informs both risk assessment frameworks and opportunity identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26">[01:11:26]</a>.
*   **AIG's Role:** AIG addresses the "impact gap" or "implementation gap" of strategic foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. It provides the mechanisms to take the knowledge created by strategic foresight and translate it into actionable, value-shifting innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>. Strategic foresight is an essential input for AIG, but it is not sufficient on its own to drive real change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:39">[01:12:39]</a>.

## Future Directions
The OECD is continuing to develop the AIG framework, with upcoming publications including an overview of the concept and a working paper on its theoretical foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:32">[01:06:32]</a>. Future work will explore mechanisms for agency in anticipatory innovation and building an authorizing environment that supports and evaluates this work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. Current projects include work with Finland, Slovenia, Latvia, and ongoing tests of different methodologies in various OECD countries to integrate anticipatory innovation into [[innovation portfolios in the public sector | innovation portfolios]] and organizational aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.

Measurement and evaluation for AIG requires a different system than standard [[public_sector_innovation | public sector]] practices, given the need to make decisions and take action without immediate evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:32">[01:24:32]</a>.

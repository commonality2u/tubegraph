Empowering women, particularly in the world's poorest and most remote communities, is a significant focus for organizations working towards sustainable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. One such initiative is Barefoot College International, which leverages renewable energy to drive social and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

## Barefoot College International: A Model for Empowerment

Barefoot College International, based in India, operates on the Gandhian principle of "Leave No Man Behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. They work with communities in 93 countries across Latin America, Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and 14 Pacific Island states, recognizing the inherent potential within these populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. Their programs address 14 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

The flagship program is an innovative, multifaceted women-led initiative focused on access to clean energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. They train women, many of whom are illiterate or semi-literate, to become solar engineers, known as the "Solar Mamas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. These women return to their communities to build, install, and maintain solar systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

### The "Enrich" Co-Curriculum

Based on community feedback, Barefoot College also developed a co-curriculum called "Enrich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. This curriculum focuses on "soft skills" and aims to enhance women's aspirations, confidence, and competences in areas such as:
*   Financial inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>
*   Digital inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>
*   Women's health, particularly reproductive health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>
*   Microenterprise skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>
*   Civil society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>
*   Human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>
*   Environmental sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>

This co-curriculum is provided because access to energy alone is not considered sufficient; the goal is to provide tools and knowledge to leverage that access into other competencies for long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

### Impact and Benefits

The program creates a range of benefits:
*   **Energy Access** Provides light from dusk till dawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.
*   **Water Management** Enables the pumping of water, significantly saving time for women who traditionally collect water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
*   **Education Outcomes** Improves education for children doing homework at night and extends the learning day for adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.
*   **Health Outcomes** Reduces exposure to black smoke from kerosene, improving health for women and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
*   **[[empowering_public_servants | Empowerment of women and girls]]** This is particularly crucial in parts of the world where girls are married off at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
*   **Environmental Sustainability** Contributes to broader [[supporting_innovation_for_sustainable_development | sustainable development]] goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
*   **Livelihood Development** Helps families generate income by enabling two people to earn within a household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

This power platform facilitates social and economic growth by putting education and technology into the hands of communities, fostering self-sufficiency and agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. Access to energy specifically solves significant issues related to time poverty, especially in remote regions where traditional grid access is too costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

Women are seen as catalysts for change, often being an untapped resource who are marginalized, uneducated, and restricted to household roles, leaving little time for aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. A 2015 McKinsey report indicated that achieving gender parity could increase world GDP by 26%, surpassing the combined GDP of the USA and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. An example from Timbuktu, Africa, demonstrated this impact when a newly trained solar engineer challenged traditional norms by attending a headman's meeting, asserting her identity as an engineer rather than just a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

## Partnerships and Government Engagement

Barefoot College actively seeks proactive investment and support to scale its model, working with governments, private organizations, and other NGOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Key to securing buy-in from governments is demonstrating the initiative's impact and its ability to address challenges those governments are already trying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>.

Examples of successful government partnerships include:
*   **Zanzibar** The President highlighted the importance of "Solar Mamas" as part of their energy policy to reach last-mile communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.
*   **Madagascar** The government partnered in building a Regional Training Center, planning to train 744 solar engineers and electrify 630,000 homes by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.
*   **Fiji** The government is establishing a Regional Training Center, and the Minister for Women in Parliament emphasized its role in [[empowering_public_servants | empowering women]] in rural communities, linking it to increased educational outcomes, women's empowerment, and economic productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.

## Adapting to Challenges: The COVID-19 Response

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Barefoot College quickly recognized the economic hardship faced by many communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. They pivoted aspects of their microenterprise training to help meet new needs, such as producing PPE equipment in Zanzibar, allowing communities to profit while fighting the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. The organization also reassessed supply chains and invested significant time and funding to ensure communities did not go hungry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. They learned that communities are capable of long-term self-sufficiency but need help with sudden, sharp shortfalls in income and resources caused by larger economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

The ability to be nimble and use technological [[Emergent innovations from missionoriented projects | innovation]] has been crucial in adapting to global challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. However, it's also important to remember that not everything can be digitized; the human-centric approach must be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.

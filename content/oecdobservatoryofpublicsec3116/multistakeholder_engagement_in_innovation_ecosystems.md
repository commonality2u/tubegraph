## Introduction
The increasing pace of change and diversifying problems necessitate new approaches to public sector innovation, moving beyond one-size-fits-all solutions. This has led to a focus on [[innovation_ecosystems_and_portfolio_management | stewarding innovation portfolios]] for collective system change, particularly in [[ecosystems_and_multistakeholder_collaboration | multi-stakeholder environments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) has been researching [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | innovation portfolios]] as an emerging and crucial practice for governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Why Multistakeholder Environments?
Governments are increasingly expected to handle diverse challenges, as evidenced by recent global events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While there isn't a single rigorous or standard practice for [[innovation_ecosystems_and_portfolio_management | innovation portfolio management]], various emerging practices are being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The core challenge is how to manage portfolios in a [[multi-stakeholder_environment | multi-stakeholder environment]] or [[ecosystem | ecosystem]], especially when changes go beyond an organization's or even the public sector's borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This involves understanding how to build legitimacy, foster collective action, and sustain momentum for portfolio transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Key Research Questions
Research by OPSI and observations from organizations implementing portfolios highlight several challenges and questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>:
*   What led to the current portfolio, considering policy context, organizational environment, and goals? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>
*   Who is [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | stewarding the portfolio]], explicitly or implicitly? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
*   Are there strategies and policies supporting each "facet" or type of innovation? Organizations often excel in one or two facets, like efficiency-led (enhancement-oriented innovation) or challenge-focused (mission-oriented innovation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   Is the current balance of the [[innovation_portfolio | innovation portfolio]] indicative of a temporary or long-term trend? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   Is the balance supportive of the overall organizational remit or public purpose? Portfolios may sometimes be at odds with stated objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   What roles do different [[ecosystem | ecosystem]] actors play in shaping the portfolio? Innovation portfolios should be viewed from a wider [[ecosystem | ecosystem]] perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   What roles are needed to [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | steward innovation portfolios]] within teams, organizations, or wider [[ecosystem | ecosystems]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>

### The Innovation Facets Model
OPSI uses its Innovation Facets Model as a framework for [[innovation_ecosystems_and_portfolio_management | portfolio management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This model describes the broad purposes of innovation and has been used with governments at national, regional, and sub-national levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. It's one of many frameworks, but its value lies in providing intentional attention to portfolio management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

The model differentiates between four facets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>:
*   **Mission-oriented innovation:** Addressing overall challenges and societal goals in a top-down, directed way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation:** Improving existing practices, making them more efficient and widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation:** Responding to new or expressed needs by creating spaces for bottom-up exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation:** Looking at extreme uncertainty and shaping future changes based on potential developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Using this framework, the first step is reflection: clarifying what exists and for what purpose, understanding relationships between activities, and identifying potential directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This helps to make sense of the system's setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Drivers of Portfolio Transitions
Beyond contextual factors, such as a devolved government structure like Sweden's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, portfolio transitions are driven by various factors, including scandals, societal changes, and technology shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The key question is whether an organization has the right mix of options and choices for its context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Forces, structures, processes, aptitudes, preferences, and circumstances all push innovative activity in different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

There is always an [[innovation_portfolio | innovation portfolio]], whether intentional or not, but often it's not managed intentionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. The challenge is deciding if the current mix is satisfactory and what mix *should* exist, a question often tied to political considerations and the preference of certain public values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### Stewardship at the System Level
Innovation can pull a system in different directions, potentially threatening its coherence, compatibility, and interoperability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. The need for innovation constantly changes, raising the question of how much proactivity to add to these shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. While no single person or group can fully control an [[innovation_ecosystem | innovation ecosystem]], a form of stewardship at the collective level is essential to provide an overall view of what is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

## Case Studies from Sweden

### Viable Cities
Viable Cities is a Swedish program with a mission to achieve [[climate_neutral_cities | climate neutral cities]] by 2030, ensuring a good life for all within planetary boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. This program operates with a [[mission_oriented_approach | mission-oriented approach]] to [[systems_transformation | systems transformation]], which is gaining traction globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. Its budget over 12 years is approximately 100 million euros, funded by three government agencies: Vinnova, the Swedish Energy Agency, and Formas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. Viable Cities has 100 member organizations representing the quadruple helix: companies, public organizations, academia/research institutes, and civil society organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

The main purpose of their [[innovation_ecosystems_and_portfolio_management | portfolio strategy]] is to align climate transition and sustainability efforts for more impactful achievement of their mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. They address challenges like fragmentation and "projectification" in research, innovation, and scaling efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.

#### Key Tools and Practices
*   **Climate City Contract (CCC):** A flagship effort initiated in 2019, involving nine (expanding to 20) Swedish cities and four government agencies. The CCC is a negotiated collaboration signed yearly by mayors and director generals, assigning commitments to national and local organizations for faster climate transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. It is seen as the "epicenter" of their work, guiding their portfolio strategy and influencing actions in Sweden, the EU, and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>.
*   **Transition Lab:** A mechanism for accelerating learning among municipalities and [[engaging_stakeholders_in_innovation | other stakeholders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. It clarifies common direction, leverages synergies, renews decision-making processes, and builds dynamic capabilities for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.
*   **Open Calls:** Used to find interested cities globally, even without initial funding, such as the Climate Smart Cities Challenge, which connects cities in Brazil, Uganda, Colombia, and the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. This helps to focus diverse [[stakeholders]] and promotes experimentation and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:09">[01:14:09]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Grants:** Grants are used as a lever to trigger innovations in urban governance, with analysis and dialogues influencing upcoming grant calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>.

#### Role in the Ecosystem
Viable Cities sees its role as a "mission driver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>. They connect governmental agencies, municipalities, and other relevant actors, including other portfolios, by focusing on needs and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>. They coordinate, inspire, create collaboration opportunities, and conduct analysis, emphasizing that the cities and their citizens are at the very center, driving the initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. The focus is on specific challenge areas, like mobility, where real barriers often lie at the policy or investment level, rather than solely on technological solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:12">[01:25:12]</a>.

#### Portfolio of Portfolios
The concept of a "portfolio of portfolios" emerges, as achieving the mission requires aligning and connecting efforts across different actors and governance levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>. This necessitates thinking about "open interfaces" to facilitate connections between portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. Viable Cities aligns its activities with other strategic innovation programs, like "Drive Sweden," committed to the same mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

### Future by Lund
Future by Lund is an innovation platform within the municipality of Lund, a university city in southern Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. It connects companies, organizations, city departments, and university faculties in a [[multi-stakeholder_environment | multi-stakeholder environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. Their work is characterized by accepting fragmentation, knowing that no one dictates over anyone else, and relying on [[trust_and_coordination_in_multistakeholder_partnerships | trust]], negotiation, and timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.

#### Key Tools and Practices
*   **Zone Model:** A framework used to categorize work based on uncertainty and risk. The "yellow zone" involves exploratory work with high uncertainty, creating concepts and projects. The "green zone" signifies mature concepts ready for implementation and upscaling by organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.
*   **Innovation Facets Model Integration:** They overlay their zone model with the Innovation Facets Model, viewing it as a way of moving activities and projects across zones and facilitating handovers between different actors in the [[innovation_ecosystem | innovation ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.
*   **"Barbecue Model":** An informal yet powerful tool for building [[trust_and_coordination_in_multistakeholder_partnerships | trust]] and fostering collaboration. The idea is that if all partners can gather for a barbecue, it signifies success, as the impact will naturally happen when people with shared goals come together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:38">[01:21:38]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of building social capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>.
*   **Snapshots and Visual Maps:** They create snapshots of their portfolio, mapping project involvement across themes (e.g., mobility, digitalization) or specific territories. This helps the team understand connections and identify where projects are situated within the zones (exploring vs. impacting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

#### Role in the Ecosystem
Future by Lund acts as a neutral facilitator, working "in the gaps" between business, city, and university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>. Their credibility stems from their transparency and neutrality, as they don't seek to own or profit from the initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>.

Their daily work involves:
*   **Idea Tracking and Matching:** Continuously engaging with individuals through meetings and conversations to identify needs, wants, and ideas. They assess potential and match ideas with resources and assets to move them forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>.
*   **Facilitation and Support:** Helping individuals and organizations achieve their visions and transform the system. This involves knowing when to push, when to step back, and when to accept that they don't own the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.
*   **Translating Different "Languages":** Understanding that different stakeholders have different motivations and "languages" (e.g., companies' business goals vs. city's public service goals). They help decipher these, showing how different efforts align with the shared mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a>.
*   **Building a Common Vocabulary:** A fundamental step is establishing a common vocabulary and frame of reference for what an [[innovation_portfolio | innovation portfolio]] is and what it's for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. This allows for collective management and movement of the portfolio over time, involving diverse perspectives from academics, practitioners, and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

## Common Themes and Practices

### Addressing Fragmentation and Projectification
Both Viable Cities and Future by Lund highlight the issue of fragmentation and "projectification" – where efforts are siloed into discrete projects without a cohesive strategic overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. A portfolio approach, especially a "portfolio of portfolios," helps to align and connect these disparate efforts across different actors and governance levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>.

### Building Legitimacy and Trust
In [[multi-stakeholder_environment | multi-stakeholder environments]], where no single entity has absolute control, [[trust_and_coordination_in_multistakeholder_partnerships | building trust]] and legitimacy is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>. Future by Lund emphasizes transparency and neutrality as key to their credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>. Viable Cities focuses on mobilizing political leadership at the local level and linking local efforts to broader national and international mandates (like climate goals) to ensure sustained legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:08">[01:52:08]</a>.

### Measuring Impact in Complex Systems
Evaluating impact in [[innovation_ecosystems_and_portfolio_management | innovation portfolios]] and [[systems_transformation | transformative change]] is a complex, "black box" topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>. Standard evaluation models are often insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:36">[01:42:36]</a>. Instead of focusing solely on easily measurable quantitative results (like CO2 emissions reductions), the focus shifts to:
*   **Developing Capabilities:** Building the "muscle" for [[systems_transformation | transformative change]], empowering collective learning capacity, and enhancing the ability to drive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>.
*   **Process Tracking and Developmental Evaluation:** Structured tracking of [[systems_transformation | transformative change]] processes, continuous feedback, and qualitative insights to inform strategic adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>. This helps to show progression and scale-up effects of initial exploratory activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>.
*   **Storytelling:** Tracing critical events and telling the "impact story" to communicate progress and complexity over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.

### Learning and Reflexivity
Both cases highlight the importance of continuous learning and reflexivity. Viable Cities integrates a "learning history" approach to encourage structured reflection and institutionalize learning within municipalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>. Future by Lund emphasizes that the insights and reflections gained from mapping and discussing the portfolio are key to driving things forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>. Looking internationally to learn from best practices and adapt them to local contexts is also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:30">[01:39:30]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[Multistakeholder engagement in innovation ecosystems]] is an emerging but vital area of practice. It requires intentional [[innovation_ecosystems_and_portfolio_management | portfolio management]], a focus on shared missions, and adaptive tools and approaches. While challenges in evaluation and political communication exist, establishing common language, building trust, and fostering continuous learning are foundational to achieving collective system change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:48">[01:53:48]</a>.

### OPSI Tools for Portfolio Management
The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) offers several tools:
*   **Innovation Portfolio Exploration Workshop:** A gamified, downloadable resource for making sense of portfolios, testing transitions, and leveraging assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:45">[01:57:45]</a>.
*   **Self-Service Portfolio Exploration Tool:** For a quick snapshot of how support structures and activities influence a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:24">[01:58:24]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Exploration Tool Guide:** For running discussions around portfolio management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:43">[01:58:43]</a>.

OPSI is also building a community of practice to continue exploring unanswered questions and advance the practice of [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | innovation portfolio stewardship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>.

The development of [[Public Service Skills and Development | skills and capabilities]] for designing and delivering digital services is crucial for governments, impacting both public servants and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This development is part of a broader strategy for [[digital_transformation_of_public_services | digital transformation]] and innovation in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Challenges to Skills and Capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>

Key challenges include:
*   **Citizen capabilities** Many citizens either do not want to use or are not capable of using online channels to interact with public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. For example, in France, a large portion of the population is uncomfortable with or lacks access to digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. In Portugal, a significant percentage of the population has never used the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. Polls indicate "skills and capabilities of citizens" as a primary challenge for "digital by default" concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **Public servant digital mindset** If public servants lack the [[Innovation Skills for Public Sector | skills and capabilities]] and understanding of agile ways of working, government cannot react quickly to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Lack of internal collaboration** The absence of collaboration within government to solve problems is identified as a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

## Importance of Skills and Mindset

The [[future_skills_in_the_public_sector | knowledge and skills]] of service providers are crucial for the success of digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. A "digital mindset" is considered a blend of skills and agile working practices, which needs support from top leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. It is essential for civil servants to possess the [[Innovation Skills for Public Sector | skills]] and willingness to work in agile ways, supported by organizational structures that enable such approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Digital skills are vital for developing in-house capabilities and for effectively procuring the right technologies and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Collaboration, culture, mindset, and skills must be incentivized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## Initiatives and Strategies for Skills Development

Countries are implementing various strategies to enhance [[Public Service Skills and Development | skills and capabilities]] for [[Digital Transformation of Public Services | digital transformation]]:

### For Public Servants
*   **Systematic Improvement:** Slovenia is systematically improving the [[Public Service Skills and Development | knowledge and skills]] of its service providers through an administration academy, aiming to accelerate the development of a modern business culture with improved cooperation and user focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Expert Deployment:** France has deployed "UX commandos" – teams of experts including designers, developers, user researchers, and data scientists – to work on specific key performance indicators within existing services, such as improving accessibility or user satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. This approach aims to not only improve services but also change how teams think about producing digital services, fostering a culture of user testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.
*   **Workshops and Observation:** Government designers and developers in France are encouraged to spend time in "mediation centers" (places where people get help with digital services) to observe users and understand the need for simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>. Similarly, in Portugal, "citizen spaces" are used to observe how citizens interact with digital channels with the help of a mediator, providing insights for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.
*   **National Programs:** Portugal has a national program called "Encode" which includes measures to improve [[digital_transformation_and_inclusion_in_government_services | digital literacy]] for citizens, companies, and public servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>.

### For Citizens
*   **Physical Assistance:** Countries like Slovenia, France, and Portugal maintain physical administrative units or "one-stop shops" where citizens can receive counseling and assistance with digital services, catering to those who prefer or need face-to-face interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. Portugal also offers "mobile citizen spaces" (vans) to reach remote areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **Digital Literacy Programs:**
    *   France has launched a "digital pass" program, offering coupons for free classes to increase [[digital_transformation_and_inclusion_in_government_services | digital skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>.
    *   France has trained 4,000 "digital advisors" or teachers to provide on-the-ground support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>.
    *   Slovenia is considering special digital vouchers for e-skills and introducing computer science as a subject in primary and secondary schools as a long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>.
*   **User Research and Inclusive Design:** Services should conduct research with a broad range of users, including those who are less comfortable with digital tools or have disabilities, to ensure inclusivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>.
*   **Clear Communication:** Using clear, understandable language is critical to increasing the use of digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. France uses a simplified language (FALC – *Français Facile à Lire et à Comprendre*) for critical communications, such as for their COVID-19 tracker app, to ensure wider accessibility and transparency regarding data use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>.

## Impact on Digital Transformation and Service Delivery

[[Challenges and opportunities in public sector digital transformation | Investing in skills and capabilities]] facilitates:
*   **Faster reaction times:** Government can respond more quickly to emerging challenges with a digitally skilled workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Consistent service quality:** Ensuring consistent quality of services across all channels, regardless of whether they are digital or physical, is a key objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
*   **User-centered design:** Services must be designed with users in mind, focusing on usability and utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Seamless journeys:** Good services support multiple channels, allowing users to switch between them throughout their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Silos:** Enhancing skills and promoting collaboration helps connect different silos within public sector organizations, leading to more joined-up services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.
*   **Building Trust:** By ensuring inclusivity, transparency, and effective service delivery, governments can foster greater trust in public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

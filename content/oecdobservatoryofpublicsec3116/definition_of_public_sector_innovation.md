Defining [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] in general can be challenging, as it relates to novelty and concepts that did not previously exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While the private sector has a more established understanding of innovation, the definition becomes more complex within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Private Sector Innovation vs. Public Sector Innovation

In the private sector, [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation]] is defined as something new and implemented within a market context, providing a firm with a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This can manifest as a new service, process, product, or any new thinking applied to achieve a direct market proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

However, defining [[public_sector_innovation | innovation in the public sector]] is more complicated because it lacks the feedback system of a market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Key Characteristics of Public Sector Innovation

[[public_sector_innovation | Public sector innovation]] should be understood through several key aspects:

*   **Novelty to Context**
    [[public_sector_innovation | Public sector innovation]] is not merely about introducing entirely new things, but rather about introducing things that are new to a specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This includes new thinking, services, or other forms of novelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

*   **Implementation and Impact**
    A crucial element is implementation; it's not about inventions or ideas that have been discussed, but about actually implemented and applied new thinking, services, or processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. These must have had an actual impact within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

*   **Contribution to Public Value**
    Unlike the private sector's focus on competitive advantage (which is not applicable as the government is often the sole player), [[public_sector_innovation_definition_and_significance | public sector innovation]] is about contributing to a change in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It introduces new elements that contribute to this value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

*   **Potential for Both Positive and Negative Outcomes**
    The impact of [[innovation_in_the_public_sector | innovation in the public sector]] does not have to be exclusively positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For example, digital advancements that provide quicker services might inadvertently exclude parts of the population without access to digital tools or the capability to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Therefore, [[innovation_in_public_sector | innovation]] can have both beneficial and detrimental effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

In summary, [[public_sector_innovation_introduction | public sector innovation]] typically refers to new things that are implemented in a new context, aiming to bring some form of value to the population that utilizes them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

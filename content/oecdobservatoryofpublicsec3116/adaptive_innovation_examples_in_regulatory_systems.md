[[adaptive_innovation|Adaptive innovation]] centers on the discovery process itself, rather than having clear, pre-defined goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It involves exploring new ideas and discovering what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This approach is crucial for new ideas to emerge, especially when existing systems or paradigms might limit thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. [[adaptive_innovation|Adaptive innovation]] focuses on exploring new ideas "on the ground" that could become useful for current government services or even challenge existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

For [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]] to flourish, individuals need allowance and room from a bottom-up perspective to explore new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. People working closest to citizens can draw upon signals from their lives, innovating or experimenting based on feedback from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This can lead to transformative changes or enhancement-oriented innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Canadian Example: Making Regulation Understandable

[[examples_of_innovation_types_in_action|Different adaptive innovations]] have emerged in various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. In Canada, for instance, individuals have developed applications "by the side of their desk" to make the regulatory system more easily absorbable for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

These apps aim to simplify the understanding of regulatory requirements, such as what regulations apply when establishing a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This approach shifts the focus from merely having too much regulation to making it understandable and usable for the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The problem is no longer about simplifying regulation, but about ensuring it is comprehensible and actionable for the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This specific initiative is a direct result of [[adaptive_innovation|adaptive innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

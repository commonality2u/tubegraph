[[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | Strategic foresight]] is defined by the OECD as "the ability to constantly perceive, make sense of and act on the future in the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Its primary purpose is not to predict the future, but to enable better decision-making today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This includes stress-testing innovative solutions and future-proofing current actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It provides a structured, participatory, inclusive, impactful, and systemic approach to looking at future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, helping to identify challenges and opportunities, invest in innovative solutions, and build shared visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## The Flanders Blueprint for Strategic Foresight

The OECD has collaborated with the Government of Flanders to develop a blueprint for [[integrating_strategic_foresight_into_government_organizations | integrating strategic foresight into government organizations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This work involved an initial assessment of the Flemish government's strategic foresight system, followed by the creation of a multi-level blueprint for embedding foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

The blueprint and the related work in Flanders highlight four key functions for foresight practice, developed in collaboration with the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>:

*   **Discover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>: Involves trend and weak signal analysis, requiring time and skilled personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Explore** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>: Making sense of insights from discovery through horizon scanning, pattern analysis, and engaging with the science community via science-to-policy dialogues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Map** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>: Connecting intelligence with current policymaking by mapping opportunities and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This includes building [[future_scenarios_and_strategic_foresight | explorative scenarios]] and using resilience indicators to understand future potential and weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Create** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>: Focusing on impact and scale by creating visions and roadmaps, and building coalitions for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## Challenges in Foresight Implementation

Integrating strategic foresight into organizations, especially government systems, presents several challenges identified through experience and feedback:

*   **Time and Workload** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>: Lack of dedicated time for discovery and engagement in foresight activities, particularly in times of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Silos and Overwhelm** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>: Difficulty in crossing different policy domains and actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Budget and Resources** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>: Financial constraints for foresight initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
*   **Short-term Thinking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>: Governments often focus on immediate crises, making it hard to invest in anticipatory intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Lack of Understanding/Buy-in** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>: Difficulties in convincing policymakers of the value of foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, leading to a perception of foresight as just a set of tools or an extra administrative step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.
*   **Impact Gap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>: Bridging the gap between foresight activities and core government processes like policy-making, budgeting, and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
*   **Fragmented Projects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>: Foresight often operates on a project basis, making it difficult to establish a structural mandate for continuous foresight work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

## Solutions and Enabling Factors

Successfully [[strategic_foresight_and_its_challenges_in_implementation | implementing strategic foresight]] requires a multifaceted approach:

### Institutionalizing Foresight
*   **Legal Frameworks**: Wales has a unique approach where foresight work stems from the Well-being of Future Generations Act (2015), creating a legal duty on ministers to publish a future trends report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Approach**: Rather than focusing on one "super team," it's crucial to build a healthy foresight ecosystem that considers sociocultural and governmental contexts, capabilities, processes, structures, and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
*   **Embedding in Policy Cycles**: Integrate foresight into everyday policy cycles, informing strategic decision-making, budgeting, performance management, and leading to more impactful innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

### Tailoring Foresight Products and Communication
*   **Audience-Specific Products**: Curate foresight products for different audiences, using visuals, graphs, figures, or stories to persuade various stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Insights**: Combine foresight methods with traditional analysis to provide numbers and hypothetical simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. Quantifying potential budgetary impacts can be particularly instrumental in gaining political interest and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>.
*   **Proactive Media Engagement**: Utilize media proactively to amplify foresight messages and insights, influencing both parliament members and ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

### [[the_role_of_partnerships_and_networks_in_foresight_practices | Leveraging Networks and Partnerships]]
*   **Cross-Boundary Collaboration**: Foresight by definition involves crossing boundaries of time, policy domains, and actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Diverse Partners**: Work with Academia, EU institutions, other governments (e.g., Flanders and OECD, Wales and Nesta, Finland's diverse network of research centers, ministries, and innovation labs) to pool resources and gain diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Foresight Hubs**: Develop initiatives like the Wales Futures Hub to bring together officials with expertise across various public services, fostering collaborative work and constructive challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.

### Building Internal Capacity and Training
*   **Learn by Doing**: Encourage hands-on learning, starting with small groups willing to contribute and build skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.
*   **Empowering Colleagues**: Provide tools and methods to empower colleagues to explore foresight for themselves, rather than foresight teams doing all the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.
*   **Exposure to New Ideas**: Bring in external experts, organize discovery months, and offer residencies to expose staff to new ideas and challenge assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>.
*   **Space for Exploration**: Design programs that give staff time and resources for experimental and self-directed work, such as sabbaticals or "Exploration Week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>.

### Focus on [[role_of_strategic_foresight_in_anticipatory_innovation | Transformative Innovation]]
*   **Strategic Foresight for Innovation**: Foresight should inform [[role_of_strategic_foresight_and_experimentation | anticipatory innovation]] and mission development, helping organizations anticipate changes in technology and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.
*   **Prototyping and Speculating**: Use foresight to explore possibilities and create prototypes of future solutions (e.g., generative AI in education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>.

### Measuring Impact
*   **Tracking Message Spread**: While there are no single "right" metrics, impact can be measured by how widely foresight messages spread among policy designers and in public discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.
*   **Thresholds and Milestones**: Set clear thresholds or milestones, such as key policy figures realizing an issue and needing to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:13">[01:22:13]</a>.
*   **Milestones for Long-term Strategies**: For longer-term strategies, establish sensible interim milestones and engage in regular discussions within governance structures to track progress and maintain accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.

By addressing these challenges and implementing these solutions, organizations can effectively embed [[understanding_and_utilizing_strategic_foresight | strategic foresight]] to make better, more resilient decisions for the future.

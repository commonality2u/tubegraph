[[Anticipatory innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] is a key facet of public sector innovation, yet it tends to be systematically under-invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>. The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) aims to build capacity in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:47">[02:11:47]</a>. While anticipating and innovating are important, it is also crucial to establish mechanisms and structures within governments to ensure this work can happen sustainably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This concept is referred to as [[Anticipatory Innovation Governance | anticipatory innovation governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:48">[02:20:48]</a>.

## Barriers to Getting Started
Several barriers impede the effective implementation of [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]] and [[Anticipatory innovation and foresight | strategic foresight]], leading to an "impact gap" where excellent foresight work fails to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>:

*   **Competency Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:25">[03:36:25]</a>: The practice of [[Anticipatory innovation and foresight | strategic foresight]] is not universally embedded across governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:58">[03:46:58]</a>.
*   **Cultural Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:48">[03:57:48]</a>: Unreasonable expectations that foresight will reveal the future like an oracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:30">[03:58:30]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>: Humans struggle with complexity, uncertainty, and exponential change, leading to avoidance of uncertainty, groupthink, recency/availability bias, and a lack of imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:40">[04:05:40]</a>.
*   **Corporate Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>: Organizations may cling to "zombie futures" â€“ implicit assumptions about the future that are no longer relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:48">[04:10:48]</a>.
*   **Communication Barriers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>: Different perceptions of the future within an organization, leading to a lack of shared narratives or constructive disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:50">[04:18:50]</a>.

In Chile, for instance, less than 20% of public funding for science, knowledge, technology, and innovation is invested in facing the future in an organized way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:20">[04:51:20]</a>. This signals a lack of political agreement and funding for such initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## The Role of Values and Politicians
Incorporating values explicitly into the [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]] process, especially when dealing with high uncertainty and long-term future impacts, presents a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.

### Political Engagement
Leni Crow Jefferson from Denmark highlights the need to ask: "Where are the politicians in this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:04">[03:10:04]</a>. She argues that discussing "desired futures" ventures into the "value domain" of politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:48">[03:14:48]</a>. This raises questions about how politicians become engaged and what their roles are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:34">[03:37:34]</a>.

In Slovenia, despite the urgency of demographic changes and the need for future-oriented talent management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:57">[03:29:57]</a>, engagement with leadership and politicians is a step-by-step, bottom-up process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. The challenge is that politicians often desire quick results, and it's difficult to make agreements on intangible solutions or allocate funds for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:50">[04:52:50]</a>.

Damian Aransa Ransibia from Chile observes that everyone in public administration is a political actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. He emphasizes the need for society, with politicians' help, to agree on which future scenarios are considered opportunities and which are risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.

### Addressing the Disconnect
The tension between short political cycles (three to five years) and the much longer timescales of problems that [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]] seeks to address is a core issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:49">[01:06:49]</a>.

One approach is to offer future scenarios as a public good, allowing politicians, the productive sector, and academia to respond based on their own values and perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>. This open innovation approach encourages a less linear way of thinking about the future, moving beyond the dominance of economic disciplines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.

Yelena Tobakkovic notes that while solutions may be known (data, collaboration), decisions are not always made, sometimes due to politicians avoiding transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. This highlights the need for civil servants to be "stubborn" in implementing and proving the value of new approaches to foster a new culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>.

## Features of a Supportive Toolkit
A [[Toolkit for Anticipatory Innovation | toolkit for anticipatory innovation]], such as the one being developed by Portugal and OPSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>, needs to consider specific features to improve its utility:

*   **User-Centric Design** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>: It must be relevant to the users, engaging them in its development to ensure it addresses their actual problems and adds value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.
*   **Tangibility and Concreteness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>: Foresight work can be too abstract; the toolkit must help translate concepts into actionable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Modularity and Adaptability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>: It should be a modular solution that can be upgraded, adapted, and complemented to fit different contexts and needs, rather than a prescriptive recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.
*   **Focus on Skills Development** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>: The toolkit should socialize skills like imagination, boldness, and prospection, which are critical for the future of public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>.
*   **Questioning Framework**: The toolkit should act as a platform for asking questions, not just providing answers, starting a process of continuous learning and self-questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

## Long-Term Vision
[[Anticipatory innovation | Anticipatory innovation]] and [[Anticipatory innovation and foresight | strategic foresight]] require sustained, long-term effort to bear fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>. It is unreasonable to expect a breakthrough from a single exercise or toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>. The goal is to move beyond mere information gathering and pondering to purposeful sense-making, strategic reframing, and generating ideas for concrete innovation and experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

Ultimately, the function of a toolkit in [[Anticipatory innovation | anticipatory innovation]] is not to make us believe in magical future creatures, but to instill the belief that if unexpected challenges arise, we have the tools and capacity to address them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. It is about empowering individuals and organizations to explore the future and learn from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.

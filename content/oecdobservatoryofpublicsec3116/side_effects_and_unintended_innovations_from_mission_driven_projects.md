[[Missionoriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is defined by a clear purpose for why innovation is needed, aiming to solve a specific challenge or problem in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While the primary goal is direct problem-solving, this approach often yields significant side effects in the form of unintended, beneficial innovations.

## Emergent Innovations from Clear Goals

A notable characteristic of [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] is its ability to foster new ideas that emerge connected to the primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. These emergent ideas can prove beneficial in the future, even if not directly part of the initial objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The Moonshot Example

One of the most widely recognized examples of [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] is the [[moon_landing_as_an_example_of_mission_oriented_innovation | moonshot]] program, which had the explicit goal of reaching the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. NASA, for instance, aligned its entire system to fulfill this singular mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

While substantial innovation occurred directly because of the moonshot, many different types of innovations also emerged as a "side effect" of this [[missionoriented_innovation | mission-oriented innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Despite these emergent benefits, the ultimate goal of the moonshot was binary: either successfully touching the ground on the moon or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

[[Missionoriented_innovation | Mission-oriented innovation]] is fundamentally about purpose-driven innovation, with clear goals underpinning the reason for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

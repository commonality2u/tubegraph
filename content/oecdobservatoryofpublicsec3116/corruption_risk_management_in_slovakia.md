Slovakia has been actively engaged with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in a multi-year project aimed at enhancing capacities within its public administration to bolster integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This collaborative effort focuses on reinforcing a robust integrity system, a key component of which is the implementation of effective [[strategies_for_enhancing_public_sector_integrity | corruption risk management]].

## Project Context and Objectives

The project, conducted over four years, involved various Slovak institutions, notably the Anti-Corruption Prevention Department and the Government Office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. It encompassed analytical work and direct engagement with civil servants to improve their ability to implement integrity measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Key areas of focus included:
*   Integrating a strategic approach to inform integrity policies, particularly within the framework of the former National Anti-Corruption Policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   Enhancing horizontal coordination across integrity functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   Engaging a "whole-of-society" approach to ensure fit-for-purpose integrity reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   Applying a [[behavioral_insights_in_public_integrity | behavioral risk-based approach]] to corruption prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

This behavioral risk-based approach is crucial as it helps identify and mitigate the most prevalent risks, making corruption prevention more effective and strengthening the accountability of civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

### Insights from the 2022 Integrity Review

The "Integrity Review of the Slovak Republic," published in 2022, provided a comprehensive 360-degree view of Slovakia's integrity system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. A significant finding was that while Slovakia had established measures and methodological guidelines for corruption risk management, their practical application was lagging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. This challenge is not unique to Slovakia, as similar issues are observed in many OECD countries, where frameworks are in place but consistent and coherent application struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

Slovakia's interest in exploring innovative ways to improve corruption risk management, particularly through [[behavioral_insights_in_public_integrity | behavioral insights]], is seen as inspiring for other countries facing similar challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

## OECD Recommendations and Behavioral Insights

The work is grounded in the OECD Recommendation on Public Integrity, launched in 2017, which advocates for a sustainable and strategic approach to fighting corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This recommendation shifts focus from ad-hoc policies to a context-dependent, behavioral risk-based approach, and emphasizes cultivating a culture of integrity across the entire society, including public servants, businesses, civil society organizations, and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

[[behavioral_insights_in_public_integrity | Behavioral insights]] are crucial for anti-corruption and integrity measures in two main areas:
1.  **Supporting Ethical Choices:** Most people possess a moral compass and strive to act with integrity. However, they may rationalize unethical actions while still perceiving themselves as honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. Traditional measures often target "corrupt" individuals, but a behavioral approach emphasizes empowering the majority of public officials who wish to act correctly by creating an environment that supports ethical choices and open discussion of ethical concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
2.  **Ensuring Effective Implementation of Integrity Policies:** Policies, even well-intentioned ones, may not achieve desired impacts or can even backfire if the real behaviors and consequences of public officials are not considered during implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. This applies to areas like corruption risk management, internal and external audits, conflict of interest management, and integrity communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

## The Experiment: Preventing Corruption in Slovak Public Administration

A key aspect of the project was an experiment designed to answer how to prevent corruption in the Slovak public administration, specifically by empowering public sector employees to detect corruption risks and feel safe reporting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

### Methodology: The BASIC Framework

The experiment followed the OECD's BASIC framework for applied behavioral insights:
*   **Behavior:** Understanding the target behavior (employees speaking up about corruption risks) and whether [[behavioral_insights_in_public_integrity | behavioral science]] is a suitable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.
*   **Analysis:** Diagnosing why the behavior occurs, including context and social norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Identifying behavioral strategies to counter identified biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>.
*   **Intervention:** Empirically testing interventions to learn what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>.
*   **Change:** Scaling up successful interventions to create lasting change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.

### Targeted Behaviors and Drivers

Through interviews and focus groups with anti-corruption coordinators and public officials, several behaviors were identified that hindered corruption prevention:
*   Managers displaying "ticking the box" behavior, formally complying but not acting in line with the code of conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
*   Misreporting progress related to the National Recovery and Resilience Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>.
*   Managers not encouraging the use of an electronic survey for reporting corruption risks, leading to underutilization by employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>.
*   A pervasive "culture of fear" or "culture of silence" preventing employees from speaking up about potential corruption risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>.

The experiment specifically focused on the last point: encouraging employees to speak up about *potential* corruption risks, not just incidents, as this allows for early detection and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>.

Drivers for not speaking up included:
*   Lack of good examples from leaders/managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.
*   Limited understanding of existing reporting channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.
*   Psychological costs, particularly the perception of retaliation and lack of anonymity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>.
*   Absence of a feedback mechanism to confirm that reported risks are being addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.

### Experiment Design

The randomized vignette experiment targeted two specific barriers: a lack of understanding of what constitutes a reportable risk (potential vs. actual incident) and the lack of good examples from leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>.

*   **Population:** 2,537 public officials from Slovak line Ministries and central authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:00">[30:28:00]</a>.
*   **Vignette:** Participants were presented with a hypothetical scenario where they suspected a lack of control measures in hiring procedures, potentially leading to conflicts of interest or lack of transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a>.
*   **Interventions:**
    *   **Treatment 1 (Understanding of Risk):** A message using a health analogy (reporting smoking risks to a doctor) to explain the importance of communicating potential corruption risks to minimize future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57:00">[27:57:00]</a>.
    *   **Treatment 2 (Exemplary Leadership):** A message asking participants to imagine their manager actively raising hiring risks and encouraging colleagues to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:47:00">[28:47:00]</a>.
*   Both messages also included an injunctive social norm, reminding that "every civil servant should be honest and speak about corruption risks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>.
*   To encourage participation, a lottery offering a 15-minute chat with the Prime Minister was included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:58:00">[29:58:00]</a>.

### Key Findings

*   In the control group (no intervention), only 48% of respondents were likely to communicate the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47:00">[31:47:00]</a>.
*   **Leadership Message Impact:** Employees who received the leadership message were approximately 14 percentage points more likely to communicate a risk compared to the control group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:00">[33:27:00]</a>. This was the most impactful message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39:00">[33:39:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding of Risk Message Impact:** Employees who received the understanding of risk message were approximately 9 percentage points more likely to communicate a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[33:42:00]</a>.
*   **Impact of Age:** Younger respondents were significantly more likely to communicate a corruption risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>. An increase in age by one year decreased the likelihood to communicate an integrity risk by 0.23 percentage points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:00">[34:27:00]</a>. This may be due to a greater fear of retaliation among senior officials and a "status quo bias" from longer exposure to existing practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.
*   **Feeling of Safety:** Both treatments slightly increased the feeling of safety among respondents (around 3 percentage points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31:00">[35:31:00]</a>. People generally felt safer when asked who they would like to report to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:00">[03:55:00]</a>. A majority preferred communicating risks to their managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>.
*   **Trust in System:** People who [[citizen_trust_and_its_impact_on_governance | trust]] the risk management system were more likely to feel safe and communicate corruption risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:01:00">[37:01:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding of Risk Definition:** Only 30.8% of respondents correctly identified the vignette situation as a corruption *risk* (as opposed to an incident or no communication) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>. The treatments did not significantly improve this understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:02:00">[38:02:00]</a>.

## Recommendations for Slovakia

Based on these findings, the OECD offers three key recommendations for Slovakia's new National Anti-Corruption Strategy (2024-2029):

1.  **Empower Leaders to Set the Standard:** Given the significant impact of the leadership message, it's vital to empower leaders through training, equipping them with the knowledge, skills, and resources to lead by example and act with integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:28:00">[39:28:00]</a>. Cross-agency cooperation among anti-corruption coordinators can help redefine and develop guidelines for the code of conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>.
2.  **Make Risk Communication Easy and Understood:** Policies should align with how people prefer to behave, for instance, by making it clear that reporting to managers is a safe and valid option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>. Raising awareness of existing reporting channels (e.g., electronic surveys) and implementing clear, concise, and behaviorally informed guidelines is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:59:00">[40:59:00]</a>.
3.  **Cultivate a Culture of Safety and Social Norms:** Feelings of safety are a key enabler for people to speak up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>. It is important to cultivate an open culture of integrity where public officials feel comfortable discussing ethical concerns and choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. This reinforces the idea that reporting risks is a social norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:48:00">[41:48:00]</a>.

This study is viewed as an ambitious and significant first step, providing concrete lines of action for Slovakia and serving as a model for other countries tackling similar complex issues of public integrity and corruption prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>. Future work will aim to scale up these findings and test interventions in real-world settings across multiple public administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.

[[public_sector_innovation | Public sector innovation]] is defined as something novel in its context that is implemented and brings about a shift in public value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. An innovation can vary in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, and its development process can be more or less certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It can emerge through directed top-down initiatives or from bottom-up, undirected efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Given the multifaceted nature of [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation developed a model to help make sense of its various aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## OECD Public Sector Innovation Model

The OECD's model for [[public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation]] is built upon two core features of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:
*   How directed it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   How uncertain the process is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>

From these two axes, four distinct [[types_of_public_sector_innovation | facets of innovation]] emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:

### 1. Enhancement-Oriented Innovation
This facet focuses on making existing products, services, and processes more effective and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Example**: Using behavioral insights to encourage timely tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### 2. Mission-Oriented Innovation
Mission-oriented innovation aims to solve specific problems and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Historical efforts like sending humans to the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, or contemporary initiatives such as transitioning to sustainable energy to combat climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### 3. Anticipatory Innovation
This type of innovation seeks to influence future developments before they become fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Example**: Exploring the ethical and technological boundaries that artificial intelligence projects should adhere to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### 4. Adaptive Innovation
Adaptive innovation is an exploration of what is possible, a process of discovering what could be or might be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Example**: The emergence of social media introduced new ways for government and citizens to interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, reshaping citizen expectations and creating new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Balanced Innovation Portfolio

Since [[public_sector_innovation | innovation]] is multifaceted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, there is no single "one-size-fits-all" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Concentrating on only one or two facets can lead to uneven innovation efforts and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Therefore, government needs a balanced innovation portfolio that covers all innovation facets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

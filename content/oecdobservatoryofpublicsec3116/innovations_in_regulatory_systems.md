[[Government innovation and adaptation | Adaptive innovation]] is a crucial discovery process within regulatory systems that focuses on exploring new ideas without clear predefined goals, with the aim of discovering what is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This approach is essential for the emergence of entirely new ideas, moving beyond the confines of existing paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Nature of Adaptive Innovation

[[Government innovation and adaptation | Adaptive innovation]] involves exploring new ideas on the ground that could either enhance current government services or challenge existing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It necessitates providing individuals with the autonomy and space for bottom-up exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Individuals working closely with citizens can leverage signals from their lives to guide their [[innovation in government | innovation]] efforts, conducting tests and experiments based on direct feedback from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

This type of [[innovation in government | innovation]] can lead to transformative changes or contribute to enhancement-oriented improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Both types of outcomes are considered vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Examples of Adaptive Innovation

Different instances of [[Government innovation and adaptation | adaptive innovation]] have emerged in various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. For example, in Canada, individuals have developed applications alongside their regular duties to make the regulatory system more accessible and understandable for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

These [[Technological advancements in governance | apps]] aim to simplify understanding, for instance, which regulations apply when establishing a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This shifts the focus from merely having extensive regulation to ensuring it is comprehensible and usable for the end-user or client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

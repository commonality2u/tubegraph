The year 2020, marked by the [[challenges_and_responses_during_the_covid19_pandemic | COVID-19 crisis]], has served as a profound global experiment, providing significant [[lessons_learned_from_the_covid19_pandemic_for_future_governance_strategies | lessons for future governance strategies]] and spurring a new impetus for [[public_sector_innovation_in_response_to_covid19 | innovation practice]] around the world [00:00:32]. This period has highlighted the need to identify what changes to retain and what to discard [00:03:33].

## Key Learnings and Observations

### The Imperative of Deep Listening
A primary lesson from the pandemic is the global struggle to deeply or "radically" listen [00:07:41]. Decision-making has often been based on an outdated notion that governments possess all the answers, a fallacy now unraveling [00:07:54]. Participative democracy is still immature, with limited spaces for collaboration, leading to power being quickly assumed by a few [00:08:17]. Governments have made incorrect assumptions about how people live, causing damage through lack of understanding of impacts on care homes, schools, and jobs [00:08:34]. Systems have shown a lack of empathy and compassion, not being optimized for learning [00:08:48]. In some contexts, governments have asked citizens to trust systems that have historically treated people unequally [00:09:04].

When listening is done well, trust can grow, relationships flourish, and positive outcomes can emerge even from difficult circumstances [00:09:14]. While there isn't a single prescription for listening, enabling it in any form helps build collaboration into the DNA and culture of governance [00:09:39]. Through "radical listening," some communities have created spaces to be heard, leading to faster, better feedback loops [00:09:50]. This has allowed previously marginalized voices to gain a seat at the government table [00:10:02]. Listening must be for learning, not for blame, with a fundamental principle that no decision about people should be made without people [00:10:28]. People are experts in their own lives and know what they need, but often feel unable to act [01:04:48]. The new role of government should be to enable places of listening, learning, and collaboration to grow, sharing power rather than giving it up [01:11:11].

### Leveraging Existing Infrastructure and Trust
In an emergency like the pandemic, governments must work with what they have [00:13:07]. Countries that had made prior investments in basic and fundamental infrastructure possessed more options for improvisation and [[public_sector_innovation_in_response_to_covid19 | innovation]] [00:13:14]. Examples include:
*   Asian countries responding effectively on the health side, building on SARS protocols [00:13:43].
*   African countries performing remarkably well, some building on Ebola protocols [00:13:55].
*   Countries with existing basic social safety nets finding it easier to stretch their limits, compared to those reliant on external aid [00:14:30].
*   Physical infrastructure being repurposed, such as India converting 100,000 railway cars into ambulances [00:14:55].

Where social capital and trust were high, new opportunities for collaboration were unlocked, such as public-private partnerships in Korea or low-cost testing development through research center and state collaboration in Vietnam [00:15:14]. The pandemic has exposed how low trust and poor basic infrastructure exacerbate existing issues [00:15:57]. A simple indicator of whether governments will revert to old ways is if they return to requiring multiple letters for inter-ministerial meetings, a practice shown absurd by the crisis [00:31:02].

### Accelerated Policy Shifts and the Overton Window
The pandemic represents one of the largest natural comparative public policy experiments in nearly 90 years, with the virus being a constant factor across diverse responses [00:24:04]. There was no existing playbook for this crisis [00:24:36]. Many policy options that would have been deemed unacceptable or heretical before the pandemic have been broadly tolerated, if not welcomed, by the public [00:25:00]. These include social distancing, free childcare, mobile apps with privacy concerns, Universal Basic Income, and labor market subsidies [00:25:20]. This indicates a fluid social contract and the exercise of new muscles in the relationship between citizens and the state [00:25:50].

### Evolution of Public Sector and Policymaking
The crisis has accelerated existing debates about public services and policymaking [00:19:10].
*   **Policymaking:** Traditional policymaking, particularly at the national level, has suffered from being too scattergun in influencing complex systems and being too path-dependent, lacking agility and learning capacity [00:19:32]. The crisis, however, has demonstrated that policies can be made and enacted much more quickly than previously thought possible [00:20:05]. This could accelerate a shift towards a mindset of "thinking like a system, acting like an entrepreneur" [00:20:21].
*   **Public Services:** The "massive global failed experiment" of new public management, while functionally "dead," still persisted due to a lack of clear alternatives [00:20:39]. The pandemic reveals two key imperatives for future public services:
    1.  **Technocratic:** A significant increase in digital public services, improved analytical skills, and a recognition of the importance of targeting and preemptive systems [00:21:12].
    2.  **Relational:** The inadequacy of a transactional model of public services and the importance of moving towards a relational model, where public services are seen as the outcome of collaboration between the state, citizens, and communities [00:21:43]. The future challenge is whether these two imperatives can be combined to create a new public service model [00:22:25].

### Challenges to Sustainable Change
Despite the rapid changes, skepticism remains about whether deep-seated incentive structures in politics and government will truly shift [00:45:30]. Some worry that the innovations seen during the period of fear and anxiety might be superficial and revert once a vaccine allows a return to "normal" [00:51:50].

However, some undeniable truths may force continued change:
*   **Complexity:** Living in complex times with no simple answers to persistent, intricate problems [00:52:41]. Old methods will likely fail for these increasingly complex issues [00:53:06].
*   **Poverty and Inequality:** The pandemic has exposed many, including those who previously considered themselves prosperous, to the experience of poverty and fear for their futures [00:53:30]. This widespread experience of vulnerability is an undeniable fact that may force different thinking [00:53:52]. The Black Lives Matter movement also highlighted deep issues of injustice and inequality, further prompting calls for change [00:38:18].
*   **Public Finance Orthodoxies:** The crisis revealed that artificial constraints existed on public spending, as hundreds of billions of dollars were quickly "found" when needed [00:54:13]. This realization that spending choices are strategic rather than purely budgetary might lead to new public demands, such as questioning why healthcare services are underfunded when significant funds can be mobilized [00:55:00]. This could be a "liberating realization" but also challenging to existing political settlements [00:55:58].

### Unleashing Talent and Leadership
The pandemic has prompted shifts in organizational dynamics and leadership:
*   **Hierarchy Subversion:** Organizations have had to work in flatter ways, with many elaborate systems falling by the wayside without hindering effectiveness [00:59:32]. This has been liberating, but the balance between flat organization and the need for leaders to make tough decisions post-crisis remains a key question [01:00:02].
*   **Improvisation:** The crisis has elevated the importance of improvisation, propelling individuals from lower ranks to crucial tasks where their unique skills were suddenly indispensable [01:00:56]. The challenge is whether this newfound talent will be capitalized upon or disappear after the crisis [01:01:20].
*   **Reflection and Humility:** Many leaders and civil servants have experienced a heightened sense of reflectivity, reconnecting with the core reasons they joined public service [01:01:39]. The personal impact of the disease has reduced the distance between planners/service delivery and the people they serve, fostering a sense of humility [01:01:51].
*   **Exhaustion:** There is also a widespread sense of exhaustion across all levels of government, which may lead to a new understanding of well-being conditions in the public sector [01:02:15].
*   **Leadership Evolution:** Workforces are calling for leaders to move beyond "doing things" to "being something," emphasizing values, behaviors, and relationships over processes [01:04:08]. This involves inspiring younger generations entering public service and creating safe learning environments for experimentation [01:05:18]. Public service needs to remain attractive and supportive to recruit and retain talent [01:06:39].

## Advice for International Institutions and Personal Reflections

### Guidance for the OECD
The OECD, as a major institution, should focus less on producing "content" (reports, papers) and more on fostering "relationships" [01:09:05]. The world has an abundance of content; what is needed is investment in enabling people to connect, strengthen networks, and build "cement" between the "bricks" of information [01:09:13]. The OECD should use its influence to advocate for "next generation governance," shifting away from "zombie orthodoxies" like outdated public management models and public finance constraints that are "well past their prime" [01:10:36]. It should champion new paradigms such as universal healthcare and universal basic income, as the crisis has shown that fundamental investments in capacity and infrastructure are crucial [01:14:00].

### Personal Learnings from the Pandemic
Individuals involved in public service and governance have learned significant lessons:
*   The British context, while challenging, shows potential for global shifts, particularly in climate change initiatives, which could serve as a broader narrative wrapper for other changes [01:08:11].
*   A personal realization is the importance of "listen, learn, and adapt" as core principles for navigating this and future periods of change [01:15:55].
*   Communities, often deemed "hard to reach," are in fact "seldom heard" and can be the biggest advocates for recovery and rebuilding if engaged [01:16:09].
*   From an innovation perspective, it has been humbling and useful to document the "innovation dividend" emerging during the crisis, providing valuable insights for those in the trenches and for future reflection [01:14:20].
*   The Buddhist concept of *anicca* (impermanence), meaning everything is constantly changing, provides a framework for maintaining equanimity during crisis – not becoming overly excited by positive news like a vaccine, nor overly depressed by tragic events, but continuing to move forward [01:11:52]. As an author once wrote, "write every day without hope, without despair" [01:12:51].

History presents "plastic hours"—crucial moments when timely action can make a difference, transforming a rigid social order into a pliable one [01:16:43]. These rare moments, often triggered by crises, depend on the alignment of public opinion, political power, events, social mobilization, and leadership, and can be easily "unnoticed or wasted" [01:17:09]. "Nothing happens unless you move" [01:17:25].

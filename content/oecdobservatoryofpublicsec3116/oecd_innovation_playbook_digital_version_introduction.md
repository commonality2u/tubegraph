The **OECD Innovation Playbook** is a tool developed to translate the [[OECDs Role in Public Sector Innovation | OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation]] into practice, bridging the gap between good intentions and actual implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This tool was co-created by diverse countries to facilitate the application of the Declaration in various contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Development and Purpose

Introduced as an initial demo version, the digital **Innovation Playbook** aims to make the principles of the [[OECDs Role in Public Sector Innovation | OECD Declaration on Public Sector Innovation]] more accessible and actionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The Declaration itself is a high-level instrument providing guidance to governments on how to steer and promote [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Since its creation over five years ago, 43 countries have adhered to the Declaration, underscoring its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The Playbook aims to provide legitimacy and a mandate for [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] efforts in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. It also helps to communicate the messages of the Declaration and offers practical advice on how to apply its principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. For countries like Romania, it introduced the concept of [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | public sector innovation]], which was quite new, helping to raise awareness and bring public servants on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.

### Five Principles of the Declaration
The Declaration, and by extension the Playbook, is built upon five simple principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>:
1.  **Embrace and Nurture Innovation**: Providing high-level sponsorship to encourage and equip all public servants to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This includes ensuring skills and incentives are in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
2.  **Cultivate New Partnerships**: Involving diverse voices beyond government walls, relying on the wisdom and motivation of ecosystem stakeholders, and ensuring inclusivity in [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] creation, implementation, and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
3.  **Support Exploration, Iteration, and Testing**: Testing before implementing, learning from errors, and managing risks in controlled environments using robust methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
4.  **Diffuse Lessons and Share Practices**: Building on the principle that [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] is sharable and built in partnership, and that experiences should be shared to learn from others and improve activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Playbook Journey
The Playbook offers a simple three-step journey to apply these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>:
1.  **Frame the Challenge**: Define the specific problem to be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
2.  **Take Stock**: Assess the current standing, identifying areas of strength and weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
3.  **Use Collective Intelligence**: Utilize use cases, tools, and actions contributed by the Playbook's co-creators to apply, adapt, and adjust solutions to specific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Features and Evolution
The **Innovation Playbook** aims to be accessible, actionable, user-centric, adaptable, and a tool for building connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Co-creation and Iteration
The Playbook was [[International Collaboration on Innovation | co-created]] by 12 countries, starting from a simple Word document mockup and evolving through iterations to include tools and cases based on community suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This iterative process involved testing the final version, with some participants engaging in "Jambo sessions" for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

The development emphasized [[International Collaboration on Innovation | co-creation]] and experimentation, with feedback from countries like Sweden highlighting areas for improvement, leading to a more refined digital version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

### Do-It-Yourself Package
Alongside the Playbook, a "Do It Yourself" package was created to enable broader use and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This package includes:
*   **Tutorial Video**: A 90-second introduction on how to use and apply the Playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Interactive Mural Board**: A digital environment for teams to apply the Playbook collaboratively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **In-person Version**: Materials for conducting traditional workshops, allowing for translation and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Feedback Channel**: A mechanism for users to share experiences, difficulties, and limitations, which has informed areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Real-World Application
Countries have applied the Playbook in various ways:
*   **Sweden**: Jonas Gumbal's team at Vinnova was the first to translate the Playbook into Swedish and develop in-person workshop materials adapted to their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This was driven by insights from prototyping that indicated the need for localized language and a more concise format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **Romania**: Anca Pesco and Larissa Balac from The Innovation Lab in Romania translated the Playbook and used it as a critical tool to build their emerging community of innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. They conducted a massive virtual session with around 800 participants, demonstrating the tool's ability to reach public servants beyond traditional innovation hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. They plan to integrate the digital Playbook into a new platform dedicated to interactions between public servants on [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Chile**: Orlando Hus, director of Laboratorio de Gobierno (Government Lab) in Chile, views the Declaration as a common understanding of [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | public innovation]] and a guide to fostering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. The Government Lab's services, such as agile consultancy (focused on exploration, iteration, and testing) and cultivating partnerships, align with the Declaration's principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. They have a network of over 28,000 public innovators, focusing on capability building and skills development, including a new Public Innovation School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. They also emphasize diffusing lessons and shared practices through their Public Innovation Index, which measures public service capabilities in [[Public Sector Innovation Overview | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

The Playbook is not limited to internal projects but can be applied for dialogues between departments, organizations within a country, and even for cross-border collaboration between different countries, such as Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

## The New Digital Version
The shift to a new digital version of the [[Playbook for business growth | Innovation Playbook]] was driven by the need for an engaging, playful, and interactive tool that allows for cross-linkages, is easily updatable and manageable, and provides automatic, exportable results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. Colleagues from Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Luxembourg, Spain, and Sweden joined to develop this new version, identifying key features and structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.

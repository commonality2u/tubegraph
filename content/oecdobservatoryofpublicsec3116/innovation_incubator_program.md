The Innovation Incubator Program was created by the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) in collaboration with the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Public sector innovation serves as a driving force for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, but sometimes requires additional impetus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Objectives

This incubator program assists countries in exploring more radical innovations and anticipating future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Pilot Phase

During its pilot phase, Denmark, Romania, and Portugal participated in the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Program Support

The incubator offers participating countries a range of support, including:
*   International expert advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   Peer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   Co-design elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

This support aims to enable anticipatory innovation, allowing governments to take future-oriented action and adopt a proactive stance towards societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Portugal's Contribution

Under the program's stewardship, Portugal developed the [[methods_and_tools_in_innovation_toolkits|Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This kit is designed for public servants and managers who are new to anticipatory innovation, aiming to introduce it in an easy-to-understand, assess, and use manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This initiative contributes to [[developing_innovation_proposals|developing innovation proposals]].

### Knowledge Dissemination

Sharing experiences among innovators is crucial for mutual learning and disseminating positive contributions throughout the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. To this end, OPSI has partnered with Accelerate Estonia to help disseminate lessons learned from the Innovation Incubator experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Accelerate Estonia identifies societal problems and facilitates [[publicprivate_partnerships_in_innovation|public private partnership]] to transform these challenges into opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Together, OPSI and Accelerate Estonia have developed [[tools_for_incubating_innovation_projects|tools for incubating innovation projects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. These [[innovation_tools_and_methods|tools and methods]] are accessible to governments on OPSI's website, allowing them to adapt them to their unique contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This also supports [[building_networks_for_innovation|building networks for innovation]] within the [[innovation_ecosystems|innovation ecosystem]].

## OPSI's Broader Role

OPSI functions as the global forum for public sector innovation, dedicated to supporting governments in understanding, testing, and embedding new initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Its overarching goal is to respond to societal challenges, ensuring that improved services and policies contribute to better lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

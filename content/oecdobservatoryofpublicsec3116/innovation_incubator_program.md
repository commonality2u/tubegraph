The [[government_innovation_incubators_and_safe_spaces_for_experimentation | Innovation Incubator Program]] was created by the [[government_innovation_incubators_and_safe_spaces_for_experimentation | Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI)]] in collaboration with the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Its purpose is to assist countries in exploring more radical innovations and anticipating future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, providing a push for public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Pilot Phase

The pilot phase of the program included Denmark, Romania, and Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Program Offerings

The incubator supplies participating countries with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>:
*   International expert advice
*   Peer support
*   Co-design elements

## Focus on Anticipatory Innovation

A core component of the program is [[mission_oriented_innovation | anticipatory innovation]], which enables governments to take future-oriented actions and adopt a proactive stance towards societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit

Under the program's guidance, Portugal developed the [[developing_and_implementing_an_anticipatory_innovation_starter_kit | Anticipatory Innovation Starter Kit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This kit is designed for public service servants and managers new to [[mission_oriented_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Its aim is to introduce [[mission_oriented_innovation | anticipatory innovation]] in a manner that is easy to understand, assess, and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Dissemination of Lessons Learned

Sharing experiences among innovators is vital for mutual learning and disseminating positive contributions across the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. To this end, OPSI has partnered with Accelerate Estonia to help spread the lessons learned from the [[government_innovation_incubators_and_safe_spaces_for_experimentation | Innovation Incubator]] experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Accelerate Estonia works by identifying societal problems and establishing public-private partnerships to transform these problems into opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Tools and Resources

OPSI and Accelerate Estonia have jointly developed tools for incubating innovation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Governments can access these tools on OPSI's website and adapt them to their unique contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

OPSI serves as the global forum for public sector innovation, assisting governments in understanding, testing, and embedding new initiatives to address societal challenges, ultimately contributing to better services, policies, and lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

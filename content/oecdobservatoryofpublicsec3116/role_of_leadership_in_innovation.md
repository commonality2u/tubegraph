Two recent OECD reports, focusing on public sector innovation in Brazil, highlight the critical [[Role of leadership in fostering innovation | role of leadership]] in driving change and enabling a more systemic approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The reports emphasize that while Brazil has a history of innovation, it has often been sporadic and reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, necessitating a deliberate and systemic approach for future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Why Leadership is Crucial for Innovation

Innovation needs to be at the core of government, not just an occasional activity, due to the complex and significant challenges faced globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. In Brazil, innovation is vital to address issues like inequality, financial positions, corruption, and changing demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

Leadership plays a pivotal role in several ways:
*   **Productivity and Efficiency** Brazil's civil service is a significant investment (close to 30% of public expenditure compared to OECD average of 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>. Effective leadership ensures this investment is managed well, supporting and inspiring public servants to utilize their talent for pressing needs like innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. A lack of effective leadership can lead to productivity loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.
*   **Public Trust and Integrity** There's a clear link between the effectiveness of senior civil servants and integrity in the public service, which in turn builds greater public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.
*   **Direct Support for Innovation** Leadership support is consistently identified as one of the most important factors for successful public sector innovation, while its absence is a major barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>. Understanding what kind of leadership fosters innovation is key to evolving public leadership today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.

## Challenges for Leadership in Brazil

Brazil's public sector system is characterized by its legalistic nature, strong emphasis on controls and fighting corruption, and a focus on debureaucratization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. While there's an impressive focus on digital transformation and a growing momentum for innovation, it has not yet been integrated into the public service's main narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Specific challenges include:
*   **Structural Biases against Innovation** The public sector is inherently built to avoid negative feedback and is risk-averse, which does not naturally foster an innovation environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Individual-Driven Innovation** Much of the innovative activity in Brazil is driven by exceptional individual efforts or crises, rather than systemic organizational perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. This reliance on individuals makes innovation vulnerable to burnout or departure, rendering it unsustainable and not systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Lack of Explicit Stewardship** The existing stewardship of the innovation system is often implicit or circumstantial, rather than officially recognized or seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.
*   **Bias Towards Incremental Innovation** The current system structure pushes innovative activity towards more incremental and uncontroversial innovations, despite a need for radical exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.
*   **Rigid Civil Service System** Brazil's civil service system has been described as rigid, not very agile, and structured through many different careers that often work against collective interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.
*   **Lack of Coherence in Senior Positions** There has been little coherence or consistency in managing the types of people put into senior civil servant positions (DAS five and six, or FCPE equivalents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.
*   **Demand Side Challenges** A significant challenge lies in the "demand side" of leadership, where appointment processes are often politically driven and lack transparent, merit-based vetting against clear criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. This requires political buy-in and a willingness from politicians to relinquish some power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.
*   **Personal Risk for Innovators** Civil servants attempting innovation often face legal troubles due to crossing into "gray areas" despite good intentions, exacerbated by unclear job descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

## Key Leadership Qualities and Skills for Innovation

Effective public sector leadership for innovation is highly contextualized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. Leaders need to understand their specific situation and apply the appropriate tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>.

The desired attributes can be grouped into three main skills groups, all built upon a foundation of public service values and ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>:

1.  **Business Skills:** Ability to align resources with needs using various management tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>.
2.  **Innovation Skills:** Leaders don't need to be experts in every technical skill (e.g., data science, iterative processes), but they must understand how these processes are supported and led. They need to ask the right questions, provide appropriate management frameworks, and create space for their teams to innovate professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.
3.  **Mindsets:** These are not tangible skills but crucial orientations:
    *   **Empathy:** Understanding people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
    *   **Empowerment:** Empowering civil servants, innovators, and even citizens to co-create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.
    *   **Continuous Learning:** Understanding its role for themselves and their organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.
    *   **Courage:** Frequently mentioned by innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.
    *   **Digital Understanding:** Comprehending how to organize services and concepts digitally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

A survey of Brazilian civil servants revealed that while they have a strong sense of curiosity, they felt less confident in skills related to iteration and user-centricity (e.g., prototyping, [[behavioral_insights_in_innovation | behavioral insights]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>. Critically, perceptions of management's ability to support these skills were significantly lower than self-assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.

## Building a Systemic Approach to Innovative Leadership

To foster [[Role of leadership in fostering innovation | innovative leadership]], a "supply and demand" model for a senior civil service system is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>.

### Building the Supply of Leaders
This involves defining what leadership is desired, developing leaders to embody those qualities, and reinforcing desired behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.
*   **Unified Vision and Networking:** Unify existing initiatives across Brazil's complex governmental layers and careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>. Developing a shared vision for innovative leadership through better networking is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.
*   **Competency Model:** Develop a unified innovative leadership competency model based on collaborative processes that everyone can buy into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>.
*   **Responsive Training:** Ensure training offers are transparent, effective, and available, aligning them with the developed competency model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.

### Building the Demand for Leaders
This addresses how to ensure leaders are selected and supported to exhibit these desired behaviors.
*   **Merit-Based Hiring Practices:** Implement merit-based hiring practices that assess innovation competencies at senior levels, which have traditionally been politically appointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. A presidential decree establishing minimum criteria for DAS and FCPE positions is a positive starting point, but much more is needed to develop a genuine senior civil service system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Innovation-Oriented Objectives and Performance Assessments:** Integrate innovation into job profiles and performance assessments for senior civil servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:14">[01:03:14]</a>. While [[Definition and challenges of innovation | innovation]] is hard to measure mechanically, reflecting it in job descriptions provides accountability and protection for leaders who undertake innovative endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>.

The recommendation also involves a phased approach, starting with immediate actions, moving to second-stage recommendations, and then longer-term visions that allow for [[challenges_and_strategies_in_implementing_innovation | continuous learning and adaptation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.

## Role of Universities and Open Innovation

*   **Universities:** Public universities play a crucial role in creating the pipeline of civil servants and leaders by teaching relevant skills and presenting the public sector as a valuable career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>. They can also provide insights, generate new solutions, and offer rigor in studying innovation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. Stronger linkages between government and universities are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.
*   **Open Innovation:** Open innovation is a valuable tool that recognizes that answers often come from outside government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>. It can be particularly effective when broad aims are clear, allowing external solutions to be brought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a>. Brazil is experimenting with challenge platforms to promote open innovation and engage external partners like private sector and startups in solving public problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:27">[01:21:27]</a>.

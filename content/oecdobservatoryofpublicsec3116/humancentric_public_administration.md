Humancentric public administration is a crucial approach to governance that emphasizes placing the needs and experiences of citizens at the core of public service design and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This approach aims to improve people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> by ensuring that public services are not merely efficient but also inclusive and transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. A key objective is to "put the public back into public services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

The OECD strongly advocates for this agenda, highlighting that the global trends in government [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]] produced in 2023 focus on public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Governments globally are increasingly adopting a strategic and consistent approach to supporting [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]] in public services by centering on the human element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This necessitates a cultural shift in how bureaucracies operate to truly place citizens at the heart of service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Key Objectives of Humancentric Public Services

The OECD report identifies several objectives for government [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]] related to humancentricity:
*   **Improving efficiency and effectiveness** of public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Increasing public satisfaction** with services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Enhancing service uptake**, especially for populations facing greater challenges in accessing services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Ensuring fairness and equal treatment** in the relationship between governments and citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Building trust** between citizens and governments by providing quality and inclusive services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, and by addressing specific citizen needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Country Approaches and Examples

### Brazil
Brazil views [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]] in public services as a requirement for national development and for improving citizens' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This perspective highlights the state's broader role beyond correcting market failures, contributing to development and value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Brazil's National Digital Government Strategy focuses on promoting [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | digital transformation]] across all states and municipalities to ensure easy access to digital government services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This strategy was developed collaboratively, involving public servants, experts, and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Key initiatives include:
*   **"gobbr" Digital Identity**: Allows 160 million citizens (75% of the Brazilian population) to access over 2,500 digital public services easily, agilely, and transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This was a priority during Brazil's G20 presidency, leading to general principles on digital identity governance in partnership with the OECD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Unified Early Childhood Registry**: Integrates various data sources (social assistance, daycare, school enrollments, vaccines, food security) into a single platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This enables individualized monitoring by child guardians and civil servants, helping create more effective public policies, integrating information, and ensuring quick, personalized access to essential services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Inclusion Initiatives**: Brazil considers gender and race issues in [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### European Union (EU)
The European Commission emphasizes that public administrations must play a key role in shaping a more dynamic and [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovative]] business environment by simplifying procedures, reducing administrative burdens, and creating more [[usercentric_and_omnichannel_approaches_to_public_service_delivery | usercentric public services]] across its 27 member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. The EU aims for a 25% reduction in reporting obligations for companies, potentially saving up to €37 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.

Key aspects include:
*   **"Once-Only Principle"**: Businesses and individuals should only be asked once for information, with administrations managing data exchange internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Full Interoperability**: Requires harmonized standards between public administrations and across countries, ensuring data is machine-readable and semantically/legally operable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This allows governments to optimize operations, anticipate and meet citizen needs, and develop new services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
*   **Digital Government as Continuous Change**: [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | Digital government]] is not a one-time transformation but a continuous change process driven by technologies, requiring system thinking and approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Public Administration**: Prioritizes working with data rather than through documents, allowing data to flow seamlessly between administrative layers and across countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   **Life Event Study**: Focuses on administrative processes like applying for an identity card or registering a business to understand bottlenecks and promote [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovative]] reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.
*   **Innovation Lab in Latvia**: Supported by the EU, this lab consolidated multiple policy labs, ensuring working methods and skills, demonstrating importance for policymaking, service delivery, and [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.

### Canada
Canada focuses on strengthening trust in the public service through improved service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. Building trust leads to improved engagement, better compliance with regulations, and adoption of new [[innovation_in_public_administration | service innovations]] like [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | digitalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

Key approaches:
*   **Service Guarantees**: Implementing a money-back guarantee for passport services if not delivered within a certain timeframe, taking a cue from the private sector to show the government has "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **Digital Standards for Human Centricity**: Canada's digital standards require openness in tool development and invite users to be part of the design, delivery, and implementation of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Reducing Errors in Benefits Systems**: Modernizing old age benefits systems to reduce errors, which ensures essential financial support is not lost and prevents overpayments, thereby building trust and reducing administrative burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.
*   **Ensuring Equitable Access**: Acknowledging unequal access to service across a large country, Canada is building digital infrastructure and promoting digital literacy to ensure all Canadians can access services regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
*   **Life Events and Life Journeys View**: Shifting from a product-based view to designing service interfaces from the client's perspective based on life events (e.g., welcoming a child, retirement, death in the family) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. This bundles services intuitively and aims to integrate services to reduce repeated information requests (the "tell us once" mentality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.
*   **Measuring Pain Points**: Using surveys and instant feedback to understand client pain points and pressures inadvertently created by new digital or policy solutions, enabling iterative correction of problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.
*   **Proactive Service Delivery**: Reimagining existing processes, such as proactive involvement in benefit programs, to leverage new technology and ensure more people automatically access benefits and services without needing to apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.

## Advice for Reformers

Decision-makers looking to implement [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]] in public services and ensure public servants are on board are advised to adopt strategies centered on courage, collaboration, and a clear vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.

Key advice includes:
*   **Build a Culture of [[experimental_approaches_in_public_administration | Experimentation]]**: Create healthy working environments where [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]] can flourish, fostering trust, and encouraging open dialogue and diverse ideas among colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.
*   **Invest in Public Servants**: Recognize public servants as the backbone of [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]] efforts and empower them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.
*   **Collaborate Across Sectors and Borders**: Foster collaboration within different government levels and across national borders to address global challenges with global solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>. Platforms for sharing knowledge and best practices are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.
*   **Prevent Exclusion**: Ensure [[digital_transformation_in_public_administration | digital transformation]] does not exclude citizens lacking digital literacy or skills, by providing accessible support spaces and learning resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.
*   **Strategic Vision for Services**: Develop a strategic vision that looks beyond mere technological adoption to reimagine how services are designed and delivered to meet evolving needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

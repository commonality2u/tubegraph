[[Human Behavior]] is increasingly recognized as a core target for governments and plays an important role in [[addressing climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. The Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 highlighted the significance of sustainable lifestyles and consumption/production patterns in [[addressing climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. By 2021, [[Human Behavior]] was seen as part of the solution for almost any public governance measure linked to [[climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. For the past decade, sustainability has been a top policy area for [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral scientists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## Historical Applications of Behavioral Science

[[behavioral science in environmental policy | Behavioral science]] has contributed to green policies through various successful examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>:
*   **Feedback interventions** to reduce energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **Better labeling of products** to encourage sustainable spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

### Key Success Stories
The Opower example is a well-known success in applying [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science]] to energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
*   **Opower:** This company was founded on research from the 1990s that tested the effectiveness of informing people about their neighbors' energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Opower partnered with energy utilities to send bills comparing individual energy use to that of neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Meta-analyses show that this approach typically results in 2-6% energy reductions, particularly when users consume more than their neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The company now uses sophisticated benchmarks, comparing users to "people like you" (e.g., families of four with two kids, living in similar climates and houses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This technique, known as descriptive norms, is effective for large audiences and has been adopted globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Home Power Savings Program (New South Wales, Australia):** A large program aimed at encouraging low-income households to reduce energy consumption through home visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Initial evaluations showed savings primarily from installed energy-efficient kits (e.g., low-energy light globes, door snakes, low-flow shower heads), but persuasive techniques from assessors were largely ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. [[behavioral science in environmental policy | Behavioral scientists]] were brought in to design a strategy that included intensive behavior change training for assessors, emphasizing tools like commitment devices, limited choice, and social norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This intervention increased energy efficiency by about 4-5% and was scaled across the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. A key change was reducing a six-page list of choices to four or five options, written down and publicly committed to by participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Limitations

Public governance systems require deep and broad transformations to implement urgent green policy measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. However, [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science]] has mainly been used to improve policies already implemented, rather than informing early policy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

### Examples of Limited Success or Failure
*   **Financial Incentives:** Relying solely on the assumption that people will use less energy if they pay less is often ineffective, as people are not always "rational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. For example, even heavily subsidized energy-efficient appliances (80-90% subsidy with no-interest loans) failed to convince low-income households if any debt was involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Energy Meters:** The universal rollout of digital energy meters with the assumption that people would access data, learn, and reduce consumption has largely failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Very few people access their data, and those who do typically stop after one or two times, leading to no sustained engagement or behavior change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **"Quick Win" Nudges:** Early studies that focused on "quick win" nudge-type interventions to induce behavior change, such as sending letters with behaviorally informed messages to encourage heat pump installation, have shown limited success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. While these letters might increase inquiries, they often don't lead to actual installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This indicates that removing only one barrier (e.g., awareness) is insufficient when multiple barriers exist (e.g., financial, logistical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **Small Effect Sizes:** While interventions like social norms can shift the dial, their effect sizes are often small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Promising Pathways and Future Directions for [[Behavioral Science in Environmental Policy]]

There is a growing need to move beyond singular behavioral solutions to systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

### Early Policy Development and Systemic Change
[[behavioral science in environmental policy | Behavioral science]] should be used earlier in the policy process, while environmental policies are being designed, new taxes and regulations are discussed, and stakeholders are consulted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This involves:
*   **Behavior Change as a System Diagnostic:** Analyzing why certain behaviors don't change, even after interventions. If 20% of people change, studying the 80% who don't can reveal systemic drivers or structures that prevent behavior and inform governments about other necessary tools beyond incentives or persuasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   **Garnering Policy Support:** Using [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science]] to "soften the audience" or encourage support for policies *before* they are implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. Research suggests that people performing pro-environmental behaviors are more likely to support related policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. This can be achieved through "spillover" effects, leveraging one behavior to encourage another, ultimately leading to policy support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.
*   **Providing New Types of Tools for Green Policy Proposals:** Especially in designing demand generation programs for new technologies like heat pumps and electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Approaches ("Nudge Plus"):** Combining behavioral insights with more concrete, non-behavioral interventions. This includes using "all the nudges" (defaults, incentives, exclusivity, social norms) alongside addressing financial barriers and other systemic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:33:00">[42:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:00">[43:30:00]</a>.
*   **Tackling All Barriers Simultaneously:** For complex issues like installing new technologies, a multi-pronged approach is needed, tackling all barriers (e.g., awareness, financial, hassle factor, community engagement) together rather than one at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Examples include the "Solarize programs" in the US, which use community group buying schemes for solar panels to achieve discounts and foster collective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### Broader Domains for Behavioral Science
Beyond energy, [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science]] can inform policy in various sectors:
*   **Water Consumption:** Periods of drought create public appetite for behavior change in water use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Biodiversity:** Significant reports (e.g., 2019) showing biodiversity loss, and international agreements like Kunming, create windows for policy action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. For instance, the "Victorian's Value in Nature" policy in Australia aims for every Victorian to connect with and act for nature by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Waste Management:** Policy changes like China's "China Sword" policy reducing tolerance for contaminated recyclables have highlighted the need for behavior change in waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Food Waste Reduction:** Including as many people as possible in efforts to reduce food waste by providing the easiest, hassle-free environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Influence on Identity and Public Mood
Influencing the identity of communities by highlighting past successful actions (e.g., "we're good at saving energy") can increase the likelihood of supporting future green policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This concept of "spillover" suggests that even small, initial commitments can lead to broader support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## [[Innovation and Technology in Climate Mitigation]]

### Carbon Taxes and Financial Incentives
[[behavioral science in environmental policy | Behavioral insights]] can help design financial incentives and disincentives like carbon taxes in a smarter way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   **Climate Bonus:** A concept like a "climate bonus" paid to households at the beginning of the year, framed clearly as being linked to the climate debate, can increase acceptance of carbon taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. This also helps prevent energy poverty and overstretching poorer households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   **Combined Approaches:** Financial incentives, especially for installing greener technology (e.g., UK government offering £5000 to switch gas boilers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, should be combined with [[behavioral science in environmental policy | behavioral science]] to address barriers like limited availability of installers, high costs, and perceived risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

### Addressing Industrial Emissions
While consumers play a role, a large portion of carbon emissions comes from industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Organizational Behavior:** Models of individual behavior (e.g., acting because it's a good thing, feeling pressured, having skills/resources) can explain and predict organizational behavior in adopting green policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
*   **Normative Influence:** Organizations respond strongly to demand and pressure, including seeing rivals adopt policies or pressure from customers opting for greener products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Regulation:** [[behavioral science in environmental policy | Behavioral approaches]] should not replace "harder" regulations or financial disincentives when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. Strong laws, bans on toxic materials or plastic wrapping, and smarter regulation to stimulate innovation (e.g., sandbox regulation for experiments) are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

## [[Role of Behavioral Science in Climate Adaptation]]

### Ethical Considerations and Co-design
*   **Customer Segmentation:** When designing services and interventions, segmentation can target households that cause the most emissions (e.g., those on oil boilers) or those most likely to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. However, this presents [[Challenges in addressing climate change | challenges]] for equitable services, as giving something to some people and not others can be perceived as unfair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. A key ethical consideration is ensuring that interventions only make some people better off, rather than making others worse off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Trust:** Good governance of nudging involves being transparent with citizens, avoiding manipulation, and clearly communicating the purpose of policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. "Dark nudges" used by companies highlight the importance of "nudging for good" in public policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   **Reducing "Sludge":** Simplifying complex processes and removing unnecessary barriers ("sludge") can make it easier for individuals and companies to adopt green behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
*   **Human-Centered Design and Citizen Participation:** Involving citizens systematically from the beginning in policy design, especially at local levels, can provide valuable insights into real problems and barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Integrating disciplines like human-centered design and architecture can help build spaces that facilitate desired behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Tools like citizen juries and panels can be effective for policy design and gaining public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.

## Call to Action for Policymakers
To effectively leverage [[Understanding Behavioral Science in Environmental Policy | behavioral science]] for green governance and [[addressing climate change]], policymakers should:
*   **Embed Behavioral Insights:** Make the use of behavioral insights a standard, embedded step in the policy process, similar to conducting a cost-benefit analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. This includes [[role_of_behavioral_insights_in_sustainable_energy_policies | understanding the key behavioral assumptions]] behind existing policy approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   **Implement Green Defaults:** Integrate green defaults into all policies (e.g., procurement, schools) as a quick way to change mindsets and drive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. While considering unintended side effects like redistributive or rebound effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Key Behaviors:** Prioritize and rally around a few high-impact behaviors that are relatively easy to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. An example is the City of Townsville's program to encourage painting roofs white, which led to widespread adoption and significant energy savings due to a coordinated effort across government, businesses, and communication with households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

[[innovation_portfolio_management | Innovation portfolio management]] involves making sense of an organization's various innovation projects and programs, even if they aren't formally acknowledged as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. It requires understanding the different types of innovation an organization engages in and how to effectively [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | steward innovation portfolios]] to achieve specific organizational aims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Why Portfolio Approaches Are Needed

Portfolio approaches are crucial for [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | stewarding innovation]] within the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Organizations naturally accumulate a set of different innovation projects and programs that form their implicit portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) uses the Innovation Facets Model to categorize these various types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Types of Innovation (OECD Innovation Facets Model)

The OECD categorizes innovation based on its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, recognizing that different types of innovation answer distinct questions related to the broader goals of the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>:

*   **Mission-oriented innovation**: Aims to achieve specific, often top-down, agreed-upon goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. It's about delivering on committed missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation**: Focuses on improving current systems to be more effective, efficient, or to reach more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This type has high levels of certainty, often driven by factors like austerity, cost reduction, or increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation**: Responds to new ideas and evolving situations from within the system itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. It cannot be steered top-down, requiring open space for employees to experiment and explore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation**: Addresses new risks, uncertainties, and future developments that might call current activities into question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This involves high uncertainty and support for ideas that may be critical to strategic goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

An organization's [[innovation portfolio management | innovation portfolio]] does not need to be equally balanced across these types, but they must be stewarded meaningfully towards specific organizational aims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | Stewarding Innovation Portfolios]]

Effective [[managing_innovation_portfolios | managing innovation portfolios]] involves several key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>:

*   **Making Sense of the Portfolio**: Understanding which types of innovations the organization is currently working on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Assigned Stewardship**: Someone must be assigned to steward the portfolio, making sense of information and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.
*   **Supportive Structures**: Creating environments where different types of innovation can coexist. For example, adaptive innovation needs space for experimentation, while mission-oriented innovation benefits from strong top-down leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Resourcing, Monitoring, and Evaluation**: Questioning how different innovations are resourced, monitored, and [[evaluating_impact_of_innovation_portfolios | evaluated across the portfolio]] as a whole, rather than just as single projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Individual innovations can fail, but the portfolio's success matters most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Learning and Communication**: Managing learning and communication within and about the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Connecting synergies between different innovation types is crucial, as is allowing for discussions about potential discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>.

## The Portfolio Exploration Tool

The OECD has developed a self-service online tool to help organizations analyze their organizational context, visualize their [[innovation portfolio management | innovation portfolio]], and develop innovation capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>.

**Purpose and Value**:
The tool aims to enable distributed, self-service [[innovation portfolio management | portfolio exploration]] and advising, especially in an era where physical workshops are challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>. It helps:
*   Show where to develop innovation capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>.
*   Recommend actions based on results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>.
*   Explore changes over time and identify intervention points for the [[innovation portfolio management | innovation portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>.

**Offerings**:
Currently, the tool offers a self-service online platform and a kit to help host and run independent [[innovation portfolio management | portfolio exploration]] sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

**Outputs**:
*   **Individualized Guidance**: Provides tailored results and guidance based on organizational inputs, showing percentage-based balance and strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>. For example, a result might show an organization is "strongly enhancement oriented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Management Capability Score**: Explores the strength of factors important for [[managing_innovation_portfolios | managing a portfolio]] within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
*   **Project-based Mapping**: Allows users to input their projects and visualize where they are placed across the different innovation facets (e.g., enhancement, mission, anticipatory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>. It provides guidance on what the distribution means and how to address discrepancies between organizational balance and project maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>.

**Levels of Analysis**:
The tool can be used at various levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>:
*   **Individual**: To understand personal or individual perspectives on the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">[01:16:04]</a>.
*   **Team**: To start conversations, see how a team fits into the organizational portfolio, and decide on roles or raise issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.
*   **Senior/Central Managers**: To get a snapshot, build [[innovation strategies | strategies]], and check alignment of efforts with ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>.

The tool provides anonymized aggregate data, offering a continuously updated global picture of innovation trends and informing future work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27">[01:15:27]</a>.

## Real-World Applications

### Natural Resources Wales (NRW)
NRW, formed in 2013, has a statutory duty to work collaboratively on sustainable development, considering future generations and embedding [[innovation ecosystems and portfolio management | ecosystem thinking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. They are one of the Welsh government's largest environmental bodies with a wide-ranging role, including advising, regulating, emergency response, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. The two biggest challenges they face are the climate emergency and the nature crisis, for which solutions are not yet fully embedded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

Luke Mags, an operational researcher, and Holly Butterworth, a specialist advisor for futures innovation, were tasked with coordinating NRW's informal approach to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. They started looking at the OECD tool based on advice from Nesta Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. The tool helped crystallize discussions and provide a framework for their existing, often unconscious, [[innovation portfolio management | innovation portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. It widened conversations beyond small groups of like-minded innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. For NRW, innovation is critical for their day-to-day operations and meeting statutory requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

### City of Lund, Sweden
Katarina Scott from the City of Lund works at an [[innovation portfolios in the public sector | innovation platform]] launched by the Swedish innovation ministry to push innovation down to the city level, where challenges are met hands-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. Lund is a university city with a history of innovation (e.g., Bluetooth) and is home to major research facilities, leading to an "explosion" of innovation that will impact the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.

The city, primarily focused on stable service delivery (streets, healthcare), needs to learn how to handle this influx of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. Their main challenge is creating awareness about using the potential of innovation within the city and collaborating with external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. They need a [[innovation_portfolio_management | portfolio thinking]] approach to understand what they do, don't do, and do with others, ensuring activities aren't happening randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. The tool provides a structured way to combine external inflow with internal thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>, preventing endless ideation without action and navigating political contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

## Key Concepts in Practice

### [[innovation_portfolios_and_systemic_solutions | Portfolio Balance]]
[[innovation_portfolios_and_systemic_solutions | Portfolio balance]] doesn't mean an equal number of projects or equal funding across all innovation types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>. Organizations have different purposes, so their portfolios will reflect that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. For example, a welfare service provider might have a very adaptive portfolio, while an organization like NASA would have a highly anticipatory and [[missionoriented_portfolio_management | mission-oriented portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.

*   **NRW's Experience**: Their tool outputs showed they are very strong in the enhancement space, which is natural for a public sector organization with highly specialized staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. However, they need to be stronger in the anticipatory space to address massive challenges like climate change and nature collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. They believe that while balance isn't about equality, having capability in each area is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.
*   **City of Lund's Experience**: The tool fostered conversations and highlighted that enhancement and anticipatory areas were often not considered "innovation" within the organization, meaning they lacked specific goals or resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. The tool's ability to visualize these different areas and their needs allowed for discussions on how they fit together, including external collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.

### Finding Synergies and Discords
The tool helps in seeing where innovations are happening and prompting conversations to identify synergies between projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. It also reveals potential discords or conflicting intents between projects, which can be "discord by design" – for instance, anticipatory innovations designed to question existing missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. Organizations can leverage the political legitimacy of mission-oriented projects to create space and build capacity for more experimental or questioning approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>.

### [[managing_innovation_portfolios | Portfolio Management Capability]]
This capability is about who is responsible for collecting and making sense of innovation information, periodically reviewing it, and evaluating the overall performance of the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.

*   **Levels**: [[managing_innovation_portfolios | Portfolio management]] can occur at different levels: city-wide, ministry-wide, or even at a team level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>. For cross-cutting issues like climate change, portfolios need to be considered beyond individual units, looking at how different units' portfolios interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Activity**: It must be an ongoing activity, not a one-time assessment, as innovation and activities constantly change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.
*   **Evaluation**: Evaluating the portfolio's performance is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. A 100% success rate in innovation indicates insufficient risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. The goal is for the portfolio to move the organization towards strategic goals or help avoid undesired futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
*   **Partnerships and Communication**: Analyzing how private or network partners' portfolios match with the public sector's can incentivize collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.
*   **Defining Innovation**: While the tool classifies types, organizations must define what counts as "innovation" for their portfolio. A common definition is that it should be "novel to the context," implemented, and have an impact (shifts in public value or change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.

**Challenges in Implementation**:
*   **Bureaucracy vs. Entrepreneurship**: Adding "management" to innovation can lead to rigid processes and rules that stifle the inherent entrepreneurship needed for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>.
*   **People Relations**: Effective [[managing_innovation_portfolios | portfolio management]] requires connecting systematic approaches (goals, measurements) with strong people relations, finding "champions" who will drive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.
*   **Neutral Facilitator**: A neutral facilitator is often needed to negotiate between different areas and external partners, navigating the "unclaimed space" until solutions fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.
*   **Time**: [[managing_innovation_portfolios | Portfolio management]] and achieving results can take years, requiring patience and persistent networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.
*   **Celebrating Successes**: It's crucial to focus on strengths and communicate successes to maintain morale and avoid being obsessed with problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
*   **Capacity**: Even with dedicated specialists, protecting their capacity from being spread too thinly is a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.

The tool itself is just an enabler; it takes dedicated organizations and teams willing to have difficult conversations and embark on a journey of deeper exploration to truly make an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>.

## Getting Involved

The portfolio exploration tool will be released in advance of the "Government After Shock" event, a program to bring together global conversations about the implications of major crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>. This event on November 17th (followed by a high-level forum on the 18th) will address key questions: What do we need to leave behind? What do we want to keep? What should we do differently? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:29">[01:20:29]</a>. The tool provides an opportunity to take stock and assess if current approaches are suited to a changed context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.

Users can sign up to host their own self-organized strategy sessions using the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:39">[01:21:39]</a>. These sessions, recommended for small groups (10-15 people) initially, involve participants completing the self-assessment tool in advance (30-45 minutes) and then having a facilitated discussion (2 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>. A kit including access to the tool, a facilitation guide, and tips will be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:40">[01:23:40]</a>.

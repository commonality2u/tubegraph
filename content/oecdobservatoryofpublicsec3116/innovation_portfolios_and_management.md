The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation at the OECD has developed a new model for public sector [[innovation portfolio management in the public sector | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This model outlines four distinct types of innovation, created based on two variables: having a clear purpose or direction to innovate, or having a discovery process as the core variable; and the level of uncertainty or certainty associated with the innovation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Types of Innovation

The four types of innovation identified are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:

*   **Mission-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>: This type requires clear goals and targets for people to work across silos and achieve government objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>: Individuals need a license to explore and discover new ideas and topics that could be useful or transform the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Anticipatory innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>: This type demands significantly more autonomy, as future technological developments often challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Enhancement-oriented innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Managing Innovation Portfolios

Different types of innovation necessitate distinct activities and support systems within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Therefore, governments require four different types of [[innovation strategies | strategies]] to boost and promote innovation within their countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Ultimately, governments should aim to have [[innovation portfolio management in the public sector | innovation portfolios]] that include all these different types of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These portfolios need to be balanced in a way that aligns with the future goals of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The management and [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | stewarding]] of these innovation portfolios are ongoing areas of engagement for the Observatory of Public Sector Innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. They seek feedback on how governments can create, manage, and steward these [[innovation strategies | strategies]] to develop optimal solutions for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

[[Crossborder government innovation | Cross-border government innovation]] and [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_sector_innovation | public sector innovation research]] have historically concentrated on a government's capacity to innovate within its established territories and jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, in a continuously changing world where problems have shifted from complicated to complex, and from local to global, governments increasingly need to collaborate to find new solutions for shared issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated that governments can act fast and unleash innovation at an unprecedented pace and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Yet, it has also highlighted shortcomings and reinforced existing vulnerabilities, such as a lack of preparedness among governments to tackle [[challenges_and_solutions_in_global_governance | global challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Major issues like COVID-19, climate change, digitalization, and migration are not confined by jurisdictional borders, demanding [[government_collaboration_across_borders | collective action across countries and policy fronts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Challenges in Crossborder Collaboration

Despite the clear need, [[crossborder_government_innovation | government innovation efforts]] are largely confined to national or local borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Research by the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) and the UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Center for Government Innovation has sought to understand why [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border innovation]] is not happening more often and why it is so challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

Key [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges identified]] include:
*   **Lack of Preparedness and Institutions** Only half of OECD countries have dedicated institutions tasked with identifying novel, unforeseen, or complex crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Weaknesses in International Cooperation** The increasing interconnectedness of countries has made the world more vulnerable to common threats, exposing weaknesses in [[challenges_in_fostering_international_cooperation | international cooperation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Perceived Lack of Permission** Government agency personnel sometimes feel they lack permission to look across borders, fearing that efforts invested in cross-border learning and collaboration might be frowned upon or not align with their Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Language Differences** Understanding the culture and language of the other party is a significant issue in any form of cross-border cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. National stereotypes, while joked about, are often present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.
*   **Tribalism and Focus on Internal KPIs** Individuals and organizations often believe their work is the most important, making it difficult to convince superiors of the value of [[crossborder_government_innovation | cross-border]] or [[Intergovernmental and crosssectoral collaboration | cross-sectoral work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
*   **Funding Metrics** Treasury funding metrics can pose a barrier, where benefits generated on both sides of a border by an investment are sometimes netted off, preventing co-investment for more efficient outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>.
*   **Geographic Proximity Limitations** While cooperation often happens with neighboring countries due to cultural and geographic proximity, building trust and collaboration with countries further away is significantly less common despite global trade patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.
*   **Public Discourse and Media Trends** Social media and the decline of foreign correspondents can lead to polarization and a reduced public interest in [[Crossborder collaboration in public services | cross-border]] or international news, making it harder to push through cross-border initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Change** It is easier to stick to familiar ways of working, and engaging in [[government_collaboration_across_borders | collaboration]] involves transaction costs and learning new methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty** [[Challenges and solutions in global governance | Global challenges]] inherently involve uncertainty. The natural inclination of politicians might be to close shop and turn inward, but this is counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.

## Success Factors in Crossborder Governance

To overcome these [[challenges_faced_by_governments | challenges]], several success factors have been identified:

### Building Trust and Relationships
*   **Personal Touch and Human Interaction** [[Crossborder collaboration in public services | Cross-border implementation]] relies heavily on human contact and building relationships between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. Investment in these relationships is key for ongoing value, making it easier to communicate and share information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.
*   **Learning to Live with Uncertainty** Rather than avoiding uncertainty, it's crucial to learn to live with it, as it is a constant in global challenges. This involves keeping options open, continuously learning, sharing risks, and pooling resources with partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>.

### Strategic Approaches and Governance Structures
*   **Securing Leadership** Gaining political support and senior leadership buy-in from agencies is crucial for validating [[Crossborder government innovation | cross-border innovation]] efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Common Mission and Goals** Agreeing on a common mission and strategy is vital for successful [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_sector_innovation | cross-border projects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. A concrete, limited starting point for cooperation is often easier to manage than a large, undefined understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
*   **Innovative Governance Bodies** Creating new formal "top-down" or "center-out" structures can harness collective efforts of actors divided by borders, bringing them together in a structured way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
    *   **Example: Kvarken Council** The Kvarken Council is the first legal Nordic cross-border entity, leveraging [[Intergovernmental and crosssectoral collaboration | cross-sector collaborative methods]] to drive future-oriented opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Their success includes a new environmentally friendly ferry between Sweden and Finland and the formation of a Nordic battery belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
*   **Innovative Networks** Complementing formal bodies, horizontal linkages and informal approaches nurtured or participated in by governments, where control is ceded to other groups, foster [[crossborder_collaboration_in_public_services | cross-border collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
    *   **Example: Open European Dialogue** This network of parliamentarians across Europe allows members from different countries and opposing parties to collaborate through experimental dialogue methods, fostering shared learning in a neutral space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Emerging Governance System Dynamics** Pioneering holistic new governance systems for [[crossborder_collaboration in public services | cross-border collaboration]] can foster new ways of working together. This includes co-financing, co-governance, co-project management, and shared policy and service design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
    *   **Example: Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal** This new governance system in North England and South Scotland secured nearly Â£500 million in co-funding for a unified approach to inclusive growth, bringing together local jurisdictions for collective impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **Leveraging International Frameworks** Using common platforms like the EU can make it easier to get things done and secure funding, especially when projects don't have to compete with national priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.

### Skills and Capabilities for Public Servants
*   **Developing Cross-border Skills** [[Crossborder collaboration in public services | Cross-border cooperation]] is not an innate skill; it must be learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. Governments need to invest in making public servants capable of developing and running such projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.
*   **On-the-Ground Experience** Bringing public servants to the border areas and having them work with communities who live and work there helps them recognize and solve problems directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>.
*   **Listening and Learning** A personal and institutional commitment to listening and learning from others is the first step to opening doors for [[government_collaboration_across_borders | collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.
*   **Carrots and Sticks** Building capacity requires both incentives (carrots) and mandatory requirements (sticks) ingrained in law or international standards to ensure that considering cooperation becomes a systematic part of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Recommendations for Action
> To support [[crossborder_collaboration in public services | cross-border collaboration]], recommendations include:
> *   Securing leadership and collective vision among all partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.
> *   Implementing suitable enablers and dynamics, such as co-funding models and co-governance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.
> *   Sharing costs and benefits with the understanding that not everything will be equal, aiming for a net benefit for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>.
> *   Being a good partner and fostering strong, long-term relationships to build trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:37">[01:13:37]</a>.

The work on [[crossborder_collaboration in public services | cross-border collaboration]] is continuing, with further reports and a "playbook" planned to break down recommendations into actionable guidance for governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>.

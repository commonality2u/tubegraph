[[ideation_process_and_strategies | Ideation]] is a critical component of public sector innovation, focusing on the formation and generation of ideas and concepts to address problems and create solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. It extends beyond simple brainstorming to encompass finding, screening, and prioritizing the most effective ideas from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

## The Reality of Public Sector Innovation

Innovation in the public sector often highlights resounding successes, such as advanced robotics or artificial intelligence applications, but rarely reveals the "tears" and "sweat" — the failures, false starts, and false steps — that occur behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. There's a tendency to celebrate triumphs and showcase differences only when things work out, while the underlying challenges and processes remain unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The aim is to demystify this process and reveal what it truly takes to innovate in the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## The Role of the Observatory for Public Sector Innovation (OPSI)

The Observatory for Public Sector Innovation (OPSI), founded in 2013, works closely with the European Commission and governments globally to uncover "what's next" in public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. OPSI focuses on:
*   Identifying innovative practices at the edge of government worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   Providing trusted advice to governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   Identifying contextual and system-specific barriers to innovation, often using systems thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   [[developing new ideas | Developing frameworks]] and methods to help countries understand and conceptualize innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

## The Innovation Life Cycle and Problem Framing

[[the_discovery_process_in_innovation | Innovation]] is viewed through a life cycle that includes identifying problems, [[ideation_process_and_strategies | generating ideas]], [[developing innovation proposals | developing proposals]], implementation, evaluation, and diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Problem Framing

A critical initial step in the [[ideation_process_and_strategies | ideation process]] is thorough problem framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This concept is often illustrated by the "double diamond" design model, which includes a problem definition phase and a solution creation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   **Common Public Sector Challenge**: Civil servants often begin after the problem has already been defined, sometimes even being given a solution to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. This bypasses the critical "discover" and "investigate" phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   **Consequences of Skipping Problem Framing**: Neglecting problem framing leads to negative results, projects failing to deliver expected returns, and general disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **Advocated Approach**: Spend more time defining the problem, understanding its context, and thoroughly studying it before moving into the solution space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
*   **Innovation within Constraints**: Even when a problem or solution is dictated (e.g., by politicians), there is always room to innovate by finding better ways to implement solutions or iterating on existing ones, rather than radical transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

## What is [[ideation_process_and_strategies | Ideation]]?

[[ideation_process_and_strategies | Ideation]] involves the formation of ideas and concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. In innovation processes, it means finding the best ideas from internal or external sources and then screening and prioritizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

### Ideation - What It Is and Isn't
*   **Not just brainstorming**: A common misconception is that ideation is solely about closed rooms with sticky notes resulting from brainstorming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. While brainstorming is a part of it, it's not the whole picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. The best results are not produced by isolating a select few to come up with ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
*   **Connected to problems**: [[ideation_process_and_strategies | Ideation]] is deeply connected to the type of problem being solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. It can involve exploring options for specific unknown problems, or signaling to external parties (citizens, companies) the types of problems the public sector is interested in solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.
*   **Broader than a single session**: [[ideation_process_and_strategies | Ideation]] is a much broader process than just a few people in a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

### Dispelling the Myth of Creativity
*   **Creativity is a resource**: The idea that public servants are not "creative enough" to ideate is a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. Creativity is a resource that needs to be cultivated and doesn't happen on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.
*   **Groupthink is an enemy**: A major enemy of innovation and [[ideation_process_and_strategies | ideation]] in the public sector is groupthink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. When people spend too much time together and think alike, creativity suffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

### Cultivating Creativity for Ideation
*   **Diversity of Experiences**: Expand the number and background of people involved in problem discussions and [[ideation_process_and_strategies | ideation]] phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>.
*   **Constructive Conflict**: Build in a "little bit of conflict" to encourage more creative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>.
*   **Interdisciplinary Teams**: Engage people from different backgrounds (e.g., artists, architects, economists) to challenge thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.
*   **Exposure to New Ideas**: Read diverse materials and constantly challenge assumptions by understanding what is possible and cutting-edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Creativity**: Creativity isn't just coming up with entirely new ideas; it also means finding new applications for existing solutions in different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>.
*   **Experiential Learning**: People become more creative by having direct experience with innovative or creative projects and by being given opportunities to test ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:00">[25:46:00]</a>.
*   **Counteracting Expertise Bias**: Engage experts directly with the problem and affected citizens, rather than relying solely on their defined expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>. Facilitation is key to encouraging experts to set aside their "expert hat" and explore problems with a blank slate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>.
*   **Organizational Capabilities**: Beyond individual skills, organizational capabilities for innovation involve abilities, motivations, and opportunities (AMO model) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:15:00">[53:15:00]</a>. This means building a culture where innovation is a normal practice, not a side activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:47:00">[53:47:00]</a>.

## Tailoring [[ideation_process_and_strategies | Ideation Strategies]] to the Environment

[[ideation_process_and_strategies | Ideation]] is not a one-size-fits-all process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. The approach must match the innovation environment and the nature of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Context
Innovation can be viewed across two dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>:
1.  **Type of Uncertainty**:
    *   **Exploratory (High Uncertainty)**: Dealing with new technologies (e.g., AI, blockchain) where solutions and options are unknown, but there's great promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Exploiting (Certainty/Incremental)**: Making existing systems more effective or efficient by leveraging existing knowledge and adapting novel ideas to a specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
2.  **Directive Direction**:
    *   **Top-down Demand**: A clear directive or mission (e.g., education reform, tax system improvement) with expected outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Adaptive Innovation ([[Bottom up approach to innovation | Bottom-up]])**: User-driven experimentation where citizen feedback signals issues, allowing for quick adjustments to service design without top-level leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.

The quadrant you operate in (e.g., high uncertainty with top-down demand) dictates the type of ideas sought and the sources from which they should come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>. For high uncertainty, external signals and developers are crucial; for design-oriented or citizen-oriented problems, stakeholders and users are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

### Practical Checklist for [[ideation_process_and_strategies | Ideation]]

Before moving into [[ideation_process_and_strategies | ideation]], consider these five questions to ensure the process is appropriate and systematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>:
1.  **Problem Framing**: Have you spent enough time truly studying and understanding the problem, avoiding the common mistake of jumping directly to solutions with limited data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>?
    *   *Self-assessment:* Is the problem clearly defined? How certain is it? Is there agreement on the problem? Will it likely shift or stay the same? Are there existing solutions or previous experiences? Is there a clear, engaged owner of the problem with high-level discretion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:39:00">[43:39:00]</a>?
2.  **Innovation Environment**: Do you understand the political and organizational environment, including leadership's resistance to change and the influence of outside actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:12:00">[35:12:00]</a>?
3.  **Strategy Match**: Does your [[ideation_process_and_strategies | ideation strategy]] match your environment?
    *   For emergent, uncertain spaces: Use broad methods like crowdsourcing or idea challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:30:00">[36:30:00]</a>.
    *   For known problems with less uncertainty: A smaller, select group might be appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:34:00">[37:34:00]</a>.
    *   For wicked, complex problems (e.g., poverty): Deep engagement through co-creation with specific representative groups, citizen stories, or pitching to relevant stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a>.
4.  **Right People Engaged**: Is the group involved diverse in backgrounds, thinking, and gender? A homogeneous group often struggles to generate truly new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a>.
5.  **Inclusive Contribution**: Does your [[ideation_process_and_strategies | ideation strategy]] allow everyone to contribute, accounting for different working styles (e.g., introverts needing more time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:45:00">[37:45:00]</a>? [[ideation_process_and_strategies | Ideation]] can span days or weeks, not just hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:40:00">[38:40:00]</a>.

## [[evaluating_and_filtering_innovative_ideas | Filtering and Evaluating Ideas]]

After [[ideation_process_and_strategies | generating ideas]], the next challenge is to narrow them down to a manageable handful that can be further explored or tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:41:00">[45:41:00]</a>.

### Challenges with Traditional Methods
*   **Simplified Scoring Models**: Commonly, ideas are filtered using scoring models based on components like novelty, usefulness, value, acceptance, feasibility, visibility, risk, and endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:34:00">[47:34:00]</a>. However, these often fail because:
    *   **Context Matters**: A single model cannot universally filter ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:20:00">[48:20:00]</a>. For mission-oriented innovation, consistency with the mission is paramount, while novelty might be irrelevant if an existing idea works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>. For anticipatory/radical ideas (e.g., new technologies), legitimacy and risk propositions may not matter initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:14:00">[49:14:00]</a>.
*   **"Shark Tank" / Pitch Formats**: Events where people pitch ideas can be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:05:00">[50:05:00]</a>. They often prioritize the pitcher's characteristics and sales ability over the quality of the idea itself, potentially excluding valuable ideas from less outwardly confident innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>.

### Inclusive Filtering
There isn't a single "best" solution for filtering ideas; the strategy must align with the goals and desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:26:00">[51:26:00]</a>. It's crucial to be aware of biases and consider different methods for a consistently inclusive filtering strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:55:00">[50:55:00]</a>. For instance, mission-oriented innovation might explore hundreds of ideas, while iterative exploration might lead to a list of five to ten options for experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:51:00">[51:51:00]</a>.

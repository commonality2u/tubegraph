Governments engage in [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] for various reasons, not solely to address specific challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While some [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] is driven by clear problems like cleaning oceans or solving homelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, another crucial aspect is the cultivation of the ability to innovate itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This involves fostering a culture of [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | experimentation and learning]] and building [[learning_and_capacity_building_in_government | capacity]] for future needs.

## Developing Innovation Skills Through Practice

The ability to innovate is not innate; individuals are not born innovators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Instead, [[Innovation Skills for Public Sector | innovation skills]] are learned through active engagement and practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This "learning by doing" approach is essential for public sector employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

To achieve this, public servants require a "license to explore" and to [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | experiment]] with new ideas, applying them in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This hands-on experience builds the necessary skills to innovate when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Building Capacity for Future Challenges

By engaging in "learning by doing," public sector entities develop [[learning_and_capacity_building_in_government | capacity]] to respond to unforeseen challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. When new, significant problems arise, having personnel with practical experience in building and solving problems in novel ways becomes invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. This proactive [[learning_and_capacity_building_in_government | capacity building]] ensures that the public sector is prepared for future demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

### Global Trends in Experimentation

This trend of fostering [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | experimentation]] and learning is evident in governments worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>:

*   **Finland**: The central government has implemented a new program focused on [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | experimentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Canada**: An "experimentation directive" is in action, allowing different government departments to [[Experimentation and Learning in Government | experiment]] with various policy ideas to assess their feasibility before large-scale implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Broader Drivers of Public Sector Innovation

Beyond problem-solving and [[learning_and_capacity_building_in_government | capacity building]], other factors also drive [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]] in the public sector:

*   **Exploration for its own sake**: Governments may innovate simply to allow individuals the freedom to explore new ideas and be creative in addressing citizen challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This "entrepreneurial discovery," common in the private sector, allows for transformative ideas to emerge from individuals given the license to experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Such exploration is crucial for revamping and transforming public sector services and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
*   **Staying competitive and relevant**: Governments also innovate to avoid being left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Like private sector companies, they continuously explore different options and solutions, not always for immediate application, but to be prepared for future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

All these reasons are valid drivers for [[Innovation in Public Sector | innovation]], necessitating diverse methods and approaches to support these activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

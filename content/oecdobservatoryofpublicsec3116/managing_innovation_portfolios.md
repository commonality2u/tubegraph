The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation at the OECD has developed a new model for public sector innovation, which emphasizes the concept of [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## A New Model of Public Sector Innovation

This model categorizes innovation into four distinct types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   Mission-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Adaptive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Anticipatory innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Enhancement-oriented innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

These categories are defined by two core variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>:
1.  **Purpose and Direction**: Whether there is a clear purpose or direction for innovation, or if the process is driven by discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  **Uncertainty**: The level of certainty or uncertainty associated with the innovation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Tailoring Support Systems

The Observatory argues that different types of innovation necessitate unique activities and support systems within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Governments therefore need four distinct types of [[Innovation strategies | strategies]] to effectively promote and foster innovation within their countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

The ultimate aim is for governments to develop [[innovation_portfolio_management | innovation portfolios]] that encompass all these different types of innovation, balanced in a way that aligns with the government's future goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Specific Needs by Innovation Type:
*   **Anticipatory-oriented innovation** requires greater autonomy because it often involves future technological developments that challenge the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Mission-oriented innovation** needs clear goals and targets to enable collaboration across silos and achieve government objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Adaptive innovation** necessitates a "license to generate" new ideas, allowing individuals to explore and discover concepts that could be useful or transform systems in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Future Engagement

The Observatory of Public Sector Innovation plans to further engage with the topic of how to [[innovation_portfolio_management | manage these innovation portfolios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. They seek feedback on both the different types of innovation and the [[innovation_portfolio_management | portfolio management]] aspects, aiming to understand what governments can do to create, [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | manage]], and [[stewarding_innovation_portfolios | steward these strategies]] to develop optimal solutions for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted public governance, underscoring the vital role of government and accelerating the need for innovative and agile approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This global crisis has served as a catalyst, revealing both the strengths and weaknesses of existing public administration systems and paving the way for significant [[public_sector_transformation_postcrisis | transformation post-crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

## OECD's Perspective on Future Governance

The OECD's Public Governance Directorate is actively examining the [[role_of_government_after_covid19 | role of government after COVID-19]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Their work focuses on a systemic approach to addressing the crisis, considering short-term, medium-term, and long-term responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Timeframes of Response

*   **Short-term**: Focuses on immediate responsiveness, emergency needs, and administrative simplification to react quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This includes leveraging government data for crisis understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:05]</a>.
*   **Medium-term**: Involves mapping processes for recovery, considering public financial systems, engaging stakeholders in economic reopening, and addressing transboundary issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. It also aims to learn from temporary rule suspensions to build lessons into future systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term**: Considers deeper, structural changes for public administrations to respond to future shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This involves envisioning the future public sector and its relationship with the economy and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. The responses to the crisis today are seen as "laying the seeds" for the government of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

The OECD's Public Governance Committee is actively capturing lessons from the pandemic to inform future policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

## Crisis as a Catalyst for Public Sector Innovation

The pandemic has undeniably been conducive to [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | public sector innovation during COVID-19]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
The crisis has:
*   **Emphasized clarity**: Innovation became "clearly needed" due to obvious inadequacies of existing solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Granted parity to new options**: The bias towards existing solutions diminished as they proved insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Enabled suitability**: New ways of working were invested in and supported, sometimes at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Normalized experimentation**: Doing "something unusual" became perfectly normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

This surge in innovation has manifested in various forms:

### Digital Transformation
The [[impact_of_covid19_on_digital_transformation_in_the_public_sector | impact of Covid19 on digital transformation in the public sector]] has been significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. In Denmark, this was described as a "quantum leap" in digital transformation, even from an already strong starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   Widespread remote work for public sector employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:00">[25:30:00]</a>.
*   Rapid implementation of technologies like video consultations with GPs and chatbot services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>.
*   Digitalization of service delivery, such as virtual weddings and distant wedding registrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   Adaptive responses by legislatures to hold virtual meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.
*   Use of platforms like Signal for social work with young people who don't use email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:05:00">[27:05:00]</a>.

However, the rapid shift to digital also highlights issues of digital exclusion, as seen in Portugal where 20% of the population lacked internet access pre-crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a>.

### Enhanced Collaboration and Open Government
The crisis has demonstrated the reality and effectiveness of innovation ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:00:00">[43:00:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-sectoral collaboration**: Collaboration between government levels (e.g., regional hospitals and municipal home care in Denmark) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a>.
*   **Public-private partnerships**: Companies and volunteers 3D printing face shields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:52:00">[23:52:00]</a>.
*   **Civic tech movements**: Platforms like "Tech for Covid-19" in Portugal, involving 5,000 professionals providing online consultations, e-commerce support for local businesses, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:05]</a>.
*   **Collaborative work plans**: Portugal's collaborative work plan for public administration involved 22 projects with 27 public entities and civil society organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>.

### Re-evaluation of Values and Services
The crisis has led to a re-evaluation of essential services and what is considered important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:16:00">[53:16:00]</a>. This includes rethinking national health strategies by bridging previous tensions between public and private healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:34:00">[53:34:00]</a>.

### Shift in Innovation Perception
For municipalities that previously saw innovation as a "luxury," the crisis has shown it to be a "necessity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17:00">[36:17:00]</a>. This has led to an increased legitimacy of [[public_sector_innovation_during_covid19 | public sector innovation during COVID-19]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:08:00">[36:08:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Sustained Change

While the crisis has fostered innovation, ensuring these changes are sustained beyond the immediate emergency is a key challenge for [[public_sector_transformation_postcrisis | public sector transformation post-crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>.

### Avoiding "Defaulting Back to Old Ways"
Governments, as systems, tend to "default back to old ways" unless deliberate efforts are made to identify "tipping points" and push them into a new stable state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.
*   **Re-evaluating values**: Using newly appreciated values as a basis for systemic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>.
*   **Building trust**: Leveraging the new trust gained in government during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.
*   **Shifting management approaches**: Moving from a command-and-control model to a more socially active way of managing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

### Managing Multiple Speeds of Innovation
Government planning processes often prove insufficient for dealing with recurring crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:19:00">[52:19:00]</a>. A scenario-based approach, encompassing short, medium, and long-term horizons, can help integrate [[future_oriented_governance | anticipatory governance]] and [[future_oriented_governance | anticipatory innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:58:00">[52:58:00]</a>.

Bruno Montero outlines "Crossways" or challenges in this regard:
*   **Counteracting presentism**: Overcoming the tendency to focus solely on immediate problems while neglecting ongoing or future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "nostalgia of normality"**: Recognizing that the "new normal" should be better, not just a return to the pre-crisis state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
*   **Combating blame games and wishful thinking**: Fostering rational discussion and accepting that errors will occur, promoting an experimental approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.
*   **Balancing expertise with public debate**: Ensuring that technological solutions are debated publicly and incorporate diverse perspectives to avoid an "innovative environment" that excludes citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.

### Sustaining New Skills and Practices
The crisis has served as an "intense training ground" for public servants, developing their ability to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>. To sustain these gains:
*   **Socialize innovation**: Make successful innovations accessible and demonstrate their efficiency to ensure their longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>.
*   **Reinvest in innovation ecosystems**: Maintain the bidirectional transit and collaboration between public administration and external stakeholders (entrepreneurs, scientific community) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>.
*   **Focus on use, not just output**: Evaluate whether innovations are actually being used and understand why some good solutions are not adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.
*   **Embrace responsible innovation**: Think about the consequences of innovations, anticipate desired and undesired outcomes, and use foresight methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>.
*   **Continue experimentation**: View the crisis as a "huge laboratory" for testing, learning, improving, and reducing risk before large-scale implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>.
*   **Capitalize on collective resonance**: Engage public servants and citizens who felt a strong "collective resonance" during the crisis to build a "participatory state" as the new normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>.

## The Role of Innovation Units and Capacity

The [[impact_of_pandemic_on_government_practice | impact of the pandemic on government practice]] has shown that innovation units must adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>. They initially stepped back to allow front-line clinicians to innovate organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:36">[01:37:36]</a>, but now need to strategically work with these emerging innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:42">[01:37:42]</a>. Public sector organizations with existing strong innovation capacities are better positioned to elevate these new practices to a higher, more radical level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:58">[01:37:58]</a>.

Pierre Schrade emphasizes that public sector innovation itself should not be the same after COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:09">[01:21:09]</a>. There needs to be a shift from "innovation theater" to "more dirty hands" and practical experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:42">[01:27:42]</a>. The focus should be on building the capacity and environment for professionals to innovate within their fields and learn from others, while addressing institutional slowness and ensuring innovation is on par with other government priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>.

Ultimately, the crisis has highlighted the public administration's "extraordinary capacity of adapting" and providing solutions to unprecedented challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a>. This is seen as a "catalyst and accelerator of a paradigm shift" in bureaucracy, building on a long, silent accumulation of small changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. The challenges of the future, including social impacts like unemployment, still require continued creative and innovative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:20">[01:26:20]</a>.

The concept of the circular economy is increasingly being connected with broader sustainability efforts in public sector innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. This trend involves governments seeking to combine sustainability with other initiatives, especially as environmental factors and the demand for [[sustainable_lifestyles_and_consumption_patterns | sustainable products]] grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. The core idea is to manage a product's lifecycle from creation to its end, considering how it can be reused or contained to act as an economic catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

## Innovation in Action

### Recyclables as Transportation Fare (Indonesia)
A notable example of the circular economy in practice is an initiative launched in the summer of 2018 in Surabaya, Indonesia, the country's second-largest city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This program allows citizens to pay for their bus fare using recyclable plastic bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

Indonesia is one of the world's largest producers of plastic waste, generating 190 million tonnes, yet its recycling rate is only 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. Approximately 3.2 metric tons of plastic waste from Indonesia end up in global waters, and four of the world's most polluted rivers are located there, including the Sitaram River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

The initiative, led by Mayor Tri Rismaharini, aims to tackle this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. For about two hours of bus travel, citizens can exchange approximately 3 x 1.5-liter bottles or 5 x 600-milliliter bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. Payment can be made directly on the bus or at off-site locations where bottles are exchanged for bus tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. Each bus can collect up to 250 kilograms of bottles daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

The city emphasizes that the program's goal is not profit, but rather to reduce waste, foster a circular economy, and enhance transportation accessibility for citizens who might lack the economic means to pay cash fares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. This highlights a "new currency" that opens doors and contributes to a more circular economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

### Other Related Initiatives
*   **Biofuel from Cow Manure (Pakistan)**: Another innovative case study involves Pakistan, where a project uses biofuel made from cow manure as a substitute for gasoline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
*   **Electricity for Organic Plants (China)**: In China, electricity is being utilized to grow more organic plants and reduce the need for pesticides in farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>.

These examples underscore the growing trend of integrating [[sustainable_lifestyles_and_consumption_patterns | environmental sustainability]] with social and economic goals, moving towards a more interconnected and resource-efficient future.

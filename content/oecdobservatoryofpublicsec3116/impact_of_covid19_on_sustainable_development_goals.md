The COVID-19 crisis has had a widespread impact on all aspects of society, including progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. Despite the immediate need to respond to the pandemic, Norway emphasizes the continued importance of the SDGs, especially given that only ten years remain to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

## Integrating SDGs into Crisis Response
Norway's Minister of Local Development and Modernization is also responsible for coordinating efforts to achieve the SDGs by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. A key strategy is to ensure that SDGs are not treated as separate initiatives but are instead incorporated into all government efforts at both national and subnational levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. This includes aligning [[impact_of_covid19_on_public_governance_and_policy | COVID-19 measures]] with SDG objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

### Challenges and Focus Areas
While acknowledging that a crisis response might cause other priorities to be placed on the back burner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>, the focus remains on crucial SDG elements:
*   **Addressing inequalities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.
*   Ensuring access to good education for all, especially vulnerable children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
*   Maintaining [[impact_the_pandemic_on_health_systems | good health services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   Promoting sustainable businesses through crisis support measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

### Collaboration and Coordination
The challenge lies in integrating SDGs naturally into all ongoing work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. The need to break down traditional government silos, a long-standing aspiration, has been accelerated by the crisis, benefiting both digitalization efforts and SDG attainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. There is a clear message to municipalities that SDGs must be integrated into their planning activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. This shared responsibility across levels of government also contributes to building trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

### Long-term Outlook
The [[Impact of COVID19 on global cooperation | COVID-19 crisis]] underscores the need for collective action to address complex global challenges like [[economic_repercussions_and_inequality_from_covid19 | growing inequalities]] and climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. The experience of being "all in the same boat" during the pandemic may foster the unity required to tackle these broader issues once the immediate crisis subsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

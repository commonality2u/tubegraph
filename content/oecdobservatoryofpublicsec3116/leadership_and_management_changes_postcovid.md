Daniel Gerson, Senior Project Manager for Public Employment and Management at the OECD Governance Directorate, introduced a discussion on skills for the future in the public sector and how to effectively identify and develop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. A central question for the panel was whether public managers are willing and ready to learn from the COVID-19 crisis and adapt their management methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This discussion explored the future of work in public service, focusing on how public administrations prepare for a future that is more digital, flexible, and full of crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## The Impact of COVID-19 on Public Sector Management

The COVID-19 pandemic has radically changed the way public administration works, transforming how employees operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. Historically, the image of public administration was often seen as non-flexible and not [[resilience_and_innovation_in_pandemic_response | resilient]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. However, the crisis challenged this stereotype, demonstrating that the public sector can be adaptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This presents an opportunity to renew the image of public administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Public Managers' Readiness to Adapt: Poll Results

A poll was conducted to gauge whether public managers are willing and ready to learn from the crisis and adapt their management methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The results indicated:
*   50% believe public managers are willing to acknowledge lessons learned but less willing to change actions and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   28% are optimistic, believing managers are willing and ready to learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.
*   21% stated their management is eager to return to the old normal status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

These results highlight that while there's much to learn, translating those learnings into action can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Leadership and Management

### Organizational Inertia
Cheryl Chung from Singapore Futures highlighted several forms of organizational inertia in the public sector:
*   **Precedent and Existing Policies**: The reliance on "who has done it before" and established policy guidelines can hinder change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Competency and Culture**: Existing competencies can limit problem-solving approaches, making it hard to bring in diverse talent (e.g., hiring designers instead of only economists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Organizational culture also influences whether new talent can thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Organizational Habits and Routines**: Fixed budget cycles, review periods, or meeting schedules can constrain flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### The "New Normal" and Continuous Adaptation
The pandemic has established a "new normal" where the goal is to move forward to a new way of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>. Peter Pogotar, Director General of the Public Sector Directorate in Slovenia, stressed that old ways of working won't keep up with rapid changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. This means a shift from planning the future based on past events to anticipating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.

## Evolving Leadership and Management Skills
The current volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environment necessitates adapted leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### Key Skills and Approaches
*   **Trust-Based [[leadership_during_the_COVID19_crisis | Leadership during the COVID19 crisis]]**: Building trust is crucial for achieving work results and driving change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>.
*   **Focus on Results**: Managers must shift from being process and regulation-driven to focusing on desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.
*   **Soft Skills**: Fabiana Scapolo from the European Commission emphasized the importance of soft skills such as:
    *   Critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>
    *   Creative problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>
    *   Teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>
    *   Empathy and care for each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>
    *   Adaptation to change and its management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>
*   **Distributed Leadership**: Instead of a centralized, top-down model, there's a need for more distributed and bottom-up leadership, especially with emerging millennial workforces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>. Examples include "shadow boards" of young people to give them power and new perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.
*   **Creating Space for Innovation and Mistakes**: Leaders need to create conditions for [[innovation_strategies_during_COVID19_recovery | innovation]] to flourish, including allowing for mistakes and fostering a psychologically safe environment where staff can speak up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. This requires abandoning a "blame error culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.
*   **Focus on Middle Management**: Peter Pogotar noted that re-skilling and continuous learning are especially crucial for middle and line management to prepare the civil service for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.

## Innovation in Public Sector Learning and Work

### Digitalization and Remote Work
The pandemic significantly accelerated the use of digital tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. Public administrations quickly adapted to remote work and digitized processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This has led to the development of hybrid work models, combining remote work with in-office presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

### Learning Mechanisms
*   **Deliberative Learning Practices**: Cherly Chung suggested fostering more reflective time in the workday, book clubs, and spaces for sharing experiences (including failures) to make the public service more agile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.
*   **Experiential Learning**: Cherly Chung described an "inequality walk" to train observational skills, empathy, and ability to dialogue on complex issues, even when uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. This is being adapted online to scale up reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Management**: Katarina Primovich Ramovez shared the concept of a "Center of Excellence" from the private sector â€“ a one-stop store for knowledge sharing that connects HR and technical teams across regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.
*   **Developing Soft Skills**: Her company also launched "master talks" focused on practicing effective communication, self-leadership, effective meetings, public speaking, cross-department collaboration, and connection in hybrid environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Digital Platforms**: Fabiana Scapolo highlighted the use of online platforms (e.g., Mural, Miro) for collective intelligence and engaging stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. These tools bring participants to an equal level and allow for clearer structuring of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>.
*   **Addressing Unknown Unknowns**: To prepare for unexpected challenges, public sector organizations need to push for transformation, break down silos, reform user-centered services, introduce more experimentation, and use evidence-based policy with data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>.

## Public vs. Private Sector Differences

While many discussions are relevant to both public and private sectors, some distinctions remain:
*   **Recruitment Flexibility**: The public sector is often slower in recruiting for new or emerging needs, making it harder to acquire expertise in-house quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of good internal training capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>.
*   **Technological Deployment**: The impact of new technologies in the public sector is immense due to security concerns and organizational size, making deployment slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>.
*   **Accountability and Risk-Taking**: The public sector, dealing with taxpayers' money, faces high accountability, which can make managers hesitant to take risks or deviate from strict procedures, even for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>. Senior management needs to be ready to back up calculated risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>.
*   **Blurring Boundaries**: There's an increasing blurring of the line between public and private sectors, with more private sector-type contracts, outsourcing, and the growing influence of private tech giants on citizen data and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>.

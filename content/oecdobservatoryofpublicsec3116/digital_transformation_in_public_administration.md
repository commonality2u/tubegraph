Daniel Gerson, Senior Project Manager for Public Employment and Management at the OECD Governance Directorate, highlighted the importance of discussing skills for the future in the public sector and how to effectively identify and develop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The OECD's work often focuses on the future of work in the public service, including how public employers and central public administrations are preparing for a future that is "more digital" and "more flexible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Readiness for Change and the Impact of COVID-19

A key question posed to participants and panelists was whether public managers are willing and ready to learn from the COVID-19 crisis and adapt their management methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The poll results showed:
*   **50%** believe public managers are willing to acknowledge lessons learned but less willing to change actions and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **28%** are optimistic, believing managers are willing and ready to learn and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.
*   **21%** think managers are eager to revert to the old normal status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

Peter Pogotar, Director General of the Public Sector Directorate in the Ministry of Public Administration in Slovenia, observed that the pandemic demonstrated that public administration was not as non-flexible or non-resilient as often perceived, offering an opportunity to renew its image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The pressure on public service and civil service has never been stronger, with high expectations during and after the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He emphasized that the [[Digital transformation in public administration | digital technologies]] and the pandemic have already "radically changed" how public administration works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

Cheryl Chung, Program Director of Executive Education at Singapore Futures and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, expressed a "slightly less optimistic view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, citing organizational inertia due to:
*   **Precedent and existing policies:** The need to always follow established guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Competency and culture:** Governments find it hard to bring in diverse talent outside normal hiring processes, like hiring designers when accustomed to economists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Organizational habits and routines:** Fixed budget cycles, review periods, and meeting schedules can constrain new ways of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

Katarina Primozic Ramovez, Head of HR at Nilfisk (private sector), believes readiness is essential given that the new reality is a "fact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. She noted that the past year proved it's possible to work remotely and [[digitalization_of_government_services | digitalize processes very quickly]] in both private and public sectors while remaining effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

Fabiana Scapolo, Head of the Competence Center in Foresight at the European Commission, affirmed the need to adapt and innovate in both public service organizations and policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. She highlighted the rapid adoption of digital tools within the Commission during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.

Daniele Dotto, Deputy Director of Directorate B at DG REFORM, European Commission, observed a "lot of requests to change" from member states, but also a tendency for "bad habits to fly back very rapidly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. He emphasized that [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation]] is a key driver for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

## Skills for the Future

The discussion revolved around equipping the workforce with the right skills and management structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Future jobs will demand "totally different skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   Many people will need to "re-skill in the next five years as adoption of technology increases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   The [[role_of_digital_transformation_in_public_administration | role of public administration]] is to enable skill development for public employees and provide necessary training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Core and Soft Skills
Fabiana Scapolo stressed the importance of developing "soft skills" for leaders to navigate complex working environments, including critical thinking, creative problem-solving, teamwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>, empathy, and care for each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. Peter Pogotar mentioned specific emphasis on leadership, communication, crisis management, and digital skills in Slovenia's training programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. Katarina Primozic Ramovez emphasized that "digital literacy" and "awareness on information security" are minimum standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.

## Leadership and Management in the New Normal

The consensus was that "good leadership" might not be the same as before the crisis, and transformation is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   **Shift in Culture:** Leaders must change their culture of management, focusing on results, efficiency, and encouraging continuous self-development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **Trust:** Leadership based on trust is crucial for achieving work results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. Daniele Dotto noted that governments and regions with more trust were faster and more efficient in deploying crisis measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>. Trust facilitates change and makes teams more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **Delegation and Innovation:** Leaders must create conditions for [[innovation_in_public_administration | innovation]] by delegating and allowing space for mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>. This means abandoning a "blame error terror culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.
*   **Psychological Safety:** Creating psychologically safe environments where staff can be themselves and speak up freely is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.
*   **Distributed Leadership:** Cheryl Chung questioned the traditional top-down, centralized leadership model, suggesting exploring more "distributed" and "bottom up" leadership models, possibly with "shadow boards of young people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
*   **People-First Approach:** Katarina Primozic Ramovez highlighted the importance of a people-first approach, listening to employees through dialogues and surveys to develop flexible working arrangements such as hybrid models, job sharing, and flexible hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

## Learning and Development

The speakers discussed innovative learning tools and approaches:
*   **Anticipation over Planning:** Peter Pogotar emphasized a shift from planning the future based on past events to anticipating it, given the rapid changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.
*   **Experiential Learning:** Cheryl Chung described "inequality walks" that train observational skills, empathy, and the ability to dialogue with diverse colleagues, making policy a "messy process" rather than a perfectly solvable problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. She noted the potential to scale these online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.
*   **Knowledge Management:** Katarina Primozic Ramovez described developing a "center of excellence" for knowledge sharing, connecting HR and technical teams across different countries to maintain competencies and support collaborative training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.
*   **Soft Skills Training:** Her organization also launched "meal master talk" focused on practicing effective communication, self-leadership, effective meetings, public speaking, and cross-department collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.
*   **Digital Collaboration Tools:** Fabiana Scapolo highlighted the use of platforms like Mural and Miro in foresight workshops to bring participants to an "equal level" and structure ideas more clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:38">[01:04:38]</a>.
*   **Creativity in Team Dynamics:** Daniele Dotto noted increased creativity among managers in finding ways to connect with teams during the crisis, such as informal social activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.

## Public vs. Private Sector Distinction

While many principles apply to both sectors, some distinctions remain for [[digital_transformation_in_government | digital transformation in government]]:
*   **Recruitment Flexibility:** The public sector is slower in recruiting specialized expertise when new needs emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>.
*   **Technology Deployment:** The impact of opening up to new digital techniques is immense due to security dimensions and the size of public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>.
*   **Accountability and Risk:** Public sector organizations face stricter accountability for taxpayer money, making it harder to take risks or deviate from established audit trails, even for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:22">[01:17:22]</a>.
*   **Evolving Roles:** Cheryl Chung questioned the relative roles of public and private sectors, noting that tech giants often have superior data and insights into citizen behavior, potentially influencing policy outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. This suggests a "blurring of this boundary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.

## Commitments for the Future

Panelists shared personal commitments:
*   **Peter Pogotar:** To cherish and focus more on informal social contacts with co-workers for team building, which he learned was crucial during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:28">[01:23:28]</a>.
*   **Cheryl Chung:** To democratize futures thinking, especially connecting public and private sectors in a collective intelligence effort to build the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:02">[01:24:02]</a>.
*   **Katarina Primozic Ramovez:** To continue making a positive impact by "doing the right things in the right way" and "walking the talk" within her organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:56">[01:24:56]</a>.
*   **Fabiana Scapolo:** To reflect more on team performance than individual performance and to push for a flatter, more effective, and efficient organizational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:38">[01:25:38]</a>.
*   **Daniele Dotto:** To continue working with hybrid teams, respecting individual presence and absence, and to focus even more on training to help people handle any future crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:41">[01:26:41]</a>.

The discussion reinforced that while the crisis brought significant changes and forced adaptation, the challenge remains to sustain new ways of working and ensure that public managers not only learn but also actively transform their actions and behaviors. The need for [[agile_and_digital_transformation_in_government | agile and digital transformation in government]] is evident, requiring new skills, management approaches, and a rethinking of traditional structures for the future of public service.

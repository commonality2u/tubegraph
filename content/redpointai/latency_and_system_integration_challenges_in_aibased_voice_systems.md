The development and adoption of AI-based voice systems, while promising, face significant hurdles related to latency and complex system integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. These [[Challenges in AI product development]] hinder their full-scale deployment, particularly in established industries like telephony and customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Latency in Voice AI

Initial voice AI systems suffered from high latency, with conversational turns taking around 4 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This made natural interaction difficult. However, advancements have drastically reduced this to an average of 320 milliseconds when using systems like [[the_role_of_live_kit_in_voice_ai_applications | LiveKit]] with GPT-4o's real-time API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This speed is now on par with human conversational turnovers, which average around 300 milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. In fact, some models, like those from Cerebras, can achieve inference in as little as 100 milliseconds, to the point where they respond *too* quickly, interrupting the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

While advancements have largely overcome the technical latency challenges in model inference, the overall system latency remains a concern, especially in applications that require backend lookups or complex reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

### On-Device vs. Cloud Inference

A key aspect affecting latency and capability is the balance between on-device and cloud-based AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **On-device models** are crucial for immediate, "reflex" actions, particularly in robotics (e.g., a humanoid robot needing to react quickly to avoid an obstacle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Cloud models** are necessary for tasks requiring vast knowledge or complex reasoning, analogous to humans looking up information or calling support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

The ideal scenario for minimizing perceived latency might involve parallel processing, where both local and cloud models perform inference simultaneously, with the fastest relevant answer being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## System Integration Challenges

Despite significant progress in latency, the broader adoption of voice AI, particularly in established sectors like customer support, faces substantial [[Challenges in AI Adoption and Deployment]] due to complex system integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

*   **Existing Infrastructure**: Many industries already have deeply embedded, large-scale systems for voice interaction (e.g., telephone-dominated customer support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Swapping out these existing engines for new AI systems presents a significant risk to customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **AI Model Imperfections**: Current AI models are not perfect; they can hallucinate or make mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This necessitates a "human in the loop" to correct or take over from the AI agent, meaning organizations cannot fully eliminate their human contact centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Backend System Updates**: Many voice AI applications, such as customer support, require updating bespoke backend systems (e.g., Salesforce, custom ticket trackers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. While AI models are developing the ability to "touch" or manipulate applications (like Anthropic's computer use API), this capability is not yet fully mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. [[the_role_of_live_kit_in_voice_ai_applications | LiveKit]] is also building similar capabilities for agents to control headless browser instances and interact with web pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Data Privacy**: For privacy-sensitive use cases, there is a demand for purely local, on-device AI processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. However, even new systems like Apple Intelligence often rely on secure cloud processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Sending data to the cloud is generally expected for legal reasons, generating updated training data, and handling erroneous examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## The Role of [[the_role_of_live_kit_in_voice_ai_applications | LiveKit]]

[[the_role_of_live_kit_in_voice_ai_applications | LiveKit]] positions itself as the "nervous system" for AI, connecting human senses (eyes, ears, mouth via camera, microphone, speaker) to the AI "brain" (foundational models like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

The [[the_role_of_live_kit_in_voice_ai_applications | LiveKit]] SDK on a user's device captures speech and transmits it over [[the_role_of_live_kit_in_voice_ai_applications | LiveKit]]'s Edge Network to a backend "agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This agent processes the audio (e.g., converting speech to text for older models or sending raw audio directly to advanced multimodal models like GPT-4o) and sends the response back to the client device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
[[the_role_of_live_kit_in_voice_ai_applications | LiveKit]]'s infrastructure aims to facilitate the flow of information between humans and AI, making advanced multimodal interactions possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. This includes giving AI the "ability to touch" applications by controlling virtualized browser instances and streaming their video to users for interactive unblocking of agent tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Outlook

While [[speech_recognition_and_ai | speech recognition and AI]] models continue to advance, the next phase of AI-based voice systems will involve seamless integration of multiple modalities (voice, text, computer vision) and addressing the complexities of existing enterprise systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>. The transition will likely be a hybrid approach, combining autonomous AI agents with human-in-the-loop oversight and diverse interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.

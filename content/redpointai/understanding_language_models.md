Understanding the capabilities and limitations of [[use_and_evaluation_of_large_language_models_llms | language models]] requires a deep grasp of their underlying theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While agents can be well-connected with the capabilities of [[use_and_evaluation_of_large_language_models_llms | language models]] in some areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, this is not universally true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Capabilities

[[use_and_evaluation_of_large_language_models_llms | Language models]] excel at tasks that involve mixing and matching elements present in their [[building_and_utilizing_large_language_models | training data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. They can be highly effective for:
*   Answering or labeling emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Adding CSS to HTML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Iteratively debugging common Python problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

## Limitations

[[use_and_evaluation_of_large_language_models_llms | Language models]] struggle significantly with tasks requiring novel planning sequences that are not almost exactly present in their [[building_and_utilizing_large_language_models | training data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This includes:
*   Independently creating a research breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Generating novel algorithms, even if they are short (e.g., four or five lines of code), because such algorithms are by definition not found in the existing [[building_and_utilizing_large_language_models | training data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

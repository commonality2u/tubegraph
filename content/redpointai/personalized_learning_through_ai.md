Connor Wick, CEO of Speak.com, discusses the evolution and future of [[personal_learning_through_ai | personalized learning]] powered by AI, focusing on the company's English language learning platform. Speak.com, launched in 2019, has grown to over 10 million users in 40+ countries and is backed by OpenAI, recently valued at $500 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Foundational Principles

Connor Wick's entrepreneurial journey in education technology began in high school with a flashcard app, which amassed several million users and billions of cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. He envisioned aggregating this knowledge into a graph to "generate anything and teach anything that anyone wants to learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, aiming to create an "omniscient tutor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This early aspiration is now becoming a reality with the advent of large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. He believes flashcard data is particularly good for learning because it's structured around information someone is trying to memorize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Wick's deep dive into AI began around 2015, attending a Berkeley course where he became convinced that underlying models would significantly improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. His team focused on speech recognition due to the potential to build technology that feels like it has a "persona" and fosters a "relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Speak.com Product and Pedagogy

Speak is designed as a "full fluency solution" for language learning, emphasizing speaking and real conversations over grammar or rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The methodology involves teaching high-frequency word "chunks" that appear together in everyday speech, encouraging repetition until automaticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Users then practice in simulated conversations with real-world goals, tailored to their individual motivations, interests, and skill levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Technological Evolution and Strategy

Speak adopted a long-term, "North Star" oriented approach, anticipating that with more data and compute, AI models would eventually surpass human capabilities in learning tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This allowed them to build products aligned with future capabilities, iterating step-by-step from accurate speech recognition to phoneme recognition and language understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Balancing Innovation and Practicality
Founders must balance building around current model shortcomings versus waiting for future improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Speak prioritizes understanding and solving user problems even if it means swapping out core technology later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Moats and AI Firmware
Speak identifies several "technological moats":
*   **Specialized In-House Models**: They develop their own models for niche tasks like speech recognition for accented speakers, understanding specific mistakes, and fast, reliable streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **ML Scaffolding**: This refers to the "AI firmware"â€”all the complex technology built in-house to orchestrate models, integrate with backend systems, collect data, fine-tune, and evaluate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Connor considers this a larger and more significant long-term technological moat than core modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning and Iteration**: Building these models allows them to learn about different aspects, collect more data, and invest further in the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

### Evaluation Challenges
Evaluating AI models, especially for open-ended tasks, is crucial and difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. Connor believes a clear evaluation framework is key to problem definition and execution clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. This involves:
*   Beyond simple metrics like word error rate, understanding individual mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.
*   Sometimes intentionally "dumbing down" model understanding to human level for better pedagogical feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.
*   A structured playbook with internal tools, eval loops, and human-in-the-loop evaluations for new model releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   Tracking product metrics from user experiments to gauge real-world impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

### Model Costs and Pricing
Speak is not currently constrained by model inference costs for its subscription tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. They believe that as costs decrease, demand will increase, benefiting model providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. Their pricing strategy balances radical accessibility for hundreds of millions of people with the opportunity to charge significantly more for a premium consumer product, given that similar offline tutoring can cost hundreds of dollars per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

## User Experience and Interface Innovation

Speak faces the challenge of designing new interface paradigms for audio-first experiences. The goal is to minimize user education and tooltips by creating intuitive designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. An example is the microphone button in onboarding, where users are simply asked "why are you learning English?" but may feel unsure about how to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. However, increasing familiarity with generative AI apps like ChatGPT is rapidly evolving user understanding of these paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

The future of UI will likely be "hybrid," allowing users to fluidly choose between speaking, typing, or tapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. While speech is not always better, it offers significant advantages in many situations, especially with improved speech-to-speech models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

### Proactive AI
A significant future interface unlock is the concept of a "GPU that's like thinking about you in the background" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. This means the AI could proactively analyze user activity (e.g., an hour of speaking practice) and generate distilled analysis or lessons overnight to prepare for the next session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. This represents a shift from users "pulling" information to AI "pushing" relevant insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

## Business and Market Dynamics

### Disrupting vs. Sustaining Technology
Connor believes [[AI in education]] broadly helps incumbents if it merely improves an existing problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. However, if AI enables a fundamentally new solution (e.g., fully automating customer support instead of just making agents more efficient), it becomes highly disruptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.

### Speak vs. Duolingo
Speak and Duolingo solve different problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. Duolingo's primary audience consists of native English speakers in Western countries who were not previously learning a language, treating it as a casual "brain training app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. AI may not necessarily enhance this casual experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

Speak, by contrast, targets users, particularly in markets like South Korea, who have spent years trying to achieve conversational fluency but lack access to human speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>. For this use case, AI is profoundly helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.

### Impact of Foundational Models
While real-time translation (like a "Babble Fish") might obviate the need for casual tourists to learn a language, it doesn't address the fundamental human desire for connection that drives serious language learners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.
Connor views new foundational models like GPT-4o as a net positive for [[AI in language learning]] products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. Even if people initially try to learn with general-purpose AI like ChatGPT, it validates the concept of [[using_ai_for_personalized_user_experiences | AI for personalized user experiences]] in language learning, leading serious learners to seek specialized solutions like Speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.

## Future of Learning with AI

### Curriculum Design
While a "right sequence" exists for learning foundational vocabulary (e.g., the 100 most common words), AI can personalize the specific ordering within that framework based on individual user interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. Human expertise is still needed for high-level curriculum strategy, but machine learning teams are increasingly involved in curriculum creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. The ultimate goal is a "very unique" learning path for each individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

### Expansion Beyond Language
Speak sees opportunities to expand beyond language learning into three major sectors of learning:
1.  **Schools**: Traditional educational institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>.
2.  **Businesses and Professional Skills**: Developing and certifying skills for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. This includes areas like public speaking in a second language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>.
3.  **[[personal_learning_through_ai | Personal Learning]]**: An "invisible" but massive sector encompassing daily activities like reading, listening to podcasts, or watching videos â€“ anything driven by the desire to "become a better version of yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. Connor envisions this as a highly individuated experience, like the "omniscient primer" from Neal Stephenson's *The Diamond Age*, where AI has long-term memory and a mental map of a user's knowledge, interests, and personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.

### Timeline for Disruption
Connor believes that while little may change in a few years, a tremendous amount of change will occur over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. He feels that [[AI in education]] will be one of the biggest and most exciting areas of disruption, fundamentally changing how people learn, unlike previous technological shifts that merely digitized existing methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

> "The way that people learn... has the quality of education changed? Like fundamentally people are still basically taking quizzes but they're taking them on a laptop instead of a piece of paper... the quality of all that the efficacy like I don't really think it's changed very much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>

### Future of AI Models
Connor notes that while Transformers are currently dominant, he hopes research continues into other areas beyond this "local maximum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>. For language learning, improved multimodal and multilingual audio capabilities, especially low-latency, continuous models that combine speech recognition, LLMs, and speech synthesis, are a "holy grail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>. These models could capture more nuanced information like confidence, emotions, and subtle mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>.

While [[AI in education and human interaction | AI in education and human interaction]] still needs more development for higher-stakes subjects like math, language learning is uniquely positioned because current technology can already create fully useful and disruptive experiences without continuous human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. The challenge for other subjects lies in meeting a higher bar for user enjoyment, as existing solutions (e.g., classroom math teaching) are perceived as more effective than traditional language learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.

## Overhyped and Underhyped Aspects of AI

*   **Overhyped**: "Probably everything," especially the amount of funding without true product-market fit or real activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Underhyped**: Technology that isn't the Transformer, and the amount of research going into alternative approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>.

## Lessons Learned
A continuous challenge is that new technologies and capabilities are "never as good as you think it will be," and building something that genuinely changes user behavior is extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>. Initially, Speak thought they would build all their models in-house, but later realized that some models are too expensive or specialized for a single company to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.

## Conclusion
Connor invites interested individuals to visit Speak.com to learn more about the product or careers at Speak.com/careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. The podcast hosts conclude that Speak is an "incredible use case of AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>, demonstrating how AI can deliver a solution (personalized language tutoring) that was previously very difficult to achieve, creating a "profound shift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This approach may soon extend to other subject areas beyond language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.

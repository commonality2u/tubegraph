Arvin Duran, a computer science professor at Princeton, discusses the future of [[ai_in_education | AI in education]] and its potential impact on global equality, as well as the role of human interaction in this evolving landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Current State and Challenges in Educational Adoption
Students often perceive generative [[ai_in_education | AI]] primarily as a cheating tool and are hesitant to use it productively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. Duran actively encourages his students to explore productive uses of [[ai_in_education | AI]] despite potential pitfalls like hallucinations, emphasizing its capacity to enhance learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. He suggests that teaching productive ways to use [[ai_in_education | AI]] and avoid its pitfalls should become part of the curriculum from K-12 through college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

A recent paper on the rapid adoption of generative [[ai_in_education | AI]] found that 40% of people use it, but on average, only for half an hour to three hours per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. This "intensity of adoption" indicates that generative [[ai_in_education | AI]] adoption is actually slower than the adoption of personal computers (PCs) decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. This slower pace might be because [[ai_in_education | AI]] is not yet as broadly useful, or it could highlight areas where policy interventions could make a difference, such as upskilling teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

## The Future of Education with AI
Duran believes that while [[ai_in_education | AI]] will be used significantly in education, it is unlikely to fundamentally change the nature of learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. He compares the current excitement around [[ai_in_education | AI]] to the initial hype surrounding online courses like Coursera over a decade ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. The core value of education, he argues, does not come from the mere transmission of information, but from creating social preconditions for learning, such as motivation, connections, caring about subjects, and individualized feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. While [[personalized_learning_through_ai | AI]] can offer personalization and motivational feedback, it cannot fully replicate the human element in education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.

### Personalized Learning and Human Supervision
Duran emphasizes that while [[ai_in_education | AI]] has the potential for [[personalized_learning_through_ai | personalized learning]], human supervision is crucial, especially for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>. He describes building small [[personalized_learning_through_ai | AI]] learning apps for his own children, such as a phonics app or an app to teach telling time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. These simple applications can be created quickly (sometimes in minutes) using tools like Claude's artifacts feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>.

Duran predicts that in the future, children will use [[ai_in_education | AI]] for learning more significantly, but this will likely happen primarily outside of traditional schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>. Schools tend to be cautious about new technologies like [[ai_in_education | AI]], similar to their historical apprehension about devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. This reluctance could lead to high variance in [[ai_in_education | AI]]'s impact, with wealthier families able to monitor and leverage it for positive outcomes, while other children might face challenges like [[ai_in_education | AI]] addiction due to its highly personalized nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.

### Implications for Global Equality
There is a common hope that [[ai_in_education | AI]] will act as a democratizing force, making personalized assistance, tutoring, or even medical consultation widely accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. However, Duran cautions that the need for supervision, especially for children, and the potentially high costs of advanced models could limit broad accessibility, leading to a disparity between those who can afford such services and those who cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. While open models might allow countries to develop homegrown [[ai_in_education | AI]] applications, reliance on "test time compute" with expensive queries could make it harder for nations to be on a level playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

## Academia's Role in Human-AI Interaction
Academia's role in [[ai_in_education | AI]] extends beyond technical innovation to encompass the societal impacts and applications of [[ai_in_education | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. This requires interdisciplinary collaboration and a focus on making [[ai_in_education | AI]]'s impact more positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. Duran advocates for a portion of computer science academia (around 20%) to act as a counterweight to industry interests, similar to the independent role of medical researchers relative to the pharmaceutical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

One area of academic research he finds fascinating is the relationship between [[ai_in_education | AI]] and human minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. This includes studying the ethical reasoning of models, learning from human cognition to build better [[ai_in_education | AI]], and using [[ai_in_education | AI]] as a tool to better understand human minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.

The landscape of content creation is evolving, with a notable shift occurring in how platforms approach the generation and distribution of content. While platforms like Snapchat and TikTok have historically focused on similar end markets and [[future_of_ai_avatars | avatars]], their core approach to content creation differs from emerging AI-centric platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Current Landscape and Diverging Paths

Incumbent platforms, particularly those emphasizing vertical video, were built on the idea of enabling creators to easily produce video using mobile cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. In contrast, the value proposition for new platforms lies in making the camera obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This represents a fundamental divergence in strategy, moving away from direct human-camera interaction as the primary mode of content creation.

## Challenges of Content Integration

A significant dilemma for existing mobile platforms arises when integrating [[AI generated content | AI-generated content]] with traditional camera-based content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. If, for instance, 10% of content is generated by AI today, questions emerge regarding how to rank and recommend this content compared to the 90% that is camera-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The challenge intensifies if the ratio of [[AI generated content | AI-generated content]] to camera-based content approaches 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In such a scenario, mixing these two types of content could lead to existing content creators experiencing a significant reduction in views and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This highlights [[the_impact_of_ai_generated_content_on_current_content_creators | the potential impact of AI-generated content on current content creators]].

## The Emergence of New Platforms

Should the proportion of [[AI generated content | AI-generated content]] reach a critical mass where it significantly impacts traditional content, it may necessitate the development of entirely new platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. These platforms would be specifically designed for [[AI generated content | AI-generated content]], presenting a significant opportunity for new ventures in the digital media space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This development aligns with the broader [[future_of_generative_ai_in_media_and_creative_industries | future of generative AI in media and creative industries]].

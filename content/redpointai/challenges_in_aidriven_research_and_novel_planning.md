While AI agents are well-connected with the capabilities of language models in some areas, there are many places where they are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A deep understanding of underlying theory is necessary to comprehend these limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Limitations in Novel Planning

AI agents face significant [[challenges_in_ai_research_and_potential_solutions | challenges in AI research]] and novel planning. An agent requiring a planning sequence that isn't almost exactly replicated in its training data will be unable to perform the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Conversely, agents excel at tasks involving various mixes and matches of information present in their training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Examples of tasks AI agents are proficient at include:
*   Answering emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Labeling emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Adding CSS to HTML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Iteratively debugging common Python problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

## Barriers to Research Breakthroughs

A major [[challenges_in_ai_research_and_potential_solutions | challenge in AI research]] is the inability of agents to independently create research breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. For instance, in algorithm creation for research, even simple algorithms (four or five lines of code) cannot be assisted by language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This is because, by definition, such novel algorithms are not present in the training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

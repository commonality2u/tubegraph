Trust and safety are critical for businesses, particularly those serving large enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A key aspect of ensuring [[trust_and_data_security_in_ai | trust and data security in AI]] on platforms involves two main areas: the creation of avatars and the video content produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Safeguarding Avatar Creation

To prevent the unauthorized creation of digital avatars, a strict consent process is implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For every avatar generated on the platform, a video consent format is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This process is reinforced by advanced AI technology that matches the consent video with the footage to confirm it's the same person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This makes it nearly impossible to create an avatar without the individual's explicit consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Content Moderation

Platforms utilize a hybrid solution combining AI models and human review to ensure content adherence to policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Beyond AI-driven verification, a dedicated moderation team conducts human reviews of footage to ensure all content meets expected standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The platform's moderation policy strictly prohibits several categories of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:
*   Hate speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Misinformation targeting children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Any political campaign or related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

These measures contribute to maintaining [[ai_governance_and_data_security_within_enterprise_environments | AI governance and data security within enterprise environments]] and address [[concerns_and_considerations_for_ai_safety_and_regulation | concerns and considerations for AI safety and regulation]].

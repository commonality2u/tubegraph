## Traditional Platforms and Camera-Based Content

Existing platforms like Snapchat and TikTok have historically focused on similar end markets, including [[ai_avatar_technology_and_advancements | avatars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A key aim for these vertical video platforms was to empower creators to easily produce video content using [[impact_of_mobile_cameras_on_video_creation | mobile cameras]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Rise of AI-Generated Content

In contrast, the fundamental value proposition for newer platforms specializing in AI-generated content is to render the camera obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This shift signifies a move towards [[ai_video_creation_tools | AI video creation tools]] as the primary method of content generation.

## The Dilemma of Mixing Content Types

A significant challenge for mobile platforms arises when integrating AI-generated content with traditional camera-based content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. If, for instance, 10% of content is AI-generated, a dilemma emerges regarding how to rank and recommend this content compared to the remaining 90% of camera-based content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

The issue escalates if the ratio shifts to 50% AI-generated and 50% camera-based content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In such a scenario, mixing these content types could lead to existing human creators receiving significantly fewer views and less attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Future Platforms for AI Content

Should the proportion of AI-generated content reach a critical mass, there will be a necessity to establish new platforms specifically designed for this type of media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This presents a [[potential_opportunities_for_platforms_specializing_in_ai_content | new opportunity]] for platforms dedicated entirely to AI-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

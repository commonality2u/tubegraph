The realm of AI for creative tools is currently in its early stages, with much more development anticipated in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Realism, control, and fidelity in generative AI models have significantly improved, but there remains a long way to go for better control tools, higher fidelity, longer generations, and improved model consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. The current capabilities are merely the beginning of what will be seen in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## The Mindset of Exploration

When approaching AI models, particularly for creative tasks, the most effective strategy is to come with a willingness to [[experimenting_and_testing_ai_use_cases | experiment and explore]], rather than fixed, concrete ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. The AI system can aid in uncovering new ideas and exercising a different part of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

The speed of current models allows for rapid visualization, enabling users to explore new concepts much faster than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. The best results often come from those who embrace an [[experimenting_and_testing_ai_use_cases | experimentation]] mentality and are open to being surprised by the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### The "Bee-Cam" Example

Chris Valenzuela, CEO of Runway, shared an example of creative [[experimenting_and_testing_ai_use_cases | exploration]]:
> "I've created this very interesting like uh what i' I think I label it as a bcom is a camera yeah it's a you haven't seen it's a it's a like a firstperson View Camera attached to a bee and you can see the be like flying through like like grass and like different like Landscapes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
This idea was not initially prompted but emerged from iterating with the model, which suggested an unexpected camera angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. This demonstrates the model's ability to create concepts that are either extremely difficult to make conventionally or have never been seen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

### AI as a "Gym for the Mind"
AI tools provide a platform for exercising creative parts of the brain that users might not have previously utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. This applies to both new and experienced creators, fostering a state of flow and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. The goal is not necessarily to become an award-winning artist, but to engage in creative expression for personal satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:15]</a>.

## Product Building in a Rapidly Evolving AI Landscape

In the current state of AI where models are advancing at a rapid pace, the focus for product builders should be on long-term truths and trajectories rather than optimizing for specific short-term points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>.

> "It's less of a focus on particular points I'm more in the line uh where those points are going um because the world will be very different in like 12 months and it will be very extremely different in like 18 months and then figuring out the right system will make a huge difference" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>

The emphasis is on building foundational infrastructure that allows for quick fine-tunings and improvements over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>.

### User Expectations vs. Iterative Process
A common misconception among users, influenced by conversational AI interfaces, is that a single prompt should yield a perfect result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. However, for video and media generation, it is an iterative process requiring multiple prompts, explorations, and refinements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. The true potential is unlocked by spending significant time in this iterative loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

> "You're never going to type in movie Enter and you get this phenomenal two-hour long movie with everything you thought of It's a process you have to go iterate with the tool prompt a few times see where you come with like if you like it or not do it again do it again and spend a lot of time doing that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>

For new users, a helpful approach is to start by recreating tasks they've done in traditional software, using these as creative constraints to guide their initial [[experimenting_and_testing_ai_use_cases | exploration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>.

### The Role of UI and Model Advancements
While UI matters, in a rapidly advancing field like AI, focusing too much on over-engineering the "perfect" UI can be a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>. Better models, even with imperfect UIs, can often "steamroll" highly refined interfaces built on less capable models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>. The ideal future vision is dynamically generated interfaces that adjust based on the user's intent and the specific creative task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>.

### [[Cost_optimization_vs_exploration_in_ai | Cost Optimization vs. Exploration]]
Technology typically moves in two waves: expansion (discovery of possibilities) and optimization (making it efficient and cost-effective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. In the video model space, the industry is still largely in expansion mode, constantly discovering new capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:00">[18:59:00]</a>. For creative AI, "hallucinations" or unexpected outputs are often desirable, opening up a different approach to building models compared to language models where accuracy is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>.

Pricing strategies for AI tools are currently a function of the exploration phase, not the optimization phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:43:00">[40:43:00]</a>. The goal is to set unit economics that allow users to [[experimenting_and_testing_ai_use_cases | explore]] and discover possibilities, rather than immediately optimizing for the lowest price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a>.

## Structuring for Continuous Innovation

Runway's approach combines cutting-edge research with product deployment, fostering a feedback loop where insights from product use inform underlying research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>.

### Collaboration and Unconstrained Research
The "sweet spot" in AI development occurs when individuals who speak the language of art and the language of science can collaborate closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. This means bringing together researchers and artists who can think about what needs to be done in similar ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>.

> "From the research perspective what you want to do is limit your variables and your constraints to a set of predetermined things you can measure but the thing is like in art you don't want to measure too many things in the way you're being perhaps as prescriptive in like science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>

It's crucial to remove preconceptions and allow teams the freedom to "wander" and explore, even if the exact outcome is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>. This environment fosters true innovation and invention, as opposed to marginal improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>.

> "For invention for newness for wondering for doing things that never been done before you don't need a lot of structure you need to find the right people with the right mindset to be able to question everything they've done in the past just feel think first principles think about what's true in the world and then go and experiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[36:37:00]</a>

### Iterative Learning and Embracing Uncertainty
Most things attempted in AI research do not work, but it's through this iterative process of experimentation that teams learn and discover what does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:12:00">[35:12:00]</a>. A key aspect of [[the_bell_labs_approach_to_ai_research_and_development | the Bell Labs approach]] is the comfort with uncertainty; team members might not know what they'll be working on in two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:29:00">[39:29:00]</a>.

> "If you have the right mindset of like it's science you're training stuff you're iterating you're finding things that work then it's going to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:39:00">[35:39:00]</a>

### Evaluation Beyond Benchmarks
While benchmarks are used, evaluation in creative AI heavily relies on "taste" â€“ having experienced individuals with a good understanding of styles and ideas judge the quality and uniqueness of the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[25:19:00]</a>. This subjective assessment is crucial for pushing [[challenges_in_ai_research_and_potential_solutions | research frontiers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>.

## Future Frontiers

Future improvements in video models will come from better scaling, higher quality data (chosen, created, captured, and worked with effectively), and advancements in architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:49:00">[32:49:00]</a>. The most critical unsolved problem is achieving "pixel level control" in generative models, similar to traditional computer graphics tools, which would unlock new levels of fidelity and fine-grain creative aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. This is expected to be achieved within months to a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>.

There is significant untapped potential in using models like Gen-3 Alpha for [[the_role_of_simulation_and_generative_agents_in_ai | simulation systems and engines]], particularly in how models understand fluid and dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:57:00">[53:57:00]</a>. The future of creative AI tools will allow for new perspectives, camera angles, and storytelling aspects that are currently very difficult with traditional filmmaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:12:00">[50:12:00]</a>. When paired with customization and real-time generation, these advancements are expected to lead to entirely new media and art forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:41:00">[50:41:00]</a>.

Defensibility at the application layer in AI refers to the strategies and characteristics that allow a company to maintain a competitive advantage and resist disruption. This contrasts with earlier assumptions about defensibility in AI, which often focused on proprietary data or models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>.

## Key Elements of Defensibility

### 1. Network Effects
Network effects are considered a paramount factor for long-term defensibility at the application layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. Companies that prioritize building a strong multiplayer experience rather than just a single-player one are more likely to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

*   **Example: Chai Research**
    Chai Research, a competitor to Character AI, outlasted its rival by focusing on network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. While Chai Research doesn't possess its own proprietary models, it established a network of people submitting models to be run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>. This marketplace approach, acting as a "choke point" or "protocol layer" between users and model providers, offers long-term robustness despite lacking proprietary IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>.

### 2. Brand and Category Association
The ability to quickly become synonymous with an entire product category provides significant defensibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. This allows companies to secure customer access and can even lead to increased Average Contract Values (ACVs), defying predictions of price compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

### 3. Product Velocity and Breadth
The speed at which a company can develop and expand its product surface area is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. Rapid iteration is essential, especially as new [[AI infrastructure and tooling | models]] are released every few months, creating existential events for companies that fail to adapt quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.

### 4. Utility-Based Monetization
Applications can charge for the utility they provide rather than merely the cost of the underlying [[AI infrastructure and tooling | infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. This allows for higher margins and a more favorable business model compared to [[AI infrastructure and tooling | infrastructure]] providers, whose revenue is often reduced to "cost plus" pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>.

## Contrasting Old and New Views of Defensibility

Historically, defensibility in AI applications was mistakenly associated with owning totally unique data sets or training proprietary models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. However, this has proven to be a "head fake," as the real defensibility lies in the "thousand small things" that contribute to a delightful user experience, strong design, and rapid development speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. This approach is reminiscent of how defensibility is understood in traditional application SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.

### Defensibility in Enterprise Context
While network effects are critical, they can be more challenging to achieve in an enterprise context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. However, the benefits of velocity, product breadth, and brand hold true even in B2B settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.

## Areas Where Defensibility is Emerging

The "first wave" of AI applications often focused on cost-cutting measures, such as automating tasks previously outsourced to Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) firms or managing customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. While these areas found early traction, they may face fierce price competition due to their perceived lower value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

The "next wave" of applications, focusing on top-line revenue generation rather than just cost savings, is expected to be more defensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Outbound Sales:** AI assisting with generating new revenue opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.
*   **Voice AI Applications:** Such as scheduling intake companies, where even partial effectiveness (e.g., 75%) can significantly increase revenue for businesses that previously missed a high percentage of calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.
*   **[[AI applications in legal and education | AI education]]**: Personalised teaching applications that may not be immediately obvious but have significant market opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.
*   **[[AI applications in the legal industry | Finance]]**: AI applications in finance.

These areas allow for a "clean ROI story" where customers are willing to pay a premium for solutions that directly contribute to increased revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

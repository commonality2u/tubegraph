## Overview of [[trust_and_safety_mechanisms_at_heygen | Trust and Safety]]
Confidentiality and safety are considered critical for HeyGen's business, particularly when serving large enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. There are two main areas of focus for this work: creating avatars and creating video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Avatar Creation and Consent
For every avatar created on HeyGen, a video consent format is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **AI Verification** Advanced AI is used to match the consent footage, making it "almost impossible" for individuals to create someone's avatar without their consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Human Review** In addition to AI verification, a moderation team conducts human reviews of the footage to ensure everything is as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Video Content Moderation
HeyGen maintains a platform moderation policy that prohibits certain types of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:
*   Hate speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Misinformation for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Any political campaign or related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

## Hybrid Moderation Approach
HeyGen utilizes a hybrid solution for its moderation efforts, combining AI models with human review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

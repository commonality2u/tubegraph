Haen, an AI video platform, has developed specific [[trust_and_safety_in_aigenerated_content | security guidelines]] concerning voice cloning and AI-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This focus on [[trust_and_safety_in_aigenerated_content | trust and safety]] is considered critical, especially when serving large enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>.

The company's approach to [[trust_and_safety_in_aigenerated_content | trust and safety]] is divided into two main areas:
1.  Creating the avatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>
2.  The video content being created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>

## Avatar Creation Security
For every avatar created on Haen, a video consent format is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **AI Verification** An advanced AI system is used to match the consent video to ensure it is the same person as the footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Passcodes** A dynamically generated passcode system, which expires every 10 to 15 seconds, adds a secure layer of protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. This makes it "almost impossible" for individuals to create someone's avatar without their explicit consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

## Content Moderation Policy
Haen maintains a strict platform moderation policy for all content produced:
*   **Prohibited Content** The platform does not permit hate speech, misinformation, or content related to political campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Review System** Content is reviewed through a hybrid solution that combines AI model reviews with human moderation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. This ensures all content adheres to Haen's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.

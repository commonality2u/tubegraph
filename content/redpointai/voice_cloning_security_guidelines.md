HeyGen, an AI video platform, prioritizes [[trust_and_data_security_in_ai | trust and safety]] in its operations, especially concerning [[voicedriven_humancomputer_interaction | voice cloning]] and avatar creation. This commitment is crucial for serving large enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>.

## Core Pillars of Trust and Safety

HeyGen's approach to [[trust_and_data_security_in_ai | trust and safety]] is divided into two main areas:
1.  Creating user avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>
2.  The content created using the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>

### Avatar Creation Security

To ensure security and prevent unauthorized use, HeyGen implements strict guidelines for avatar creation:

*   **Video Consent Requirement** For every avatar created on HeyGen, a video consent format is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **AI Verification** Advanced AI is used to match the consent video to ensure it's the same person as the provided footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. This makes it almost impossible to create someone's avatar without their consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Passcodes** A dynamically generated passcode, which expires every 10 to 15 seconds, adds an extra layer of security to protect the consent process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Moderation** A dedicated moderation team reviews footage alongside AI models, ensuring everything is as expected during the avatar creation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.

### Content Moderation Policy

HeyGen maintains a strict platform moderation policy to govern the content produced:

*   **Prohibited Content** The platform does not permit hate speech, misinformation, or any political campaign-related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Review System** Content moderation is a hybrid solution involving both AI model review and human moderation to ensure all content complies with HeyGen's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.

## Intellectual Property (IP) Partnerships

HeyGen has existing partnerships with actors who build their avatars on the platform, providing stock avatars for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>. While IP exploration for fictional characters or broader licensing is not a current focus, the ability to generate new voices and AI-generated persons could lead to future IP creation, like [[future_of_voice_ai_and_its_impact | AI influencers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.

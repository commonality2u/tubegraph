HeyGen's core value proposition as a new platform is to "make the camera obsolete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This mission positions HeyGen in contrast to existing vertical video platforms like Snapchat and TikTok.

## Diverging from Incumbent Platforms

Incumbent platforms like Snapchat and TikTok have historically focused on unlocking creators who can easily produce video using a [[impact_of_mobile_cameras_on_video_creation | mobile camera]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Their strategy centers on leveraging the widespread availability and ease of use of smartphone cameras for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. HeyGen, however, aims to move beyond this model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Dilemma for Camera-Based Platforms

A significant challenge for existing mobile platforms arises when [[AIgenerated content versus camerabased content | AI-generated content]] becomes prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. If only 10% of content is currently [[AIgenerated content versus camerabased content | AI-generated]], questions emerge about how to rank and recommend it alongside the 90% of camera-based content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The problem escalates if the ratio shifts to 50% [[AIgenerated content versus camerabased content | AI-generated]] and 50% camera-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In such a scenario, existing content creators relying on cameras might experience a significant decrease in views and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

This potential shift necessitates the creation of new platforms specifically designed for [[AIgenerated content versus camerabased content | AI-generated content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This emerging need represents a key opportunity for new platforms, including HeyGen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intrinsically linked with a massive demand for energy, creating both challenges and opportunities for climate change and technological progress. Mike Schroepfer, former CTO at Facebook and founder of Gigascale, a venture capital firm investing in climate tech, highlights the critical intersection of AI and energy, discussing what is required to produce energy at a scale that can democratize access to AI globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

## The Growing Energy Demands of AI

The buildout of AI compute infrastructure, particularly data centers, necessitates a tremendous amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. An individual AI agent dedicated 24/7 to solving a user's needs would consume a significant amount of power, raising questions about whether it's a kilowatt, megawatt, or terawatt per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. When extrapolated to 8 billion people, the energy demand becomes "crazy fun numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Even without AI, the United States needs to increase its grid capacity by approximately 5 times by 2050 to meet goals such as converting all gas-powered vehicles to EVs and supporting increased manufacturing for materials like steel, cement, and concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. The demand from hyperscalers (large cloud providers and AI companies) is accelerating the need to deploy new energy solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Energy as a Limiting Factor for Progress

Energy is identified as the fundamental rate-limiting step for humanity's forward progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Basic human needs like air conditioning and clean water are fundamentally "power problems," as the technology to provide them exists, but the limiting factor is the cost of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. If energy costs could be reduced by a factor of ten and deployed widely, it would open up the possibility to bring a high standard of living to many more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

AI acts as an accelerator on market forces, driving demand for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The compute demand for AI is increasingly shifting from training models to inference time, where the cost of each request directly impacts demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. Cheaper inference allows for near-infinite demand for reasoning compute, enabling business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. This connection between the cost of energy and the utility of AI makes it imperative to work on energy solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

## Energy Solutions for AI and Climate Change

To meet the escalating energy needs, several approaches are being pursued:

### Existing and Emerging Technologies
*   **Solar**: Currently, 80% of new energy on the US grid in 2024 is utility-grade solar because it's the cheapest way to add new electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. However, solar works only 25% of the time, making it unsuitable for applications requiring 24/7 power, like data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Battery backup can extend solar's utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.
*   **Fusion**: Considered a "magic" solution due to its incredible power density and minimal waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. One super tanker of fuel could power the entire US grid for a year, or a pickup truck could fuel a major power plant for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   **Offshore Compute Platforms**: Companies like Panasa are building 200-meter tall offshore platforms that generate energy from waves and provide immersive cooling for data centers, potentially creating the cheapest inference platform on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **Nuclear and Next-Generation Fission**: Hyperscalers have announced purchase agreements for power from existing or new nuclear plants, with Meta even issuing an RFP for next-generation fission plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
*   **Geothermal**: Investment in next-generation geothermal energy is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.

### AI's Role in Accelerating Energy and Climate Solutions
[[the_role_of_ai_in_fighting_climate_change | AI plays a significant role in fighting climate change]] by addressing critical problems within the energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>:
*   **Exploration**: Companies like Zanar use AI for geothermal exploration, helping to find the best drilling spots for steam or hot water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[00:30:30]</a>. This applies to finding other deposits like copper or hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   **Prediction**: AI can improve weather prediction and risk assessment for insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[00:31:14]</a>.
*   **Materials Discovery**: AI can invent or optimize new materials for applications like carbon capture or catalysts for chemical reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:27:00">[00:31:27]</a>. It helps in searching multi-dimensional spaces to quickly identify materials with desired properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[00:31:37]</a>. This approach is also being applied in pharmaceutical research, such as cancer cure discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Home Efficiency**: AI can assess home energy efficiency. A company founded by Selina Tobak Wala uses AI to process thermal camera videos from phones, providing homeowners with actionable advice on insulation, appliance replacement, and estimated payback times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[00:34:04]</a>. This is a direct application of AI that consumers can easily access and benefit from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:48:00">[00:34:48]</a>.

## Short-Term Challenges and Long-Term Vision
The immediate future (the next five years) regarding energy and AI will be "messy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. To quickly put gigawatts of power on the grid for data centers, gas turbines are a highly effective short-term solution, leading to companies making rational decisions to use natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. This can result in "weird inversions" where new gas assets are added to the grid for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

There is a concern that the promise of "AGI will solve climate change" is a way of "punting the problem down the hill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. Instead, a "walk and chew gum at the same time" approach is needed, combining short-term solutions with long-term planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. This involves quickly building solar, exploring battery backup, and investing in next-generation technologies like geothermal, fission, and fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. These long-term investments are critical enablers for hyperscalers and the continued growth of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

## Broader [[influence_of_ai_on_economics_and_societal_transformation | Societal Transformation]] and [[cost_efficiency_and_accessibility_in_ai_technologies | Cost Efficiency in AI]]

The historical trend of decreasing compute costs has driven technological revolutions, from the internet to mobile and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. This "tailwind of compute capacity" allowed for the use of higher-level programming languages that are less power-efficient per cycle but boost [[ai_models_and_their_impact_on_productivity | programmer productivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Similarly, if energy costs continue to decline by 10% year-over-year for the next 20-30 years, it will lead to "a lot of really amazing things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Universal access to AI compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
*   Air-conditioned comfort for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.
*   The ability to manufacture previously unthinkable products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

The progress in battery technology, specifically lithium-ion batteries, which are 97-98% cheaper than when introduced in 1991 and continue to decrease in cost by over 10% annually, mirrors the cost reduction trends seen in computing chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>. The ability to mass-manufacture standard components (like AA-sized batteries or solar wafers) at scale is the "engine of progress for Humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:15:11]</a>.

Companies like Meta are investing in open-source AI models, such as PyTorch and Llama, to ensure broad [[cost_efficiency_and_accessibility_in_ai_technologies | access to technology]] and foster decentralized innovation and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. This strategy aims to accelerate progress by allowing developers to build on existing work rather than replicating it, leading to faster advancements and more powerful, useful AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>.

## Hardware and Future Development Areas

Hyperscalers are increasingly building their own hardware to optimize their supply chains and reduce costs, especially as GPUs become a significant capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>. While general-purpose chips like Nvidia's are exceptional, specialization in hardware for specific algorithms can yield significant performance-per-watt or price advantages (around 10x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>. However, this requires accurately predicting future algorithms, which is a delicate balance given the rapid pace of AI advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>.

In [[future_development_areas_for_ai_and_efficiency_optimizations | AI advancements]], the focus has shifted from merely scaling up LLMs (which are seeing diminishing returns) to using them as inputs into reasoning models via post-training and reinforcement learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>. Key questions for the next few years include:
*   How much "legs" does this reasoning approach have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>?
*   The development of long-term associative memory, akin to human memory, for LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:46:00">[29:46:00]</a>.
*   Overcoming challenges in domains where verification of AI outputs is difficult, unlike math or coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:00">[29:54:00]</a>.

## The Future of AI in Creative Workflows and Beyond

The potential for [[ai_in_creative_workflows | generative AI]] in virtual reality (VR) is immense, allowing for instantaneous creation of immersive virtual worlds, akin to "The Operator from The Matrix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>. This would overcome the current limitation of content creation in VR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:58:00">[26:58:00]</a>.

Beyond VR, the concept of a "contextual AI" that accompanies a person everywhere, such as through smart glasses, promises transformative experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35:00">[27:35:00]</a>. This AI could offer live translation, interpret menus, act as a tour guide, or help connect with friends and family by sharing memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:45:00">[27:45:00]</a>. This ubiquitous presence of AI is a shift from current interactions, which are typically confined to devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:00">[28:16:00]</a>.

On a personal level, AI is already useful for summarizing complex research papers and generating reports on specialized topics, acting as a "fast tutor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:33:00">[35:33:00]</a>. While current AI models may not always be accurate, they are equivalent to a smart, non-domain-specific human quickly researching a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>. The weirdest prediction for AI's future is that most people will have an AI friend, providing non-judgmental support and always being on their side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:26:00">[42:26:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_ai_on_education_and_unconventional_applications | Impact of AI on Education]] and the CTO Role

The advancing technology emphasizes the importance of fundamentals for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:45:00">[36:45:00]</a>. Critical thinking, basic math, reading, and writing remain crucial, as humans excel at making "gut calls on imperfect data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:02:00">[37:02:00]</a>. Understanding how computers work and how to break down problems are essential skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:08:00">[38:08:00]</a>. The capacity to learn anything by applying one's mind, regardless of initial expertise, is highlighted as a vital skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:32:00">[38:32:00]</a>.

The role of a CTO in an [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_business_models | AI-driven world]] will be more similar than people might think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40:00">[39:40:00]</a>. While AI acts as a "backhoe" to the "shovel" of traditional coding, abstracting away lower-level details and increasing [[ai_models_and_their_impact_on_productivity | programmer productivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:09:00">[40:09:00]</a>, the core responsibility remains consistent: identifying the most important problems to solve and organizing smart humans to tackle them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:47:00">[40:47:00]</a>. AI will enable smaller teams to achieve greater impact, potentially leading to faster growth for companies with fewer people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50:00">[41:50:00]</a>.

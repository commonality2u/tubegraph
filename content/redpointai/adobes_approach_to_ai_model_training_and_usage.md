AI is profoundly transforming creative tooling across images, video, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Scott Belsky, founder of Behance and Chief Product Officer and Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, shared insights into Adobe's strategy regarding artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Core Focus Areas
Adobe's approach to AI is centered around three key areas:
*   **Interfaces** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   **Models** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
*   **Data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>

### The Firefly Family of Models
Adobe's flagship generative models are part of the Firefly family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. These are homegrown and specifically trained on licensed content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Adobe has a compensation program for content contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> and offers blanket indemnification for all its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This ensures compliance and legal protection for users, preventing issues such as generating copyrighted characters like Spider-Man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Integration and Availability
Adobe integrates these models into its existing products like Photoshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. They are also increasingly made available to third parties and large companies for complex, at-scale workflows, aiming to automate tasks that individuals might otherwise perform piecemeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Control Capabilities
A significant focus for Adobe is building "control capabilities" on top of the models, rather than solely pursuing the "next best model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Project Neo**: A 3D illustration program that, unexpectedly, was used by creative professionals to create 3D structures as a reference for [[Adobes integration of AI in content creation | Adobe Firefly]], enabling extreme precision in image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Structure Reference and Style Match**: These capabilities allow users to guide the generative process with greater specificity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Generative Recolor in Illustrator**: This feature allows users to apply hundreds or thousands of color palettes based on prompts to vector creations instantly, a process that previously took days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Custom Models and Data Leverage
Adobe is focused on enabling custom models for its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. For example, Nickelodeon could train a version of Firefly on SpongeBob SquarePants content to generate new ideas for character development and storylines without concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

Adobe leverages its deep understanding of creative tools and user data—such as how users adjust Lightroom dials and filters—to enrich its models and refine outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This "full-stack advantage" allows Adobe to deliver a better end-to-end experience where they are world experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

### Partnerships with LLMs
For Large Language Models (LLMs), Adobe opts for partnerships rather than building their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. These LLMs are surfaced through products like Acrobat, the AI assistant, and digital experience products for marketing analytics and queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Future Directions for [[The future of AI in Adobes products | Adobe AI]]

### UI on Demand
A significant next step is the development of AI that can generate custom user interfaces (UI) on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Instead of a fixed UI, the product would dynamically spin up specific UI elements tailored to the user's current task or prompt, disappearing when no longer needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. This allows for customized experiences for the long tail of specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Professional Grade Quality
Adobe emphasizes the importance of professional-grade quality in its AI outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. For example, while many startups are developing video models, Adobe focuses on specific customer use cases for commercial-grade media creation, where the bar for quality is exceptionally high and outputs "can't look weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

### Proactive Suggestions
Beyond helping users execute tasks, the next tier of AI capability involves proactive suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. This means the AI agent could suggest alternative approaches, identify potential issues, or recommend variations that the user might not have considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

## Business Model: Generative Credits
Adobe uses a generative credit system for its AI features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. Customers receive a basic amount of credits with their existing plans, with options to upgrade for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This model allows Adobe to adjust credit costs for more intensive capabilities (e.g., generative video) while aiming to keep access as cheap as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.

## Evolving Views on AI Models
Initially, Scott Belsky thought only a few models would dominate the AI landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. However, he now believes there will be thousands of models, many of which will become commodities or focus on niche use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. This shift is driven by the rapid increase in model capabilities and the focus on cost-effectiveness for common use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.

Adobe views external frontier models (like Pika or Sora) as platforms, similar to how better chips from Apple improve their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. As long as users need an interface to tell a story, leverage data for customization, and access tools for creative control, Adobe sees itself winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

## The Devil's in the Defaults
A key lesson learned in building [[Challenges and strategies in deploying AI models for developers | AI features]] is that "the devil's in the defaults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. When generative fill and a new generation bar were made default in Photoshop, it "totally unlocked utilization" in an unforeseen way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. The challenge now is to make AI a default part of every product workflow to provide superpowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

[[The Role of AI Agents in Email Management | AI agents]] are particularly effective in scenarios where their capabilities align well with [[role_of_ai_in_general_intelligence_and_application_development | language models]] [00:00:03]. However, their effectiveness diminishes in situations requiring novel planning sequences not present in their training data [00:00:12]. Conversely, [[role_of_ai_in_general_intelligence_and_application_development | AI agents]] excel at tasks that involve various combinations and matches of data seen during their training [00:00:20].

## AI in Email Management

[[The Role of AI Agents in Email Management | Agents]] are highly beneficial for tasks related to email management [00:00:26]. This includes:
*   Answering emails [00:00:27]
*   Labeling emails [00:00:28]

## AI in Debugging and Code Assistance

[[advancements_in_ai_developer_tools | AI agents]] can also provide significant assistance in coding-related tasks, specifically:
*   Adding CSS to HTML [00:00:32]
*   Iteratively debugging common Python problems [00:00:35]

### Limitations in Novel Problem Solving

While [[advancements_in_ai_developer_tools | AI agents]] are strong with familiar patterns, they struggle with truly novel problems [00:00:12]. For instance, [[role_of_ai_in_general_intelligence_and_application_development | agents]] attempting to independently create a research breakthrough or generate new, unpublished algorithms, even simple ones, are unlikely to succeed [00:00:40]. This is because such novel algorithms, by definition, are not present in their training data [00:00:55].

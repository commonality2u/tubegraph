The intersection of [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] and energy is a critical area of focus, as the growing demand for [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] compute capabilities necessitates massive energy build-outs for data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>. This demand, however, is viewed as an opportunity to accelerate the deployment of new, interesting energy solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

Even without [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]], the United States needs to increase its grid capacity by approximately 5x by 2050 to meet goals such as converting all gas-powered vehicles to electric and supporting manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] acts as an accelerator for market forces, pulling forward the opportunity to deploy advanced energy technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The core problem is how to enable 8 billion people to live in comfort and safety, and the answer lies in technology, particularly making energy cheaper and more abundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Access to cheap energy could open up possibilities for everyone to have access to air conditioning, clean water, and other necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Energy Solutions and [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]]
The massive energy consumption required for [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] models, especially for running a dedicated [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] agent for every person, highlights the need for significant advancements in energy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

Current and future energy solutions include:
*   **Solar** Solar power is currently the cheapest way to add new electrons to the grid, accounting for 80% of new energy on the U.S. grid in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. However, it only operates about 25% of the time, making it less ideal for continuous power needs like data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Fusion** Fusion is highlighted as a promising energy source due to its incredible power density and lack of waste concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. Theoretically, one super tanker could fuel the entire United States grid for a year with fusion power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **Offshore Compute Platforms** Companies like Panasa are developing offshore compute platforms that combine energy generation (harnessing wave power) with immersive cooling from the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. These could potentially become the cheapest inference platforms globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Batteries** Lithium-ion batteries have seen a 97-98% cost reduction since their introduction in 1991 and continue to decrease in cost by over 10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.
*   **Hyperscaler Investments** Major technology companies ("hyperscalers") are actively engaging with energy providers, announcing purchase agreements for existing and new nuclear power plants, and issuing RFPs for next-generation fusion plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Energy is now a major conversation point, moving from being an afterthought to a critical component for powering [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] training and, increasingly, inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

## [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] and Climate Change
There is a tension between the immediate energy demands of [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] and long-term climate goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Some in the [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] community believe that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will eventually solve climate change, downplaying the short-term impact of using natural gas for data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. However, this perspective is seen as "punting the problem down the hill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

In the short term (next five years), the energy landscape for [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] will be "messy," with many companies making rational decisions to use combined cycle gas turbines for power due to their effectiveness in providing consistent energy quickly, even if it means increased carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. These companies often purchase carbon offsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. The U.S. energy generation shows coal decreasing, replaced by gas, with solar growing rapidly at the bottom of the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

It is crucial to pursue short-term solutions while also planning for the long term, investing in next-generation technologies like battery backup for solar, advanced geothermal, and fusion to pull these technologies forward and enable a sustainable energy future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:17]</a>.

## Applications of [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] to Climate Issues
[[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] can be applied to solve critical climate problems in several ways:
*   **Exploration** For example, in geothermal exploration, [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] can analyze data to identify optimal drilling locations where hot water or steam emerges, rather than relying on extensive physical drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>. This approach can also be used to find deposits of other resources like copper or hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a>.
*   **Prediction and Risk Assessment** [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] can improve weather prediction and risk assessment for industries like insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>.
*   **Materials Discovery and Optimization** [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] can invent or optimize new materials for applications such as carbon capture or catalysts for chemical reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a>. This involves searching multi-dimensional spaces to find materials with specific properties more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>. While [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] excels at discovery, scaling up the manufacturing of these new materials remains a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>.
*   **Home Efficiency and Comfort** [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] can assist consumers in improving home efficiency and comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>. By using a thermal camera with a phone, [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] can process videos of a house and generate reports recommending energy-saving actions like adding insulation or replacing appliances, with clear payback periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>. This is a direct application of [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI]] that simplifies complex evaluations for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:48:00">[34:48:00]</a>.

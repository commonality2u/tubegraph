Logan Kilpatrick, the first AI hire at OpenAI, discussed various future trends in AI and the evolving landscape of multimodal models and their applications.

## Multimodal AI: The Next Frontier
Kilpatrick stated that the "next year is the year of multimodal" AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. While still in early stages for vision use cases, there's a strong belief that the technology will significantly advance. Current vision models, akin to "GPT 3.5 Vision era," need to achieve a more detailed understanding of the positional relationship between objects in an image to unlock a wider range of robust applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, similar to the jump in capabilities seen from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Examples of future multimodal capabilities include:
*   **Enhanced Design Tools** The ability to reformat designs in applications like Canva, where the model perfectly understands spatial relationships and allows for editable, movable objects like titles, is a desired future state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>.
*   **Improved Document Processing** Current OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on models like GPT-4V, while capable, can miss structural details in spreadsheets or receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.
*   **Generative Art and Design** The ability to sketch art and have generative image models create complete pieces, allowing users to explore creative possibilities beyond their artistic skills, is seen as empowering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. The success of tools like TLDraw, which converts user drawings into functional apps, exemplifies the potential of these models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>.

## Evolution of AI Models and Infrastructure
Kilpatrick foresees several key evolutions in AI model development and infrastructure:

### Assistance API and GPTs
The [[applications_and_implications_of_multimodal_ai_models | Assistance API]] is predicted to be a significant long-term development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Unlike plugins, GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) overcome security and privacy challenges, allowing seamless integration of browsing, code interpreter, and custom actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. The upcoming GPT store will also address discoverability issues previously seen with plugins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

### Custom Models
While base models will continue to improve and become more steerable, there will always be a need for [[role_of_synthetic_data_and_multimodal_systems_in_ai_development | custom AI models]], particularly for specialized domains like legal or medical where companies possess unique, high-quality data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. These custom models can be more compute-efficient by removing unnecessary data from training sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The challenge is making custom model training more accessible and affordable, moving beyond the current multi-million dollar cost and requirement for billions of tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Prompt Engineering and Communication
Kilpatrick believes that the "death of prompt engineering" is coming, as models will evolve to better understand and translate user requests, similar to how DALL-E 3 revises prompts in ChatGPT to achieve desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. The core of prompt engineering is effective communication, and future models will reduce the friction for users to articulate their needs concisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

### The Future of Interfaces and Agents
There's a strong desire for AI assistants to be integrated into existing workflows, such as text messaging and email, rather than requiring users to visit new websites or applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. This approach minimizes the need to re-educate users on new interfaces, as seen with Microsoft's Co-pilot strategy integrating AI into their existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.

Regarding [[role_of_ai_models_in_advancing_robotics_and_autonomous_driving | AI agents]], their widespread adoption depends on significant "Internet infrastructure work" to authenticate humans versus AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. This is critical to ensure responsible use and prevent misuse, as models could potentially bypass human verification methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. Companies like Apple and Google may need to form a consortium to develop open standards for AI agent interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities for AI Development
### Reliability and Latency
Two major [[limitations_of_current_ai_models_and_future_architecture | limitations of current AI models]] for enterprise adoption are robustness/reliability and latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>. Enterprises often need to use third-party tools (e.g., guardrails) to ensure confidence in production environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. Latency, where users wait several seconds for a response, needs significant improvement to match the speed of human thought and creative flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

### Observability and Evaluation
Kilpatrick highlights observability as an underhyped aspect of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. Developers need better tools to monitor and understand how AI models are being used, similar to the detailed dashboards offered by platforms like Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

A critical unmet need in the AI space is a robust solution for model evaluation ("evals") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. With rapid model iteration cycles, users struggle to determine if a new model truly improves their specific use cases without extensive human time for evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. While difficult to automate, understanding failure points through eval processes is crucial for learning and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

### Competition and Open Source
The emergence of models like Google Gemini is viewed positively, pushing innovation across the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. While OpenAI aims for its models to consistently outperform [[the_future_of_ai_models_and_open_source_development | open-source AI models]] due to resource intensity and engineering, open-source options offer greater control over weights and deeper customization through fine-tuning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. However, the accessibility and reduced operational burden of using an API (avoiding GPU allocation, setup) provide significant value for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## Advice for AI-Curious Individuals
For those overwhelmed by the rapid pace of AI, Kilpatrick advises:
1.  **Identify Pain Points** Audit daily tasks or job responsibilities that are disliked or where personal improvement is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:24">[00:54:24]</a>.
2.  **Integrate AI into Workflow** Make it a habit to consult AI tools first for tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.
3.  **Developers Must Use AI** Developers not using tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot are at a disadvantage, as AI can significantly amplify their capabilities and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>.
4.  **Seek Real-World Examples** Find and share stories of how top professionals in various fields are using AI tools to inspire others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>.

Ultimately, the future of AI involves greater integration into everyday applications and workflows, driven by improvements in model capabilities and the development of accessible, reliable platforms.

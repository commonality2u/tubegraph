Trust and safety are considered critical for HeyGen's business, especially since they serve large [[enterprise_customer_service_at_heygen | Enterprise customers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Their work in this area focuses on two main aspects: the creation of avatars and the video content produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Avatar Creation Safety

To ensure trust and prevent misuse, HeyGen implements strict measures for avatar creation:

*   **Consent Requirement** Every avatar created on HeyGen requires a video consent format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **AI Verification** The platform utilizes advanced AI to match the consent footage with the person creating the avatar, making it "almost impossible" to create someone's avatar without their consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Human Moderation** In addition to AI review, a dedicated [[ai_and_human_moderation_at_heygen | human moderation team]] conducts reviews of the footage to ensure everything is as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Content Moderation

HeyGen maintains a platform moderation policy to govern the video content created:

*   **Prohibited Content** The policy disallows content such as hate speech, misinformation targeting children, and any political campaign or related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Solution** Content moderation employs a [[ai_and_human_moderation_at_heygen | hybrid solution]] combining AI models and human review to enforce these policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

In the coming decade, search technology is expected to transform into a system that provides direct answers and agents capable of completing tasks, mimicking conversational interactions with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This evolution moves beyond mere links to comprehensive, concise answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

## Perplexity AI's Vision for Search

Perplexity AI, a "next-gen search product," aims to maximize "knowledge velocity" â€“ the rate at which knowledge is acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This contrasts with older platforms like Quora and Wikipedia, which focused on maximizing knowledge itself but lacked speed or personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Perplexity's goal is to fulfill all human curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

### Key Dimensions of a Successful Search Product
Perplexity AI focuses on five critical dimensions to deliver a top-tier product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:
*   **Accuracy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   **Reliability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   **Latency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   **Delightful User Experience (UX)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   **Iterative Improvement**: Constantly enhancing for everyone or through personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Evolution of Search Results and Interaction
Modern search goes beyond simple text:
*   **Multimodal Answers**: Answers should not be limited to text. Images are "worth a thousand words," and videos are "worth tens of thousands of words," making them crucial for accompanying search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Sharability**: Answers should be sharable entities, such as permalinks, so others can benefit without re-asking the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This innovation was adopted by competitors like Bing and ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Follow-up Questions**: Search engines should suggest follow-up questions because humans are not always good at articulating their curiosity into precise queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **AI-Assisted Query Formulation (Copilot)**: Instead of blaming users for poor "prompt engineering," tools like Perplexity's Copilot assist in refining questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The philosophy is "the user is never wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The ideal scenario is for AI to magically know when to clarify or dig deeper, without users having to pick a mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
*   **Personalization**: Future search will cater to individual depth preferences, such as a high-level overview of black holes versus detailed celebrity gossip, or vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This "fast, high bandwidth access to knowledge" is a core tenet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

## Challenges and Strategy in AI-Powered Search
Perplexity AI views search as a "vertical" within the broader context of AI chatbots, and focusing on knowledge and research within that is another vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

### Competing with Incumbents
Challengers to dominant search engines like Google often fail by trying to replicate Google's exact approach (crawler, indexer, ranker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. Successful challengers, like DuckDuckGo and Brave, found unique positioning (privacy, crypto) and focused on "go-to-market and market positioning and branding" rather than building technology from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

The emergence of powerful models like GPT-4, and their accessibility via APIs, created a rare "moment" where Google was not the leader in AI, providing an opportunity for new players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.

### The Role of Models and Vertical Integration
Perplexity's strategy has evolved from using off-the-shelf models to fine-tuning smaller, faster models, and eventually releasing their own [[the_future_of_ai_models_and_open_source_development | open-source models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. They advise product-focused companies to start with existing models to achieve product-market fit quickly, rather than immediately investing in model building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Perplexity aims to be "model agnostic" but retains the option to control its destiny if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. The user's primary concern is getting the best answer, not which model powers it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Addressing Hallucinations with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Perplexity has been highly effective at using RAG to combat hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. However, solving RAG for web search is different from solving it for internal enterprise search, as indexing, embeddings, and snippet generation vary significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Throwing more information at long-context models can even increase hallucination chances, emphasizing the need for robust retrieval, indexing, and ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

## Product Development and Growth
Perplexity made a crucial pivot to consumer-facing search when internal tools, designed for self-use, generated unexpected excitement among early users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. A key virality moment occurred when their Twitter search product summarized public social media activity, leading to users sharing screenshots of their own profiles, akin to ChatGPT's screenshot virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

Optimizing for new users is crucial for growth, even over catering to power users who might demand specific features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. Products that are unintuitive or blast users with too many sign-up modals tend to stifle growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

### The Future of Voice Interfaces
While some envision future search being entirely voice-to-voice, there's a concern about AI "rambling," as eyes can read answers faster than ears can hear them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. Conciseness is key for effective voice interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

### [[Future of AI avatars | Future AI Applications]] and [[The future of AI platforms in content creation | Content Creation]]
Beyond traditional search, AI will enable new forms of interaction and content creation. The ability to record loved ones' voices and personalities to interact with them in the future is a personal project aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. Similarly, reducing the marginal cost of creating movies and visualizations through generative AI tools could lead to an abundance of "amazing" content that explains concepts better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This also ties into [[Future trends in AI and multimodal models | multimodal reasoning]] and [[Future of coding and AI integration | generative user interfaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

Arvind, CEO of Perplexity AI, shared a poignant example of how [[the_future_of_ai_in_human_communication | AI]] can be used to preserve the memories of loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. He expressed a personal project: to record his parents as much as possible, specifically through podcast interviews about their lives, so he could "talk to them again" even if they were no longer present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>.

## Envisioning AI-Powered Personal Interaction
The development of realistic voices and [[the_future_of_ai_in_human_communication | AIs that can talk exactly like humans]] is seen as amazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>. This capability could extend beyond direct conversation, allowing for interactions such as typing a congratulatory message and having it spoken in a loved one's voice, even if they are not around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Ethical Considerations
The concept of using generative speech and video models to interview parents and preserve their essence "through time" evokes strong reactions, including goosebumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:54">[01:04:54]</a>. While this vision holds potential benefits, it also raises questions about its overall impact on the world, with some comparing it to a "Black Mirror" episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.

This "crazy vision" is seen as a natural extension of current technology, particularly with the advancements in generating video, sound, and voices, heading towards a future where such persistence is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. The broader application of these tools, including in [[future_of_generative_models_in_media | AI-generated movies]], could drastically reduce the marginal cost of creation, leading to a future where amazing visualizations and illustrations can be made to explain concepts better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.

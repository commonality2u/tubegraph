Haehn's platform moderation policy is critical for its business, especially when serving large enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The policy addresses two main areas: creating avatars and managing the video content produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Authenticity and Consent for Avatars
For every avatar created on Haehn, a video consent format is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. An advanced AI system is used to match the consent footage, making it "almost impossible" for individuals to create someone's avatar without their consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Beyond AI detection, a human moderation team also conducts reviews of the footage to ensure everything is as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Prohibited Content
The platform moderation policy explicitly prohibits certain types of content on Haehn's platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:
*   Hate speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Misinformation, especially concerning children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Any political campaign or related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

## Approach to Moderation
The moderation system utilizes a [[hybrid_solutions_for_content_moderation | hybrid solution]] that combines AI models with human review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This dual approach helps enforce the platform's guidelines and ensures content adheres to the established policies.

Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, CEO of Grammarly, discusses the transformative impact of AI on communication and productivity, drawing from Grammarly's extensive experience as an AI writing assistant with over 30 million daily active users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## A Vision for AI in Communication

The future of communication, enabled by AI, is envisioned as more meaningful and connection-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. AI is expected to eliminate the "drudgery" of day-to-day work, allowing humans to concentrate on creativity, synthesizing ideas, and deeper human connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Rahul hopes for a future with less email and fewer documents, where the goal is not to create more content volume, but to make existing communication better, more memorable, and precise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This contrasts with the current reality where the average person switches contexts 1,200 times in a workday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. AI should enable individuals to enter a "flow state" and focus on their strengths, making each conversation measurably more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

It's crucial for humans to have agency in shaping this future, avoiding a dystopian scenario where AI generates and consumes most content, as writing and communicating are fundamental to human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Grammarly's Product Evolution

Grammarly, founded in 2009, has evolved through various technology waves, from rules-based systems and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to deep learning models and now Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI (GenAI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The company focuses on solving user needs by applying the most suitable technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Communication can be viewed in four stages:
1.  **Ideation/Conceptualization**: Thinking about what to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
2.  **Composition**: Writing down the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
3.  **Revision**: Polishing and improving the text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
4.  **Comprehension**: The recipient understanding the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Historically, Grammarly primarily focused on the revision phase, helping with correctness, adherence to style guides, tone, and brevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

With LLMs, Grammarly is expanding its capabilities in two main ways:
1.  **Tying communication to business outcomes**: Suggestions will become more strategically aligned with desired results. Correctness and tone adjustments will often be auto-applied, allowing users to focus on achieving goals, such as adding a "call to action" to an email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
2.  **Supporting the entire communication lifecycle**: Grammarly will assist users from ideation and composition through revision and comprehension (e.g., summarizing long email threads and identifying action items) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Developing AI Features

Grammarly approaches AI development with a strong emphasis on quality and safety due to the critical nature of user communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This requires significant work beyond just "throwing a model over the wall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

Key aspects of their development process:
*   **Fine-tuning**: Models are fine-tuned for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Evals**: Extensive quality and safety evaluations are conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **User Feedback Loop**: User acceptance/rejection of suggestions and engagement levels provide critical quality input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Human Experts**: Side-by-side evaluations by linguistic experts compare model outputs to human-idealized text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Experiments**: Features are initially rolled out to small percentages of users as asset tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

Accuracy requirements vary by context; unlike marketing content where hallucinations might be acceptable, sensitive communications demand high precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. One example of learning from user feedback was the tone detector, which sometimes made inappropriate suggestions for sensitive documents like police reports, leading to suppression rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Best Practices for AI Tool Adoption
Effective users of AI tools like Grammarly understand that communication is a strategic imperative linked to personal and organizational goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. For instance, ModMed, an e-health company, uses Grammarly strategically to improve patient outcomes through enhanced communication in sensitive documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. The key is to define the goal and measure how the AI solution helps achieve it, moving beyond the "cool factor" of new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Response to LLM Advancements

The release of ChatGPT was a watershed moment, surprising many with its speed, scale, and pace of quality improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Grammarly views this as a significant enabler for its mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. As domain experts in communication, they harness the latest technology to provide the best solutions for user problems, adapting from rules-based NLP (which couldn't support ideation) to current LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. While earlier LLMs showed lower precision than NLP for grammar, the quality improvements have been phenomenal, with LLMs now being as good as rule-based systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

## Product Roadmap and Challenges

When building with rapidly evolving AI models, Grammarly focuses on solving current user problems and upholding its brand promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Safety, for example, is a non-negotiable aspect that requires continuous work, even if models improve in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

Areas of exploration and future development include:
*   **On-device inference**: As models become more efficient, moving inference to the edge can improve security, privacy, latency, and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. This is expected to become broadly viable by next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.
*   **Multi-step reasoning and agentic workflows**: Future models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning will enable Grammarly to orchestrate elaborate communication flows (e.g., assisting with drafting a comprehensive board email by pulling in various contexts and applying domain expertise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. This aims to reduce the "drudgery" of cutting and pasting context, promoting a flow state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.
*   **Idiosyncratic Models**: Different LLMs behave uniquely, requiring significant work to make each model fit for purpose, rather than being simply "plug and play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.
*   **Model Orchestration**: Grammarly uses a combination of half a dozen or so closed and open-source models in production, mostly fine-tuned on user data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. The goal is to distill models to the smallest, most efficient size for each use case without compromising quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. Cost and latency are significant considerations, especially for a large user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

Grammarly's competitive advantage lies in its vast repository of relevant, contextual, and high-quality user data, processing 75 billion user events daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. This data is used to fine-tune models and personalize experiences. They enable users to fine-tune their personal voice and assist organizations in enforcing style guides, brand tones, and corporate values across internal and external communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This can automate compliance with strict communication rules, like those for loan officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

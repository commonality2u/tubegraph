DeepL, a company recently valued at $2 billion, supports over 100,000 businesses globally with AI translation services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Yerkoyski, CEO and founder of DeepL, discussed how the company has become a leader in the AI translation space, particularly in competition with giants like Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## DeepL's Journey and Competitive Edge
DeepL has been engaged in cutting-edge AI research long before it became a mainstream topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The release of ChatGPT was a significant moment for the company, as it brought widespread public awareness to the capabilities of AI, specifically language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. DeepL views competition, particularly with Google Translate, as beneficial, as it drives innovation and leads to better outcomes for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This competitive drive fostered a sense of urgency within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Yerkoyski attributes DeepL's success against larger competitors like Google to several key factors:
*   **Speed to Market and Continuous Innovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Strong Academic Research Combined with Company Building** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Specialization** on high-value translation use cases for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Geographic Advantage**: Being established in Europe, a region with many different languages, provided the team with a deep understanding and motivation to solve complex translation problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### The "Build It Yourself" Philosophy
DeepL maintains a "build it yourself" approach, owning the entire vertical stack from product development to engineering and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This includes building their own models and tooling, and even operating their own data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This vertical integration allows them to better understand and solve customer problems by controlling all model parameters, training, and architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

One example of this feedback loop between application and model is the ability for customers to embed terminology directly into the models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This crucial feature allows businesses to control the language used in their documents and manuals, even handling grammatical rules and contextual meanings for specific words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

DeepL uses different sets of models depending on language pairs and data availability, sometimes grouping similar languages or bundling models for operational efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. They prioritize smaller, more efficient models for individual language pairs, especially given the scale of their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Role of Human Expertise
Human data and translators play an increasingly vital role in DeepL's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. They conduct extensive in-house data annotation projects with human translators to train models and perform quality assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This is particularly important for specialized models where customer expectations for consistent quality are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. They hire native speakers globally to ensure the highest quality of translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. While they currently do data labeling in-house, they are considering outsourcing parts of it in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The decision to keep it in-house stems from the need for control and high quality, especially for tasks where specific individual expertise is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

## Current State and Future of AI Translation
AI translation has advanced significantly, especially for well-resourced language pairs like German-English, where a lot of training data is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Use cases such as automatically translating newspaper articles or one-to-one communication like emails are considered largely "solved" for these languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.

However, for high-stakes applications like publishing a marketing website for a billion-dollar company or creating operating manuals for nuclear power plants, human-in-the-loop oversight is still recommended to ensure accuracy and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.

### The Next Frontier: Spoken Language Translation
The next major frontier for DeepL is spoken language and voice translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. While AI-based text translation has revolutionized how content from abroad is consumed, synchronous speech translation for conversations is still a developing area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>. DeepL is conducting its own research to bring this to a usable product integrated everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

The widespread availability of real-time, ubiquitous translation models for speaking could dramatically change business operations, allowing for seamless communication across different languages and locations, potentially bridging geographical distances for co-founders and teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. It would also democratize access to education, learning resources, and knowledge across linguistic barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.

The main [[challenges_and_advancements_in_ai_technology | challenges]] for synchronous speaking models include latency and the inherent ambiguity and unstructured nature of spoken language compared to text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. Teaching models to translate different types of spoken language is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

### Impact on Language Learning
Regarding [[the_future_of_ai_in_human_communication | the future of AI in human communication]] and [[ai_language_learning_platforms | AI language learning platforms]], while AI could make learning to speak a language less expensive and more accessible by providing fluent conversation partners, the personal and cultural value of learning languages will likely remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. Although the average person might learn fewer languages in the future due to advanced translation tools, those who do will pursue it out of personal interest and intellectual challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.

### Moats and Defensibility in AI
DeepL believes that specialized models are significantly more defensible than general models, especially for large, critical use cases like translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. While general AI models can do "everything," getting them to perform reliably and seamlessly for specific tasks is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. The company has found that a model specifically trained and refined for translation, with good labeled reinforcement learning, outperforms a general model for this task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

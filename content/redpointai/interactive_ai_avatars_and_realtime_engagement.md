Hajen, an AI video platform, has developed an interactive avatar beta version that allows users to send their avatars to participate in real-time engagements such as Zoom meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

## Technical Challenges and Future Prospects
Achieving real-time interaction with AI avatars presents significant technical challenges, primarily concerning performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. As AI models become larger and their architectures more complex, optimizing inference speed is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

Despite these hurdles, Hajen's CEO, Joshua, is optimistic that much of this technology will be able to run in real-time within 12 months, with some capabilities even becoming available on-device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. This advancement would unlock a "whole new use cases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

### Personalized User Experiences
One significant potential use case for real-time AI avatars is in advertising, where personalized video ads could be generated on-the-fly based on a user's preferences or watch history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Currently, even with different ad recommendations, users often see the same video from a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Real-time generation would allow for dynamic content tailored to individual consumers, dramatically improving the customer experience by integrating with existing CRM and go-to-market tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. This aligns with the broader trend of [[using_ai_for_personalized_user_experiences]].

## Customer Feedback and AI Quality
Hajen's focus on [[evaluating_ai_systems_and_managing_humanai_collaboration | AI quality]] is paramount for business video, as it directly impacts engagement and message delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Customers, particularly in enterprise settings, have a high expectation for brand consistency and video output quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

Joshua noted that customers pay "how detail" attention to avatar quality, especially when viewing their *own* avatar, setting a "much higher bar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. Specific feedback highlights challenges in maintaining consistent and natural body gestures in longer videos, where the avatar's movements might randomly deviate from the script towards the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. This detailed feedback underscores the ongoing need to improve the performance of streaming avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

## Broader Implications for [[future_of_ai_avatars]]
The development of engaging, real-time AI avatars is expanding use cases beyond traditional learning and development to areas like marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. The ability to generate new, persistent AI-driven characters could also lead to the creation of future intellectual properties (IPs), such as AI influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.

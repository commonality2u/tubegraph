The AI landscape is characterized by rapid development and a future that is difficult to predict with certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. However, some trends and potential future applications, particularly in the realm of personalization, are beginning to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

## Personalization: A Key Future Trend
Personalization at a user level is considered a crucial element for AI applications to truly take off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:44:00">[53:44:00]</a>. The ability to dynamically render content and tailor it based on the individual user is seen as a significant underexplored angle for many applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Current State of Personalization
> The speaker notes that companies like [[Vision for the future of AIpowered content personalization | New Computer]] by Sam Whitmore and Hearth AI are actively exploring personalization in their applications, focusing on memory and relationship management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:52:00">[52:52:00]</a>.

### Potential Personalized AI Applications
*   **Personalized Sports Commentary:** Generating commentary for sports that is personalized to the viewer, for instance, by referencing their past viewing habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   **Journaling Apps with Memory:** A journal application that remembers personal details about the user from their entries and past interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:01:00">[55:01:00]</a>. This contrasts with current models that struggle with long-term memory, like Character AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:22:00">[55:22:00]</a>.
*   **Tailored Knowledge Bases:** Applications like Notion QA are already providing personalized chat over a user's knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. In the future, this could extend to services like Perplexity, where search answers are tailored to individual user interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

## Emerging Application Archetypes
Beyond personalized chat, several other types of AI applications are expected to become more prevalent:

*   **More Complex Chatbots:** These bots would be designed as state machines with different stages, such as customer support bots that transition through various debugging steps, or AI therapists with defined conversational stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:55:00">[41:55:00]</a>.
*   **Longer Running Jobs:** Applications that perform more complicated tasks requiring multiple Large Language Model (LLM) calls and self-correction, taking minutes rather than seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:19:00">[42:19:00]</a>. Examples include GPT researcher for generating research reports or GPT newsletter for creating first drafts of articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:24:00">[42:24:00]</a>.
*   **AI-Native User Experiences (UX):** There is significant innovation to be done in how people interact with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:27:00">[43:27:00]</a>. An example is an AI-native spreadsheet where each cell is populated by a separate agent, running multiple agents in parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>. This model allows for inspection of results after a task is completed, rather than continuous interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:33:00">[44:33:00]</a>.

## Role of Open Source Models
Open-source models are expected to become more ubiquitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:58:00">[51:58:00]</a>. While proprietary models like OpenAI are currently preferred for complex tasks, there is strong interest in local models and agents that can run on user devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:05:00">[52:05:00]</a>. This trend is driven by the desire for local processing of personalized or sensitive data, such as private documents or coaching personas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:16:00">[52:16:00]</a>.

## Obviated Concepts in AI Development
As [[Challenges and advancements in AI technology | AI models]] improve, some current practices may become less necessary:

*   **Context Window Management:** With larger context windows in future LLMs, some "tricks" for managing conversation history and summarizing previous turns might become obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:01:00">[46:01:00]</a>.
*   **Manual Structured Output:** The need for prompts that explicitly instruct models to "write this in JSON or poppy" is hoped to disappear with better [[Trends in AI model training and deployment | function calling]] and structured extraction capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:32:00">[48:32:00]</a>.
*   **Some Multimodal Limitations:** While currently overhyped for precise knowledge work, multimodal models are expected to improve their spatial awareness and extraction capabilities, enabling more sophisticated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:11:00">[49:11:00]</a>.

However, certain aspects like [[Challenges and opportunities in AI integration | retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)]] and the state machine mental model for agents are likely to persist due to their inherent utility and clarity for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:14:00">[47:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05:00">[48:05:00]</a>.

## Advice for Startups
For startups building in AI, the advice is to prioritize building and achieving product-market fit (PMF) over concerns about cost optimization or future technological shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:08:00">[45:08:00]</a>. "No GPUs before PMF" emphasizes using existing powerful models like GPT-4 to validate ideas before investing heavily in custom model training or infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:42:00">[45:42:00]</a>. The space is still early, and the focus should be on building applications and gaining a deep understanding of how users interact with these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

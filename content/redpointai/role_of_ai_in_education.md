Princeton Professor Arvin Duran discusses the [[future_of_ai_in_education | future of AI in education]], highlighting its potential and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. He emphasizes the need to differentiate between hype and substance in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Current State and Adoption
While many assume students are expert users of generative AI, many are often confused and hesitant, primarily viewing it as a cheating tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. Educators, like Professor Duran, are encouraging students to use AI more productively and to understand its potential benefits despite issues like hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

A recent paper titled "The Rapid Adoption of Generative AI" indicated that 40% of people use generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. However, this adoption is at a low intensity, with users spending only half an hour to three hours per week on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. This suggests that generative AI adoption might be slower than PC adoption when accounting for intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. One reason for this could be that AI is not yet as immediately useful to many people as word processing was with early PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

## Policy and Curriculum Implications
There is significant "low-hanging fruit" for policy interventions to improve AI's utility in education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. For instance, policies could make it easier for teachers to upskill themselves and then teach these AI skills to students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. Integrating AI literacy into the curriculum, from college down to K-12, could help students use it productively and avoid pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. In classes, students are encouraged to use AI tools, but must disclose how they used them, allowing for feedback and guidance on effective usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

## Future of Education with AI
The fundamental nature of education is unlikely to change drastically, even with widespread AI integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. The excitement around online courses over a decade ago, which predicted a shift in education, was based on the false premise that education's value lay solely in information transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. The true value of classroom learning lies in creating social preconditions for learning, such as motivation, connections, caring, and individualized feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.

### [[impact_of_ai_on_teachers_and_students | Impact of AI on Students and Inequality]]
The [[impact_of_ai_on_teachers_and_students | impact of AI on the next generation]] will likely have high variance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. Similar to social media, AI can be negative if not monitored, but enormously positive if parents have the time and resources to supervise usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.

Professor Duran shares personal examples of using AI to build simple learning apps for his children, such as:
*   A phonics app to break down words into sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.
*   An app using Claude's artifacts feature to generate random clock faces for teaching time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. These apps are quickly created and can be disposable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.

It is predicted that children will use AI in much bigger ways for their learning, likely mostly outside of traditional schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. Schools tend to be "jittery" about new technologies like devices and AI, which could lead to significant disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. Wealthier children with parents who can monitor and integrate AI into their learning in healthy ways will likely benefit more, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. This also raises concerns about AI addiction, which can be highly personalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

### Chatbots as Future Information Access
There's a prediction that companies will train users, especially younger generations, to expect chatbots as the primary way of accessing any kind of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>. This represents a significant shift from current methods of searching and clicking on websites, which for future generations might feel akin to going to a library for current generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. This future necessitates preparing users with tools for fact-checking when necessary, given the statistical and potentially hallucinatory nature of chatbots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

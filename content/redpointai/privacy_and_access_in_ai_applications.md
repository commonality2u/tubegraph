The effective deployment of AI agents in enterprise settings necessitates extensive access to company data, which introduces unique challenges related to privacy, custom integration, and the need for robust guardrails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Data Access and Privacy Concerns
AI agents, designed to drive automation, require access to the same information humans use to perform their jobs effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This includes sensitive data such as emails, chat logs, call records, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and human resources (HR) software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Such a high degree of access presents significant privacy challenges, making it a much larger issue for AI and agents compared to other types of enterprise software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

The risks associated with mistakes, especially concerning sensitive information like salary data, customer data, or patient data, are exceptionally high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Therefore, a substantial amount of guardrails is necessary to prevent errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Customization and Integration Challenges
A significant hurdle in enterprise AI adoption is the lack of a standardized software setup across companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Each organization uses a unique "tapestry or mosaic" of software, necessitating a degree of custom setup to gather all relevant context and integrate it into the AI model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. While AI agents might eventually automate some of this complexity, a middle ground is likely, where parts of the problem are automated but full self-service setup remains a "little bit fantasy" for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Cohere's agent platform, North, focuses on making customization and integration easier, adapting to the diverse software environments of different companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The platform allows for customization of the user interface, branding, data connections, data sources, and tools the model can use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. It even supports plugging in other fine-tuned models, such as Llama, to expose them through the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

## Custom Models and Data Specialization
While general models are powerful, there is still a need for custom models to address fundamental context missing from models trained solely on web data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Information not readily available on the web, such as manufacturing data, customer transactions, or detailed personal health records, necessitates specialized training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

Cohere partners with organizations possessing this specific data to create custom models accessible only to them, making the models highly effective in those particular domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This approach is crucial because, while general models can perform well, they lack the specific domain knowledge that specialized data provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Although synthetic data has considerably closed this gap, human data remains essential for tasks like evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Industry Trends and Future Outlook
The current landscape of enterprise AI adoption sees a "scattershot phase" where different teams acquire various niche applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. However, this is expected to lead to consolidation, as managing disparate applications with extensive data source connections becomes an "insane maintenance burden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. The long-term vision involves a single platform, like North, that is plugged into everything to handle all automation objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

The ability for models to learn from experience and user interaction is a critical future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. Currently, models forget feedback after a chat session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. Enabling models to learn and adapt based on continuous user input would unlock significant capabilities, fostering a stronger connection between the user and the AI system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. This could transform models from "new interns" to personalized "me 2.0" agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>. This personalized learning would likely involve storing interaction history in a queryable database, providing constant context to the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

Regarding [[approaches_to_ai_safety_and_alignment | AI safety]], while concerns about potential misuse by bad actors, especially at the state level, are valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>, the focus should remain on mitigating near and midterm risks rather than "doomsday scenarios" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a>. The focus should be on ensuring that liberal democracies have early access to the technology to establish an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>, and on establishing infrastructure for retraining individuals whose jobs may be impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.# Privacy and Access in AI Applications

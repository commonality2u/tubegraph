While [[limitations_of_current_ai_models_and_future_architecture | AI agents]] show promise in various applications, their capabilities, particularly when integrated with language models, are not universally well-connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A deep understanding of the underlying theory is required to discern where these connections exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Inability to Handle Novelty

A significant limitation of language models is their inability to perform novel planning sequences that are not almost exactly present in their training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

Conversely, language models excel at tasks that involve various mixes and matches of information already encountered in their training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples of tasks they are effective at include:
*   Answering or labeling emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Adding CSS to HTML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Iteratively debugging common Python problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

## Challenges in Research and Algorithm Creation

Language models struggle with tasks requiring genuine innovation or the creation of truly novel solutions. For instance, [[challenges_in_using_ai_for_research_advancements | AI agents]] attempting to independently achieve a research breakthrough are often ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

In research settings, where new algorithms—even simple ones consisting of only a few lines of code—are often created, language models have not been helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This is because these new algorithms are, by definition, not present in the models' training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

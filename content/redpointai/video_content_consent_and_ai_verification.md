Authenticity is a critical aspect for businesses serving enterprise customers, especially concerning content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The focus on authenticity involves two main areas: creating avatars and generating video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Consent Requirements
For every avatar created, a video consent format is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This ensures that an avatar cannot be created without the individual's consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. These practices contribute to [[data_privacy_and_ethical_considerations_in_generative_ai | data privacy and ethical considerations in generative AI]] and overall [[trust_and_data_security_in_ai | trust in AI systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## AI Verification and Human Moderation
The process incorporates a hybrid solution involving both AI models and human moderation teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Advanced AI Matching
Advanced AI is utilized to match the video consent footage with the person to confirm it is the same individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This makes it almost impossible to create someone's avatar without their consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Human Review Process
In addition to AI verification, a moderation team conducts human reviews of the footage to ensure everything is as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Platform Moderation Policy
The platform enforces a strict moderation policy that prohibits certain types of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Prohibited Content
> The platform policy explicitly forbids:
> *   Hate speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

> *   Political campaigns or related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

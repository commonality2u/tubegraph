HeyGen prioritizes security and trust when serving its [[trust_and_safety_mechanisms_at_heygen | enterprise customers]], who include some of the largest companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The company's approach to "security and trust" (likely referring to integrity and security) is twofold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Security and Trust for Enterprise Clients

HeyGen's commitment to security and trust is demonstrated through its robust measures concerning avatar creation and video content:

*   **Consent for Avatar Creation** For every avatar created on HeyGen, video consent is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This process employs [[ai_and_human_moderation_at_heygen | advanced AI]] to match the consent footage with the person, making it nearly impossible to create an avatar without the individual's permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Content Moderation** The platform uses a hybrid solution that combines [[ai_and_human_moderation_at_heygen | AI models]] and a human moderation team to review footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This ensures all content adheres to HeyGen's moderation policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The policy prohibits hate speech, misinformation targeting children, and political campaign content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. These [[trust_and_safety_mechanisms_at_heygen | measures]] are crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety required by enterprise-level clients.

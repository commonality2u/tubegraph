AI [[advancements_and_implications_of_ai_agents | agents]] demonstrate a strong connection with the capabilities of language models in specific areas, though not in the majority of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A deep theoretical understanding is required to discern where these connections are most effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Capabilities of AI Agents

AI [[advancements_and_implications_of_ai_agents | agents]] excel at tasks that involve various mixes and matches of information found in their training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Examples of tasks where [[advancements_and_implications_of_ai_agents | agents]] are highly effective include:
*   Answering or labeling emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Adding CSS to HTML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Iteratively debugging common Python problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

## Limitations of AI Agents

Despite their strengths, current AI [[advancements_and_implications_of_ai_agents | agents]] face significant [[the_limitations_and_potential_of_current_ai_models_towards_agi | limitations]]. Any [[advancements_and_implications_of_ai_agents | agent]] requiring novel planning sequences—sequences that are not almost exactly present in its training data—will be unable to perform the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

Specific examples of tasks that [[advancements_and_implications_of_ai_agents | agents]] struggle with include:
*   Independently creating a research breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   Assisting in the creation of novel algorithms, even if they are only four or five lines of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This is because, by definition, such novel algorithms are not present in the [[advancements_and_implications_of_ai_agents | agent]]'s training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Adopting AI solutions should follow an incremental approach, starting small and gradually scaling up, with each step justified by rigorous evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The focus must be on making progress on objectives that truly matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Incremental Approach to AI Adoption

A crucial aspect of this process involves [[evaluating_ai_through_rigorous_roi_testing | rigorous ROI]] analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It's essential to [[experimenting_and_testing_ai_use_cases | test it]] with benchmarks and accept that initial benchmarks may be inadequate, requiring continuous refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Experimentation and Initial Testing

The journey typically begins with minimal investment, perhaps spending as little as 20 cents on platforms like OpenAI or Llama, to conduct a "litmus test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This initial phase aims to determine if [[effectiveness_of_ai_agents | AI is going to be good at this]] particular task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. There is currently limited [[capabilities_and_limitations_of_ai | good predictability]] regarding AI's suitability for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

It is recommended to approach AI implementation as a literal data science experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. To [[experimenting_and_testing_ai_use_cases | run an experiment]], users should aim to maximize their chances of success by:
*   Utilizing the [[capabilities_and_limitations_of_ai | best possible model]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   Starting with simple prompting, or manually providing a few known helpful documents into the context, to observe initial outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Escalating AI Application Complexity

If initial experiments yield promising results, the next steps involve increasing complexity:
*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: If the model lacks "telepathy" regarding internal enterprise data, implementing RAG becomes necessary to integrate proprietary information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Fine-tuning**: If significant value is being derived, [[cost_efficiency_and_accessibility_in_ai_technologies | fine-tuning]] can be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This process bakes knowledge directly into the model, potentially incurring higher upfront costs but leading to [[effectiveness_of_ai_agents | better quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

When integrating AI models with [[enterprise_ai_model_management | enterprise data]], a strategic, iterative approach is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The journey should be justified by rigorous Return on Investment (ROI) to ensure progress on meaningful objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Initial Experimentation and Benchmarking

Begin with small-scale experiments, such as spending a minimal amount on platforms like OpenAI or Llama on Databricks, to litmus test if [[developing_and_utilizing_ai_models_in_the_tech_industry | AI]] is suitable for a particular task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. There is often low predictability regarding whether [[developing_and_utilizing_ai_models_in_the_tech_industry | AI]] will be effective for a given use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

It is advised to act as a data scientist: run experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This involves:
*   Starting with the best available [[developing_and_utilizing_ai_models_in_the_tech_industry | model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   Directly prompting the [[developing_and_utilizing_ai_models_in_the_tech_industry | model]] or manually providing helpful documents into the context to observe outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   Developing benchmarks, testing against them, and iteratively improving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Scaling Up with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

After initial experiments confirm value, the next step involves implementing more robust data integration methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This often means utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to explicitly bring [[enterprise_ai_model_management | enterprise data]] to the [[developing_and_utilizing_ai_models_in_the_tech_industry | model]], as the [[developing_and_utilizing_ai_models_in_the_tech_industry | model]] cannot inherently know about internal [[enterprise_ai_model_management | enterprise data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## [[finetuning_approaches_and_considerations_in_ai | Fine-tuning]] for Enhanced Quality

[[finetuning_approaches_and_considerations_in_ai | Fine-tuning]] an [[developing_and_utilizing_ai_models_in_the_tech_industry | AI model]] is a subsequent step, to be considered once initial value has been demonstrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. [[finetuning_approaches_and_considerations_in_ai | Fine-tuning]] allows for baking specific knowledge and patterns into the [[developing_and_utilizing_ai_models_in_the_tech_industry | model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. While it involves a greater upfront cost, [[finetuning_approaches_and_considerations_in_ai | fine-tuning]] can lead to significantly better quality outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

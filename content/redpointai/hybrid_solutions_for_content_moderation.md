Hybrid solutions, combining AI models and human review, are crucial for content moderation, especially for platforms serving large enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach ensures content adheres to strict guidelines and prevents misuse.

## AI and Human Review for Consent and Content Verification

A key aspect of content moderation involves verifying the consent for creating avatars and the content itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

*   **Avatar Creation Consent:** For every avatar created on the platform, a video consent format is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Advanced AI is used to match the consent footage with the person, making it "almost impossible" to create someone's avatar without their consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This process integrates with [[video_content_consent_and_ai_verification | AI verification]] to confirm identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Content Review:** Beyond AI verification, a dedicated moderation team conducts human reviews of footage to ensure all content meets expected standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This dual-layer approach helps in upholding content integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Platform Moderation Policies

The platform adheres to a strict [[platform_moderation_policy | platform moderation policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This policy explicitly prohibits:
*   Hate speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Misinformation for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Any political campaign or related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

These policies are enforced through a hybrid solution that leverages both AI models and human oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

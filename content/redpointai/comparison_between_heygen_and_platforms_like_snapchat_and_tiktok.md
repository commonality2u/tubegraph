Traditional vertical video platforms, such as Snapchat and TikTok, have historically focused on similar end markets and avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Their core idea has been to empower creators to easily produce video content using a mobile camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## HeyGen's Differentiated Approach

In contrast, a new platform like HeyGen operates on a different premise. Its key value is not centered around mobile camera usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. HeyGen aims to [[heygens_mission_to_make_the_camera_obsolete_in_content_creation | make the camera obsolete]] in content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Dilemma for Incumbent Mobile Platforms

For existing mobile platforms, a significant dilemma arises as AI-generated content becomes more prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. If, for instance, 10% of content is AI-generated today, questions emerge on how to rank and recommend this content compared to the remaining 90% that is camera-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

This challenge intensifies if the ratio of AI-generated content reaches 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Mixing both types of content on the same platform could lead to existing camera-based creators experiencing a significant reduction in views and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Opportunity for New AI-First Platforms

Should the proportion of AI-generated content reach such a critical stage, there will be a necessity to build new platforms specifically designed for AI-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This represents a significant new opportunity for platforms that prioritize and are built around AI content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

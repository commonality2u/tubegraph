Artificial intelligence has "completely changed" the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Products like Suno, with over 10 million users and a recent fundraise of $125 million, are at the "epicenter of this ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, showcasing the transformative [[potential_and_development_of_ai_in_music_and_other_industries | potential of AI in music]].

## Suno's Approach to Music Creation

Suno's CEO, Mikey Shulman, emphasizes a vision for the [[future_possibilities_and_visions_for_ai_and_music_collaboration | future of music]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> that focuses on the joy of music creation itself, rather than solely the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The company aims to make music creation accessible to everyone, helping adults rediscover the playful, uninhibited interaction with music often seen in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### User Experiences and Categorization
Suno identifies two main categories of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>:

1.  **Casual Users**: These users engage in "soundtracking their life," narrating everyday moments musically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This includes creating songs about mundane events like a Starbucks order error or unexpected deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Music serves as a way to tell stories and relive funny or memorable moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This aligns with [[user_experiences_and_categorization_in_ai_music_platforms | user experiences and categorization in AI music platforms]].
2.  **Power Users**: This group views Suno as a "creative outlet" and enjoys the process of making music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. They spend hours crafting songs to match a specific sound or story in their head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Suno aims to give these users "control over the music" without the steep learning curve of traditional production software like Ableton or Pro Tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This demonstrates how AI democratizes access to creation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Overcoming the "Blank Canvas Problem"
A significant challenge for AI creator tools is the "blank canvas problem," where users don't know where to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Suno is working on making the initial creation process more intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

Instead of a text box prompt, future interactions might involve:
*   Humming a melody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   Tapping a beat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   Generating music based on mood descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   Using everyday sounds or visuals to inspire the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

The goal is to shift from text-driven interactions, which are seen as a sign of how early the technology is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, to more expressive and intuitive methods of input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### The Social and Collaborative Aspect of Music
A core vision for Suno is making music creation a shared experience, moving beyond single-player creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Mikey Shulman emphasizes that making music with other people is one of the "most enjoyable moments" of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Future developments include:
*   **Multiplayer Creation**: Synchronous (jam sessions) and asynchronous (sending half a song to be finished) co-creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   **Musical Conversation**: Treating music as a conversation, where users can riff off each other's ideas fluidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   **Live Performance & Interaction**: Observing Twitch streamers using Suno to create live music and engage audiences through micro-payments highlights the [[future_possibilities_and_visions_for_ai_and_music_collaboration | potential for interactive digital concerts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. This suggests a future where fans and even athletes could have input in creating event music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

This focus on shared experiences and collaboration reflects [[future_possibilities_and_visions_for_ai_and_music_collaboration | future possibilities and visions for AI and music collaboration]].

## Business Model and Technical [[challenges_and_innovations_in_ai_music_tech_and_infrastructure | Challenges and Innovations]]

Suno's current business model offers a free tier with a paid subscription for power users, but the company is "actively not trying to innovate on the business model" yet, given how early the market is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. The CEO notes that current AI pricing models often "blindly adapt" SAS pricing, which isn't ideal for AI due to non-zero marginal costs associated with generating songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_ai_advancements_on_business_models | impact of AI advancements on business models]].

### Model Evaluation
Evaluating music AI models is challenging due to the subjective nature of music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.
*   **Objective Metrics**: Automatic metrics for audio quality exist but are "flawed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
*   **Subjective Metrics**: "Aesthetics matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. The ultimate test is "how much do our users love the music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a> and the level of control users have over the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
*   **User Feedback**: User engagement (e.g., song usage, choosing models, sharing) and explicit feedback from communities like Discord are crucial for identifying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

### Infrastructure and Speed
Suno has experienced "insane Spike of usage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. Key aspects of their infrastructure include:
*   **Speed**: Suno strives for fast song generation, recognizing that users expect instant results akin to Spotify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. Transformers are used to stream songs while they are still being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Tools**: Suno uses platforms like Modal for easy deployment of jobs onto GPU infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>, avoiding the need to innovate on everything themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. They also benefit from breakthroughs in image and text AI communities that solve problems applicable to audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
These efforts contribute to addressing [[challenges_and_innovations_in_ai_music_tech_and_infrastructure | challenges and innovations in AI music tech and infrastructure]].

### Future Capabilities
Current limitations of music models include:
*   **Iterative Control**: Lack of precise control for iterative refinements (e.g., "do that but change X") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
*   **Specific Parameters**: Models don't reliably listen to precise instructions for elements like music tempo (BPM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

Suno's North Star metrics are focused on user enjoyment: how many users make songs, daily retention, likelihood of exhausting free tiers, and song sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

## Broader AI and Audio Market

The recent advances in audio AI, such as GPT-4o, highlight that audio "should be a first-class citizen" in the AI world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>, given that it's how "the vast majority of human communication happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

Potential applications for voice AI extend beyond music:
*   [[impact_of_ai_on_customer_support | Customer service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.
*   Programming and software development, where typing isn't always the most efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>, relating to [[the_impact_of_ai_on_software_development_and_programming_jobs | the impact of AI on software development and programming jobs]].
*   Smart home technology, enabling more natural voice interaction with household systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>.

Regarding the general audio model space, Shulman believes it will take "longer than people realize" for audio to be treated as more than just an interface for LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. He doesn't foresee rapid consolidation into a single giant model, suggesting room for many specialized audio models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. This aligns with [[potential_and_development_of_ai_in_music_and_other_industries | potential and development of AI in music and other industries]] across various domains.

## Funding and Future of Music Models
Suno recently raised $125 million, which will be used for "scale everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>, including training larger music models, conducting research, acquiring specialized data, and hiring talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. The goal is to "more quickly pull forward the [[future_possibilities_and_visions_for_ai_and_music_collaboration | future of music]]" that Suno envisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

A "3.5-minute pop song that is indistinguishable from what a human would make in a recording studio" is seen as a benchmark, but potentially "artificially constrained" and "disappointing" if it's the only goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. The true ceiling is higher because music is about how it makes you feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.

### Market Dynamics
The music AI market is considered "really, really big" and "so Green Field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>, suggesting ample room for multiple companies and different niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. This includes tools for professional artists and background music generation, which are not Suno's primary focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

Regarding IP partnerships, the CEO draws an analogy to Napster and Spotify, expecting both those who work with the industry and those who work against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. Suno is "very excited to work with the industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>. Direct artist partnerships (e.g., generating new songs by a specific artist without consent) are viewed as "viral moments" but not a significant part of the [[future_possibilities_and_visions_for_ai_and_music_collaboration | future of music]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. This perspective aligns with [[personal_anecdotes_and_experiences_related_to_ai_music_creation | personal anecdotes and experiences related to AI music creation]]. The focus is on enabling users to create music about "things that are relevant to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Hot Take: Open source AI is "overhyped" because compute costs create high barriers, making it difficult for open-source initiatives to keep pace with financially incentivized private companies, especially in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. Music, however, is "underhyped" as a part of people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

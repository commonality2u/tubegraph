AI is transforming creative tooling across images, video, music, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This transformation presents [[the_competitive_landscape_in_ai_writing_tools | opportunities for startups]] in the creative tool space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Key Opportunities for Startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>

Scott Belsky, founder of Behance and Chief Product Officer and Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, identifies several areas of opportunity for startups in the creative and marketing space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

#### Differentiation at the Interface and Data Level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>
The real opportunity lies in differentiation at the interface and data levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. While models are becoming commoditized, and most startups use third-party models, the unique value comes from how these models are integrated and controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

#### Hyper-Personalized Digital Experiences at Scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>
The creative and marketing space is moving towards [[ai_transformation_in_creative_workflows | hyper-personalized digital experiences]] at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. This means websites, emails, and even videos will be tailored to individual users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. To achieve this, companies need:
*   **Customer Data Platforms (CDPs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
*   **Workflows** for marketers to deploy, measure, and optimize campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   A connected **creative stack** to make templates with guardrails and "brand check AI" to ensure content appropriateness and protect brand integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.
    *   This involves fine-tuned workflow, interface, and data capabilities rather than just models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

#### Enabling Small Businesses to Operate at Scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>
There is significant opportunity in areas that were previously cumbersome, especially for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. AI tools can enable small businesses to operate with the capabilities of much larger organizations, effectively giving them a marketing team of 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This area is less focused on by big companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

#### Transforming Traditional Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>
Another significant opportunity exists in tackling antiquated processes in spaces like law, government, and other industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.

#### Human-Centric Personalization Beyond Digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>
Beyond digital, there's a strong opportunity in bringing personalized experiences to physical spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. AI can help create a sense of being "known" in hospitality or retail, similar to having a personal driver or shopper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. This applies the concept of scaling experiences that were once only available to a select few, making them accessible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>.

### Considerations for Startups

*   **Model Commoditization**: The increase in capability of [[the_evolution_of_ai_startup_strategies | AI models]] is happening rapidly, displacing other daily, and many use cases fall below the frontier of what these models are capable of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This means a focus will increasingly be on cost, with open-source models being leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. Startups relying solely on a model's superiority might face challenges as models become commoditized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   **Professional Grade Quality**: For commercial-grade media creation, the bar for quality is very high; outputs "can't look weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. There's a significant gap between cool demos and pragmatic, commercially viable quality use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Storytelling and Human Connection**: For areas like music, [[integration_of_ai_in_artistic_and_creative_industries | AI-generated music]] can lower the floor for creation, but the human story behind the art often drives its value and resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. Startups in creative fields should consider how to incorporate or emphasize the human element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

Synchronous speech translation, or real-time voice translation, is considered the "next frontier" in translation by DeepL's CEO and founder, Jarek Kutylowski <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. While AI-based text translation has significantly changed the language service industry and content consumption, the same level of capability has not yet been achieved for real-time conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

## Current State and Development
Currently, discussions like podcasts still require participants to speak a common language, such as English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. Major players have released demos of this technology, and DeepL is conducting its own research to bring it to a usable product that can be integrated everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.

Perfecting synchronous speech translation will take a few years, as spoken language is significantly more complex than text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>. Unlike text, which is chunked into sentences, spoken language is stream-based and often unstructured or "careless," posing a greater challenge for AI models to interpret and translate accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>. Key challenges include latency and the inherent ambiguity of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

## Future Implications
The widespread availability of real-time, ubiquitous speech translation models is expected to fundamentally change how the world operates, particularly in the business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

### Impact on Business and Global Operations
Synchronous speech translation could eliminate geographical limitations in business operations, allowing co-founders or team members to be located in different countries and still communicate seamlessly in their native languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. For multinational companies, it would significantly improve internal communication and efficiency by allowing employees to access education, learning resources, and knowledge across different languages with much greater ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. AI is anticipated to bridge these communication gaps entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.

### Impact on Language Learning and Culture
While AI will bridge many communication gaps, the personal connection and cultural aspects associated with learning languages will continue to hold significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. The ability of AI to provide fluent conversations with models could democratize access to language learning, making it less expensive than traditional in-person teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. However, the enjoyment of learning a language through real-life social interactions, like dinner with a native speaker, may still be preferred over speaking to a phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.

It is predicted that the average person will likely learn fewer languages in the future due to advanced translation capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>. However, those who do learn languages will do so out of personal interest, akin to playing chess, as languages are core to human beings and offer an intellectual challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. The importance of local languages may even increase as common ones become easily accessible through translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.

## Adobe's AI Strategy and Product Development

Adobe's Chief Product Officer and Chief Strategy Officer, Scott Belsky, discussed the company's approach to [[adobes_integration_of_ai_in_content_creation | AI integration]] in creative tooling, covering images, video, music, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The conversation highlighted when companies should train their own models, [[ai_integration_and_product_development_strategies | startup opportunities]] in the creative tool space, the future of [[adobes_integration_of_ai_in_content_creation | Adobe AI]], and what still needs to be built for enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Adobe's Core AI Philosophy

Adobe focuses on interfaces, models, and the underlying data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

*   **Models:** The [[generative_ai_and_adobes_firefly_suite | Firefly family]] represents Adobe's homegrown set of [[generative_ai_and_adobes_firefly_suite | generative models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. These models are trained exclusively on licensed content, and Adobe has a compensation program for content contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This approach aims to provide indemnification for customers, ensuring compliance and addressing legal concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. For example, [[generative_ai_and_adobes_firefly_suite | Firefly]] prevents generation of copyrighted characters like Spider-Man, which is a feature not a bug, due to legal implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Interfaces:** Adobe integrates these models into products like Photoshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. They also make models available to third parties and large companies for complex, at-scale workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Data:** A key focus is on enabling custom models for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. For instance, Nickelodeon could train a version of [[generative_ai_and_adobes_firefly_suite | Firefly]] on SpongeBob SquarePants to generate content for character development and storylines without concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Partnerships:** Adobe partners for LLM capabilities, surfacing them through products like Acrobat and digital experience products for marketing analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

#### Deciding to Build Proprietary Models
Adobe's litmus test for building its own models is whether it can deliver a better end-to-end experience than anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. This includes fine-tune controls, custom model capabilities, and leveraging user data on tool usage to refine model output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. If an area is commoditized or another company will always invest more and have something better, Adobe partners with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Product Development and User Experience

Adobe is focused on how [[ai_in_creative_workflows | creative professionals]] can unlock new workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

*   **Project Neo and [[generative_ai_and_adobes_firefly_suite | Firefly]] Integration:** Adobe observed users combining Project Neo (a 3D illustration program) with [[generative_ai_and_adobes_firefly_suite | Adobe Firefly]] to achieve extreme precision in image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This unexpected workflow highlighted that future [[advancements_in_ai_for_creative_tools | AI advancements]] are less about the "next best model" and more about the controls applied on top of the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Expanding Exploration:** [[aidriven_tools_in_adobes_creative_cloud | AI-driven tools]] enable creative professionals to explore a far wider range of possibilities much more quickly, overcoming time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   **Generative Recolor:** In Illustrator, this feature allows users to apply hundreds or thousands of color palettes based on prompts to vector creations instantly, a task that previously took days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **User Education and Taste:** The availability of new "superpowers" through AI doesn't mean users know how to wield them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Just as photography evolved to emphasize lens choice, lighting, and photo selection, taste becomes a crucial skill that AI offloads rudimentary tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Adobe's goal is to enable users to flex their taste through prompt augmentation and onboarding experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Future UI:** The next generation of AI will involve models not only generating content but also providing custom UI on demand for fine-tuning, which disappears when the task is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This means the UI would adapt to the specific use case, rather than being static <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Professional Grade Quality:** The bar for professional-grade media creation is high, especially for video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Adobe focuses on pragmatic, high-value use cases, such as extending a video scene by a few seconds in Premier Pro to save re-shooting a whole scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

> "The devil's in the defaults." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>
> Making [[aidriven_tools_in_adobes_creative_cloud | AI-driven tools]] a default part of the product interface, like Generative Fill in Photoshop, significantly increases utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. This requires a different product playbook than simply hiding new features in a panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

### Business Model and Pricing

Adobe uses a generative credit system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. Customers receive a basic amount of credits with their existing plans, with options to upgrade for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. This allows Adobe to adjust credit costs for more intensive capabilities, while aiming to keep them as cheap as possible to ensure accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.

### Market Trends and Opportunities

*   **Hyper-Personalization:** The creative and marketing space is moving towards hyper-personalized digital experiences at scale, where websites and emails will be tailored to individual users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. This requires integrated workflows, customer data platforms, and creative stacks with brand check AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **Startup Opportunities:** Significant opportunities exist in enabling small businesses to operate with the efficiency of large ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This involves tackling cumbersome processes in areas like law or government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
*   **Future of Models:** Scott Belsky initially believed a few models would dominate, but now anticipates thousands of models, many niche, some commoditized, and others focused on specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. Adobe's tools should allow users to choose different models for different use cases, for example, using less commercially safe models for ideation like mood boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Impact on Creativity:** While content generation will become free and ubiquitous, humans will increasingly crave scarcity, meaning, and craft in digital experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. This will reboot the role of humans in content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Shared social experiences, like discussing entertainment, are unlikely to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   **AI in Music:** Many music startups overemphasize AI's role and overlook that a song's value often comes from its human story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. AI can lower the barrier to music creation, but enabling artists to tell human stories behind their creations is crucial for resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Proactive Suggestions:** The next tier of [[aidriven_tools_in_adobes_creative_cloud | AI tools]] will move beyond simply doing things for users to offering proactive suggestions, guiding users to explore new avenues or anticipating performance issues in different contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   **OpenAI and Frontier Models:** Adobe views frontier model players like [[openais_approach_to_product_development_and_platform_strategy | OpenAI]] and Pika/Sora as part of the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. As long as people need interfaces to tell stories, leverage data to customize, and use tools to achieve their vision, Adobe maintains its strong position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. Improving models are seen as platforms that enhance Adobe's products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

### Scott Belsky's Side Hustle

Scott Belsky publishes a monthly newsletter called "Implications," which serves as an accountability mechanism and a way to connect dots from his learnings and conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. He does not use AI for writing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

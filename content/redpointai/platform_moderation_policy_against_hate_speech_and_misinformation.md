Integrity and [[Trust and safety in AIgenerated content | safety]] are critical for HeyGen's business, especially when serving large enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The company's work on integrity focuses on two main areas: avatar creation and video content moderation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Hybrid Moderation Approach

HeyGen employs a hybrid solution combining [[AI and human moderation at HeyGen | AI models]] and human review to ensure content adheres to its policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Consent for Avatars

To create an avatar on HeyGen, users are always required to provide video consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This process includes an advanced [[AI and human moderation at HeyGen | AI system]] that matches the consent footage to ensure it's the same person, making it nearly impossible to create someone's avatar without their explicit consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Content Review

Content created on the platform undergoes a dual review process:
*   **[[AI and human moderation at HeyGen | AI-driven review]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   **Human moderation team review** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

This combined approach ensures that all footage aligns with expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Prohibited Content Categories

HeyGen's platform moderation policy strictly prohibits several categories of content, including:
*   Hate speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Misinformation for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Any political campaign or related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

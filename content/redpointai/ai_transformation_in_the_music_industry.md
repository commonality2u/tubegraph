[[AI transformation in creative workflows | AI]] is fundamentally changing the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Suo, with over 10 million users and a recent fundraise of $125 million, is at the forefront of this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Mikey Shelman, CEO of Suo, is deeply involved in shaping the future of AI and audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Impact and Vision
AI brings a new dimension to music, expanding its role as a form of communication and storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The future of music is envisioned as more interactive, collaborative, and accessible to everyone, not just expert musicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Democratizing Creativity
One of the core aims of [[AI transformation in creative workflows | AI creator tools]], including Suo, is to reawaken the imaginative play often lost in adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. These tools aim to democratize access to creative expression, moving away from complex production software with steep learning curves like Ableton or Protools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The focus is on a guided creative experience, akin to "paint by numbers," allowing humans, who are hardwired to enjoy such experiences, to reconnect with their inner artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## User Experiences and Product Development
Suo identifies two main categories of users:

### Casual Users
Often described as "soundtracking your life," these users musically narrate happy, sad, funny, and memorable moments. Examples include songs about trivial occurrences like Starbucks getting a name wrong or unexpected visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Music serves as a personal storytelling medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Power Users
These individuals use Suo as a significant creative outlet, finding enjoyment in the process of making music as much as the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. They spend hours crafting songs to match sounds and stories in their heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The platform confirms that many people possess great musical taste and ideas but previously lacked the means to actualize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Overcoming the "Blank Canvas" Problem
A common challenge for [[Music creation with AI and user experiences | AI product development]] is the initial "blank canvas" or "cold start" problem, where users are unsure how to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. While current AI tools are largely text-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, the future aims for more intuitive input methods beyond text prompts, such as:
*   Humming melodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
*   Tapping beats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>
*   Using images or describing mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>
*   Incorporating everyday sounds like clinking glasses to inspire tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>
The goal is to make music creation a first-class citizen in communication and multimedia, realizing that reasons to make a song already exist, similar to sending a text or taking a picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## Collaborative and Social Aspects
A significant future focus for Suo is "everything multiplayer" â€“ enabling people to make music together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This includes:
*   **Synchronous creation**: Jamming together in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Asynchronous collaboration**: Sending half-finished songs or musical ideas to be modified and passed back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   **Interactive performances**: Witnessing a Twitch streamer using Suo for a digital concert, where viewers can micro-pay to interact and influence the music, creating an interactive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This concept could extend to sports stadiums, with fans contributing to game-time music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## Business Model and Pricing Strategy
Suo currently offers a free tier for a set number of songs, with charges for power users who generate more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. However, the [[business_model_and_pricing_strategy_for_ai_music_platforms | business model and pricing strategy for AI music platforms]] is still evolving and not yet settled across the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. The current approach often mimics SaaS pricing, which may not be entirely suitable for AI products due to non-zero marginal costs associated with generating content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. The company is actively focusing on product innovation before fully optimizing its business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

## Model Evaluation and Development
Evaluating music models is complex because music lacks a "correct" answer, unlike text or reasoning tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. While objective metrics for audio quality exist, they are often flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Ultimately, quality is measured by user satisfaction and love for the music produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. This often relies on human evaluation and feedback from a large, engaged user base, particularly through community channels like Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

### [[Challenges in AI product development for music | Challenges in AI product development for music]]
Despite rapid progress, challenges remain:
*   **Iterative control**: Users often need to express specific changes (e.g., "do that but change X") which is currently difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
*   **Precise control over musical elements**: Models provide loose guidelines for elements like tempo (BPM), but more objective and precise control is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.
*   **Speed**: While already fast, the expectation set by platforms like Spotify means continuous efforts to reduce generation time and keep users engaged in the creative journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. Suo utilizes autoregressive Transformers, allowing songs to stream while still being made, contributing to its speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

## Infrastructure and Scalability
Suo has experienced massive user growth, with 10 million songs generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. To support this, they have focused on being deliberate about where to innovate versus buy infrastructure solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. They leverage external tools like Modal for deploying jobs onto GPU infrastructure, grateful not to have to build everything in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. The audio domain benefits from [[advancements_in_ai_for_media_production | advancements in AI for media production]] in image and text communities, as many problems are solved and open-sourced there before becoming critical for audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

## Broader Opportunities in AI Audio
The recent wave of AI innovation, particularly with multimodal models like GPT-4o, highlights that audio should be a first-class citizen in AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. Audio is the primary mode of human communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. While current models like GPT-4o and ElevenLabs offer impressive audio interfaces, they often still rely on a text-based reasoning layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Full integration of audio into the underlying models is still some time away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. This suggests that consolidation into one giant model for audio may be distant, with room for many specialized audio models and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

## Market Landscape and IP
The [[integration_of_ai_in_artistic_and_creative_industries | AI music market]] is expected to be very large and diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. It's a "green field" with ample opportunities for various types of businesses:
*   Tools for professional artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.
*   Background music for vast content libraries like YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
*   Experiences for the general consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.

Regarding intellectual property (IP) and partnerships, the industry is in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. Suo aims to work *with* the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>. They avoid direct artist impersonation or generating "new Charlie Puth songs" without explicit consent, believing that such viral moments, while attention-grabbing, are not a significant part of the long-term future of music creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. The focus is on enabling users to create music relevant to their own lives and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

Ensuring authenticity and safety is critical for HeyGen, especially when serving large enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The company's approach to authenticity involves two main areas: creating an avatar and generating video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Consent Mechanism

For every avatar created on HeyGen, a video consent format is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Advanced AI is used to match the consent video with the footage, making it almost impossible for users to create an avatar of someone without their explicit consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Moderation and Policy

HeyGen employs a hybrid solution that combines both AI and human review to ensure content adheres to platform policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Footage is reviewed by [[ai_and_human_moderation_at_heygen | an AI]] and a dedicated [[ai_and_human_moderation_at_heygen | moderation team]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

HeyGen's platform moderation policy strictly prohibits:
*   Hate speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Misinformation targeting children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Content related to political campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

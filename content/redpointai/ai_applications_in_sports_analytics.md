Harrison Chase, founder and CEO of LangChain, initially found his interest in the AI world through sports analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. However, he noted that the potential applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the sports world are "fewer than I would have wished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>, and he would have "loved for there to be like a really Clear Connection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Current and Potential Applications

### Querying Player Statistics
One application observed involves using natural language to query player statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This allows users to ask questions like "who leads the league in three-pointers" and receive an answer from a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This makes stats more accessible, which is interesting given their role in fantasy sports, gambling, and general interest in sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. However, Chase doesn't consider this "super unique or super revolutionary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

### Generating Commentary
A "really cool" potential application is generating commentary for sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This aligns with creative applications of LLMs like Midjourney or Character AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. The idea is to generate commentators for a game without physical presence or even to personalize commentary to the specific viewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. For example, commentary could reference a specific shot watched by the viewer previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

### Internal Operations
An NBA team has reportedly chatted with LangChain, primarily for internal operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. This involves allowing people to query internal data within the organization, rather than consumer-facing applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### AI-Native Spreadsheets
An example of an AI-native spreadsheet was highlighted, where filling in column headers and using a "click and drag" feature, similar to an Excel macro, would spin up a separate agent for each cell to populate the spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>. This process involves executing many different agents in parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:10:00">[44:10:00]</a>. This type of application could be useful for sports analytics, as it allows for many different tasks to run concurrently, with users inspecting results afterwards, differing from a constant chat interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11:00">[44:11:00]</a>.

### Inference Costs
Regarding AI-native spreadsheets and similar applications, if an agent is spun up for every cell or task, inference costs could "add up really quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:55:00">[44:55:00]</a>. However, the expectation is that costs and latency will decrease over time, with OpenAI demonstrating a good track record of cutting costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:00:00">[45:00:00]</a>. The advice for startups is to "try to build it with GPT-4" and focus on achieving product market fit before worrying about costs, as costs will go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:22:00">[45:22:00]</a>. This aligns with the motto "no GPUs before PMF" (Product Market Fit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:44:00">[45:44:00]</a>.

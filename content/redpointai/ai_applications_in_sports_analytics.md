Harrison Chase, founder and CEO of LangChain, initially became interested in the world of artificial intelligence through sports analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. While he wished for more clear connections between large language models (LLMs) and sports analytics, he noted a few interesting applications he's observed or envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Current and Potential Applications

### Natural Language to Query Sports Statistics
One application Harrison saw involved using LLMs to enable natural language queries for player statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This would allow users to ask questions like "who leads the league in three-pointers?" and receive an answer from a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The goal is to make sports statistics more accessible, which is relevant for fantasy sports, gambling, and general interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, he considers this application "not super unique or super revolutionary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### AI-Generated Sports Commentary
A more exciting potential application involves generating commentary for sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Harrison sees this as a creative application of [[ai_in_creative_workflows | AI in creative workflows]], similar to Midjourney or Character AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The next level of this concept would be to personalize the commentary to the specific viewer watching the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Internal Operations for Sports Teams
An NBA team has utilized LangChain for internal operations, primarily to query data within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This use case is not consumer-facing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This falls under [[enterprise_applications_for_ai_including_business_intelligence_and_data_extraction | Enterprise applications for AI]].

### Future Possibilities: AI-Native Spreadsheet for Stats
While not directly in sports, Harrison highlighted a "cool" user experience (UX) involving an AI-native spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. In this concept, users could fill in column headers, and then dragging like an Excel macro would spin up a separate [[ai_coding_and_software_engineering_advancements | AI agent]] for each cell to populate the spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. This could enable parallel execution of many tasks, such as populating statistics, where instantaneous response is not critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>. This concept could potentially be applied to sports analytics for deep data analysis, though it would require significant computational resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations for AI in Sports
While the potential for [[ai_applications_and_market_potential_across_various_industries | AI applications]] in sports is significant, several challenges and considerations arise:
*   **Cost and Latency:** Complex AI applications like the spreadsheet example, which spin up multiple agents, could be very expensive at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. However, Harrison advises startups not to focus on cost initially, as latency and costs are expected to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. The advice is to "use GPT-4 until [[ai_usecases_with_product_market_fit | product market fit]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.
*   **Multimodal Limitations:** Current multimodal models are not precise enough for many detailed knowledge work tasks, such as extraction from images, due to insufficient spatial awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.
*   **UX Innovation:** The most interesting work in AI applications currently lies in user experience (UX), as how people want to interact with these new technologies is still largely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.
*   **Personalization:** Harrison believes that personalization at the user level is a key missing element for AI apps to truly "take on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>. This applies to sports commentary tailored to individual preferences, and more broadly to [[ai_powered_tutoring_tools | AI-powered tutoring]] or relationship management tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. The idea of a "journal app that remembers things about you" is a related concept for personalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. Personalization can be achieved through various methods, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or fine-tuning models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>.
*   **Application Maturity:** The current stage of [[ai_product_market_fit_and_emerging_applications | AI product market fit]] is still early, with more focus on internal enterprise applications due to lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. Enterprise adoption of user-facing products is slower due to regulatory concerns and risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.

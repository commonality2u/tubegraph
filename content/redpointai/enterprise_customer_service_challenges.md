Authenticity and integrity are critical for businesses serving large enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A key aspect of this involves ensuring the ethical and appropriate use of AI, particularly when creating digital content like avatars and videos.

## Hent's Approach to Authenticity

The company Hent has a two-pronged approach to ensuring authenticity: one focuses on avatar creation, and the other on video content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Avatar Creation Consent

For every avatar created on the Haen platform, a video consent format is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Advanced AI is used to match the consent footage with the person, making it "almost impossible" to create someone's avatar without their consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Video Content Moderation

Hent employs a hybrid solution that combines AI models with human moderation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While AI helps detect issues, a human moderation team also reviews footage to ensure it meets expected standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Content Moderation Policy

The platform enforces a strict moderation policy that prohibits:
*   Hate speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Misinformation for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   Political campaigns and related information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education presents both challenges and opportunities, particularly concerning its responsible application. Grammarly, an AI-powered writing assistant, has been actively exploring how to foster effective and ethical use of [[AI in education|AI tools]] in academic settings. Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, CEO of Grammarly, discusses the company's approach to ensuring [[AI in education|AI]] becomes a tool for augmentation and skill development, rather than displacement or misuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.

## Current Landscape and Educator Perspectives

Initially, there was a tendency among some educators to ban AI, but this stance has largely dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. Today, many educators are eager to engage with AI and partner with industry to incorporate it into pedagogical methods responsibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. The focus has shifted to equipping graduates with critical AI-related skills necessary for success in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

The challenge lies in preventing misuse while leveraging the power of AI to enhance learning. This is comparable to past debates around calculators or looking up code snippets online, which were once considered cheating but are now accepted tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

## Grammarly's Approach to Responsible AI Use

Grammarly aims to provide tools that enable transparency and responsible engagement with AI. The company focuses on specific features designed to help students and educators navigate the ethical considerations of AI use:

### Citing AI Use
One significant feature allows users to cite their use of AI in a work product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. This feature differentiates between:
*   **Engaged Use:** A student who actively uses Grammarly for feedback, asking for improvements on specific paragraphs or conclusions, and incorporates those suggestions to deepen their understanding of the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.
*   **Passive Use:** A student who simply prompts the AI to write an entire essay without engagement or learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

Citations make it clear how much a student engaged with the content and the AI tool, allowing educators to distinguish between genuine learning and simple outsourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.

### Authorship Feature
Grammarly is launching an "authorship" feature that provides the provenance of every piece of a document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. This feature indicates:
*   Parts written manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
*   Parts cut and pasted and potentially paraphrased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>.
*   Parts that were [[AI in education|AI]] generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

This offers transparency, allowing educators to see what parts were acceptable to be auto-generated versus those that should have been original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

## The Future of AI in Education
Rahul Roy-Chaudhury envisions [[AI in education|AI]] as a tool for augmentation, providing "superpowers" to students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. In the future, students could use [[AI in education|AI]] to:
*   Engage deeper with material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.
*   Receive real-time feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.
*   Access educational resources, especially in underserved regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

AI acts as a "great leveler" and "democratizer of skills," opening up possibilities for learning and skill development that might otherwise be unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. Instead of comparing AI to an idyllic small class setting, it's crucial to acknowledge its potential to significantly improve [[AI in education|education]] access and quality globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.

This significantly helps maintain "creative flow" by eliminating the need to switch between the editor and a browser for internet searches and copy-pasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Natural Language as a Development Tool

The addition of chat functionality and the use of natural language are crucial, as humans think in their native languages, not in code or deterministic machine language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This democratizes software development, allowing individuals, including children, to express ideas and build games in languages like Brazilian Portuguese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### The Future Role of the Software Developer

Despite [[AI research and innovation|AI]]'s advancements, the role of a software developer in five years is expected to look "very similar to today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The change will be gradual, given the vast amount of existing code and the continuous creation of new codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

[[strategic_uses_of_ai_in_enterprises|AI]] will:
*   **Simplify Maintenance**: Make it easier to navigate complex, decades-old codebases, including those still running COBOL on mainframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Improve Onboarding**: New team members can quickly learn about codebases, stacks, and institutional knowledge by asking Copilot questions in natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Automate Tedious Tasks**: Copilot will handle "not so fun stuff" like managing backlogs, addressing enterprise adoption blockers, and ensuring fundamentals like availability, security, and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Features like Copilot Autofix will help burn down security vulnerabilities and accessibility issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This frees developers to focus on innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### AI Agents and Their Function

Copilot itself is considered an agent, akin to a co-pilot flying a plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Developers are already accustomed to autonomous processes like CI/CD. [[AI research and innovation|AI]] agents will automate tasks like fixing security issues, much like dishwashers automate cleaning, allowing developers to focus on implementing new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

### Impact Across Industries

While some industries like translation may see replacement of human roles due to [[AI research and innovation|AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, in software development, [[AI research and innovation|AI]] will primarily "up level" capabilities, allowing developers to move up the technological stack, similar to past shifts from VMs to containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. This includes advancements in accessibility, where [[AI research and innovation|AI]] devices might render the world perfectly for users with vision impairments, reducing the need for developers to manually implement accessibility features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

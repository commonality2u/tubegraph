Khan Academy, an influential educational platform serving over 150 million learners across 190 countries, has made significant strides in developing and deploying [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI powered tutoring tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Salman Khan, the founder and CEO of Khan Academy, highlights that schools may be among the first places to see mainstream adoption of [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI for productivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Khan Migo: An AI Assistant

Khan Academy's primary [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI powered tutoring assistant]] is called Khan Migo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. It has already been deployed to over 1.4 million students and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The core mission of Khan Academy is to provide free world-class education for anyone, anywhere, and Khan Migo aims to approximate the personalization a good human tutor would offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Khan Migo is designed to function as both a tutor and a teaching assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Key features and considerations include:

## Impact on Students

While highly motivated students can learn a lot from tools like Chat GPT through self-prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, Khan believes that for most students, the [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] is not yet ready to drive learning entirely on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Khan Migo acts as a support, engaging students and reinforcing traditional practice on Khan Academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Engagement and Accuracy
A primary challenge is engagement, as efficacy often follows engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Khan Migo aims to improve student engagement.

Regarding accuracy, Khan Migo, when anchored to Khan Academy content, boasts an error rate of about 2%, split between math errors and evaluation errors (e.g., incorrect feedback on partially correct answers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This is considered better than many human tutors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### Surprising Student Uses
Students have found unexpected ways to use the [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]]:
*   **Literary Character Simulations** Students engage in lengthy conversations with [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] simulations of literary characters (e.g., Jay Gatsby) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. These simulations are designed to drive conversation, asking students about their thoughts and personal connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Concept Exploration** Students, even in advanced math, use the [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] to explore ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. They recognize the [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] isn't always right, similar to human tutors, but it's a valuable tool for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

*   **Student Insights** Teachers can use the [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] to get insights into where students are at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Writing Coach** Khan Academy developed "Writing Coach," an [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] tool that helps students with writing assignments. It acts as an ethical coach, provides brainstorming and outlining tools, and shows the teacher the student's entire process, not just the final output. This helps combat cheating, including from other [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

Teachers have been observed using [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] simulations of historical figures (e.g., Harriet Tubman, George Washington) to engage students in class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. School districts are reporting that [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] saves teachers at least 5 hours per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a> and are using it as a recruiting and retention tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

## [[future_of_ai_in_education | Future of AI in Education]]

The [[future of ai in education | future of education]] will see classrooms resembling current "great classrooms" where students are actively engaged, problem-solving, and interacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Proactive AI and Immersive Learning
The next phase of Khan Migo involves making the [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] much more [[proactive_ai_interventions | proactive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Instead of just waiting for questions, the [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] will greet students, remind them of tasks, and offer assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This addresses the "blank screen problem" where users don't know what to prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

Khan Academy plans to pilot "Khan Academy Classroom," featuring a [[proactive_ai_interventions | proactive AI]] that not only engages students directly but also informs teachers when a student needs help (e.g., with the distributive property), allowing the teacher to assign an [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] tutoring session as an assignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. This teacher-in-the-loop approach is considered essential for engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.

Looking further ahead, within 20 years, a significant aspect of learning will involve virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) becoming mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Combined with generative [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]], students will be able to immersively engage in simulations, virtual worlds, and historical periods, akin to a "magic school bus ride" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Broader Adoption
Khan believes that schools will be among the first places to adopt [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] mainstream for productivity and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. The cost-effectiveness of [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI]] tutoring ($10-$15 a year) is dramatically cheaper than traditional live tutoring ($25-$50 an hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, making it highly attractive for districts seeking to improve learning outcomes.

The software development landscape is increasingly influenced by AI, bringing both challenges and opportunities, particularly concerning legacy code systems like COBOL. Many companies, including major banks, still run decades-old COBOL code on mainframes, originally developed by engineers who are now retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. These critical systems, lacking modern development practices like agile or unit testing, require continuous maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## The Enduring Presence of Legacy Code
Despite advancements, codebases dating back decades, such as COBOL on mainframes, are still actively managed by many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. These older systems were developed before modern methodologies like agile software development, test-driven development, or Scrum were prevalent, meaning they often lack comprehensive unit tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This presents a significant challenge for maintenance and understanding for current developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Legacy code, including COBOL, powers vital infrastructure in various sectors, such as the U.S. government, financial systems, and hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>. With many original COBOL developers having retired, there's a shrinking pool of human expertise to manage these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

## AI as a Catalyst for Change and Efficiency
AI is poised to make the management of complex, legacy systems significantly easier and more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Lowering Barriers to Understanding
One of the most significant [[enterprise_ai_adoption_challenges | challenges]] for developers joining a new company or project is learning the existing codebase, stack, and institutional knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. AI can simplify this process by allowing developers to ask questions about the codebase, deployment procedures, or library additions in natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This capability can also be used to explain existing code, helping developers quickly grasp what a section of code does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Automation of Toil
AI can automate the less enjoyable aspects of development, allowing engineers to focus on innovation and creative tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This includes:
*   **Security Vulnerability Remediation**: AI agents, like GitHub Copilot's autofix, can help resolve security vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a> and accessibility issues, burning down backlogs and helping systems stay "clean" by preventing the reintroduction of vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
*   **Code Review and Standards**: AI can assist in reviewing code for adherence to coding standards, refactoring, and multi-file edits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.
*   **Issue Management**: AI agents within issue forms can help users provide more specific and detailed bug reports or feature requests, ensuring better communication and clarity within development teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The concept of "agents" in AI is akin to Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, where a task is given, and a result is returned autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Fine-Tuning and Customization
One of the most requested features by Enterprise customers is the ability to fine-tune AI models for their specific, often old, codebases and internal libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. This allows companies to create a tailored AI assistant that understands their unique coding patterns and ensures adherence to internal standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

## Implications for the Future
The role of the software developer will evolve, moving up the stack as AI handles more fundamental tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. While AI acts as a layer on top of code, the underlying deterministic machine code doesn't disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Developers will still need to understand the code base for debugging or deep dives into complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

> "I think actually it will look very similar to today. We should not overestimate how how fast the change will will go given how much software, how many lines of code exists, right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>

The acceleration of AI development, driven by AI systems building other AI systems, suggests a rapid pace of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. This will lead to continued [[challenges_and_advancements_in_ai_technology | innovation]] across the entire development stack, from chips to applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. The focus shifts from manual tasks to higher-level problem-solving and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>.

The challenge of maintaining legacy COBOL systems, with dwindling expert knowledge, presents a prime opportunity for AI to learn COBOL and either maintain these systems or facilitate their realistic re-implementation into modern technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:15">[01:02:15]</a>. Startups are already working on converting COBOL to modern code using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

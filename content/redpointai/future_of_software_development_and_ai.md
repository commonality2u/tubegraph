GitHub, the world's largest source code host, is at the center of the developer ecosystem and has been a pioneer in AI integration with GitHub Copilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. GitHub Copilot was the first [[future_of_coding_and_ai_integration | AI coding assistant]] and is currently used by over 1.3 million developers and more than 50,000 enterprise subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Thomas Dohmke, CEO of GitHub, shares his perspective on the [[future_of_coding_and_ai_integration | future of AI in coding]] and lessons learned from scaling Copilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Impact of GitHub Copilot

The most exciting aspect of being CEO of GitHub in the age of AI is Copilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Seeing developers use it, witnessing their positive feedback, and observing its "magical" impact has been incredibly rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Early metrics, which initially seemed unbelievable, confirmed Copilot's significant code generation capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The widespread adoption of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked a turning point, shifting customer conversations from skepticism to an eagerness to adopt AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This consumerization of AI has led to a broader understanding and demand for AI tools within companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Lowering Barriers to Software Development

AI helps lower the barrier to software development for people around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The initial Copilot, without chat or agents, focused on auto-completion, enabling developers to stay in their creative flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. By providing ten lines of code, rendering entire test cases, or showing how to connect to the cloud, Copilot prevents developers from switching between their editor and browser for searches, which often breaks concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This focus on "keeping engineers in the flow" was the initial impetus behind generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

Natural language plays a crucial role in making coding more accessible, as people think in natural language, not in code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The ability to ask questions about code or have it explained in natural language is powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This democratization extends to non-English speaking countries, allowing children, for example, to learn coding and build games in their native languages like Brazilian Portuguese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## The Evolving Role of the Software Developer

In the next five years, the [[impact_of_ai_on_software_engineering | role of the software developer]] will look very similar to today, as the existing volume of code and the slow pace of change in large, old codebases (like COBOL on mainframes) means rapid, complete replacement is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Instead, AI will simplify the maintenance of complex systems and make institutional knowledge more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Developers will be able to ask Copilot in natural language about deployment procedures, adding libraries, and understanding codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

AI will handle less enjoyable tasks, allowing developers to focus on innovation and creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. For example, AI agents like Copilot Autofix will help resolve security vulnerabilities and accessibility issues, freeing developers to work on new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## The Rise of [[future_of_ai_agents_in_software_development | AI Agents]]

Copilot itself can be considered an agent, akin to a co-pilot who sometimes flies the plane autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Developers are already accustomed to agents in the form of CI/CD pipelines, which automate tasks like running tests and creating log files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

AI agents are like household appliances such as dishwashers or robotic vacuums; they perform tasks, freeing up human time without being feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Future security tools will not just identify issues but actively help resolve them, enabling developers to move on to the next feature more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

While some industries, like translation, may see significant human replacement by AI, software development will likely see an "up-leveling" of work, moving further up the stack, similar to past shifts from VMs to containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## Impact on Learning and Open Source

### The Learning Journey for New Developers

AI adds a higher abstraction layer, with human language on top of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. While AI can generate initial code, developers still need to understand the underlying code for debugging and modification, similar to how developers use open-source libraries without necessarily diving into their internal code unless problems arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

AI, particularly Copilot, makes it easier for new developers to get started and "unblock" themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Unlike learning to code in the 90s with only books and magazines, today's developers can use AI to explore problems, fix bugs, and iterate with context-aware chat interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### The [[the_future_of_ai_models_and_open_source_development | Impact of AI on the Open-Source Ecosystem]]

AI-powered coding is expected to make open source even more dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. AI tools will naturally suggest the use of open-source projects, as they are trained on vast amounts of internet data that include these projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. This increases the usage of open source and improves the lives of maintainers by assisting with tasks like summarizing discussions or handling security issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

AI will also likely increase the number of contributors to open-source projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. It lowers the barrier to contribution by helping users understand codebases and adhere to project standards, reducing the fear of pull request rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

There's a potential for AI models to favor higher-quality or more frequently used open-source projects, which could lead to consolidation around key projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This might reduce duplication and waste, leading to truly net-new creations instead of redundant efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. AI models often leverage the existing context of a project (e.g., frameworks already in use) to suggest relevant code, further promoting established libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

### Customization and Extensibility

Fine-tuning for Copilot is a highly requested feature, particularly from enterprise customers who have older codebases and specific internal libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. This feature allows users to select GitHub repositories to create a fine-tuned model, providing a tailored Copilot experience without needing data science expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.

The evolution of Copilot has been challenging due to its rapid development, but it has exceeded expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. While AI-generated code may "hallucinate" or be imperfect, developers are already accustomed to modifying code snippets found online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. Copilot's strength lies in its ability to provide a closer-to-perfect answer by understanding variable names and context within the editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. The goal is to raise the average quality of generated code, which improves as models and systems get better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

Extensions are a "super important part" of Copilot's future, as projects rarely rely solely on a programming language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>. They allow integrating custom platform engineering stacks and other services (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Stripe, Azure) directly into Copilot Chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. This extensibility, combined with better models and fine-tuning, is crucial because even the best models won't know a company's specific stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.

### Acceleration and Future Milestones

The pace of AI development is not only sustainable but accelerating because AI is now being used to build AI systems, allowing for faster development cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. AI agents will help clear security and accessibility backlogs, and eventually, devices may handle accessibility, or agents will prevent reintroducing vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. This means developers can spend more time on innovation and less on mundane tasks like security dashboards or compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

Innovation will occur across the entire stack, including new chip companies designing GPUs for faster Transformer models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. This will lead to better models, improved responsible AI, and countless new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. No part of the development stack is expected to be untouched by AI's efficiency gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_development | Challenges and Opportunities in AI Development]]

The AI market is not a "winner-takes-all" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. Companies, including Microsoft and GitHub, must constantly reinvent themselves to remain relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. Competition is beneficial, fostering continuous innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

Enterprises will likely use multiple AI models for code-related work, given that tools like Copilot already use various models for different functions (e.g., auto-completion, chat, responsible AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Just as companies use multiple SaaS services, they will adopt various AI tools and models tailored for specific use cases, such as testing, security, data collection, or specialized vision models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

### Advice for Founders

For founders competing with incumbents in the AI era, the key advice is to "play the long game" and focus on the big picture rather than short-term battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. Companies must continuously reconfigure and adapt to technological changes, always seeking new product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>. A critical leadership skill, especially as a company grows, is the ability to say "no" to most ideas to maintain focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

GitHub encourages developers to build extensions across the entire software development stack, inviting them into their partner program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. Specific areas of interest for extensions include accessibility, security, and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>. The future power of Copilot lies in the mix of extensions and agents, moving beyond code completion to tasks like scanning and fixing vulnerabilities, reviewing code, and understanding entire codebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>. AI agents can also assist with issue filing by making bug reports and feature requests more specific and detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>.

> "AI is a layer on top of code, but code doesn't go away. The machine at the end of the day, you know, has a processor CPU and a GPU in it that both run a deterministic instruction set... AI adds the human language as as a higher abstraction layer." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>

## Reflections on the [[ai_and_the_future_of_work | Future of AI]]

AI's [[the_future_of_ai_models_and_open_source_development | impact on biotech]] and [[the_future_of_ai_in_robotics and its impact | climate change]] are currently "underhyped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>. Thomas Dohmke is not scared by generative AI, even as a parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>. He believes AI will even help protect against deepfakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>.

While the number of developers needed within a specific company might decrease due to automation of rote tasks (similar to the decline of QA roles), the overall number of companies and micro-businesses creating software is expected to increase significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>. The barrier to building software and creating apps will drop dramatically, unleashing human creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>. This may also lead to more non-traditional individuals engaging in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.

A unique challenge and opportunity for AI lies in maintaining and potentially modernizing legacy COBOL codebases, which power critical systems in governments, financial infrastructure, and hospitals, especially as most COBOL developers have retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. Startups are already addressing this specific use case of converting COBOL to more modern code using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>.

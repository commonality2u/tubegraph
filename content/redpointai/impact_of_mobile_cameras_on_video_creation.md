Mobile cameras have played a foundational role in the evolution of video content creation on social platforms. Companies like Snapchat and TikTok have concentrated on similar markets and avatars, primarily focusing on enabling creators to easily produce vertical video content using their mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The core idea for these platforms has been to unlock creators through the accessibility of the mobile camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### The Shift from Camera-Based to AI-Generated Content

A new generation of platforms, however, aims to shift away from camera-based creation. For these new platforms, the key value proposition is to make the camera obsolete, focusing instead on [[heygens_mission_to_make_the_camera_obsolete | AI video creation tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This introduces a dilemma for existing mobile platforms that have historically relied on camera-based content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

There is a significant challenge in how platforms will rank and recommend [[aigenerated_content_versus_camerabased_content | AI-generated content versus camera-based content]] if, for example, 10% of content is currently AI-generated compared to 90% that is camera-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The situation becomes even more complex if the ratio shifts to 50% [[aigenerated_content_versus_camerabased_content | AI-generated content]] and 50% camera-based content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Impact on Traditional Creators and Future Platforms

If [[aigenerated_content_versus_camerabased_content | AI-generated content]] and camera-based content are mixed, existing content creators who rely on cameras could experience a significant decrease in views and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Should this scenario materialize, it may necessitate the creation of new platforms specifically designed for [[aigenerated_content_versus_camerabased_content | AI-generated content]], presenting a fresh opportunity for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

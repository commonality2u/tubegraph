The advent of AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, has dramatically reshaped the landscape for businesses, pushing companies to rethink their strategies and product development. Intercom, a customer support platform, exemplifies this rapid adaptation, swiftly rolling out AI-powered products like Fin within months of ChatGPT's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This shift highlights a critical turning point for how AI will integrate into and transform core business functions.

## Rapid AI Adoption: Intercom's Case Study

Intercom's journey into aggressive AI adoption began immediately after ChatGPT's launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The company's AI/ML team in Dublin, Ireland, quickly recognized the profound implications of conversational AI, which excels at fact-finding, understanding, and summarizing information – core tasks of [[impact_of_ai_on_customer_support | customer support]] representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This led to a strategic decision to "rip up the entire AI/ML road map" and go "all in" on this new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

The timeline of Intercom's initial AI product rollout was notably swift:
*   **Before Christmas (2022):** Shipped initial AI features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **January (2023):** Had a "reasonable release" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **March (2023):** Launched Fin, their user-facing chatbot, initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **July (2023):** Broadly launched Fin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

This rapid pace was driven by the understanding that if Intercom didn't lead in integrating AI for [[impact_of_ai_on_customer_support | customer support]], another company would, potentially rendering traditional support models obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Incorporating AI into Intercom Products

Intercom's approach to integrating AI followed a "crawl, walk, run" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>:

1.  **"Zero Downside" AI Features (Inbox AI):** The first step involved building AI features into their inbox, such as summarizing conversations, translating messages, and expanding/collapsing text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. These features, initially powered by GPT 3.5 Turbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, provided real value for [[impact_of_ai_on_customer_support | customer support]] tasks like ticket creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The key was to offer optional features where users could choose whether to engage, minimizing risk if the AI wasn't perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

2.  **User-Facing Chatbot (Fin):** The next significant release was Fin, a user-facing chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This became possible with access to GPT-4 beta, which offered better control over "hallucinations" – instances where the AI generates incorrect or irrelevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Key concerns addressed included ensuring the bot was trustworthy, reliable, and stayed on topic, avoiding controversial or competitor-endorsing opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Fin answers questions based on a high-confidence threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

3.  **Enhanced Inbox AI and Future Developments:** Inbox AI was later expanded with features like adjusting response tone to match a company's brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Future plans include further integration of Fin within the inbox and the ability for Fin to answer support emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

### [[Challenges and Strategies in Enterprise AI Deployment | Challenges and Strategies in Enterprise AI Deployment]]

Deploying AI at scale in enterprises involves several key challenges:

*   **Guardrails and Hallucination Prevention:** The core strategy involves rigorous "torture tests" to identify misbehaviors and ensure desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This includes prompting the model to prioritize specific contexts and resolve conflicts in information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. There's a trade-off: more constrained models may be less creative and occasionally miss correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Intercom tests various models (GPT 3.5, GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, Llama) against scenarios, evaluating them on trust, cost, reliability, stability, uptime, malleability, and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Cost Optimization vs. Exploration:** While initial ideas like automatically summarizing all 500 million monthly conversations would be prohibitively expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, Intercom remains primarily in "deep exploration mode" rather than cost optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The focus is on building the best possible product, assuming that technology will generally become cheaper and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Cost optimization will become a priority when models plateau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Latency:** Speed is a significant challenge, as AI responses can feel slow, akin to "modem internet days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. On-device LLMs (e.g., Apple, Google's Gemini) are expected to usher in "instant AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Missing Tooling:** While many companies are building their own solutions, there's a recognized need for better tooling, particularly in prompt management (versioning, AB testing, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Robust infrastructure for AI deployment (e.g., server location for EU compliance) is also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty in AI/ML Projects:** Unlike traditional software development where uncertainty often lies in the design phase, AI/ML projects introduce a second wave of uncertainty: whether a feature is even technically possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. This requires viewing AI initiatives as a "portfolio of bets" with varying probabilities of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

### Organizational Structure for AI

Intercom has a centralized AI/ML team of 17-20 people with deep domain expertise in building, running, and training models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This central team enables approximately 150 "regular product engineers" who then build user-facing features on top of the AI team's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

This centralized approach is recommended for companies that are either:
*   **AI-first startups:** Working on the bleeding edge of AI and pushing new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
*   **Companies whose existence depends entirely on AI:** Building new product categories enabled by LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

For companies merely "applying AI" as a minor enhancement, product engineers with some Open AI familiarity might suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

## [[Role of AI in Transforming Job Functions | Role of AI in Transforming Job Functions]] and Workflows

AI is poised to transform existing job functions and workflows in business operations:

*   **Pilot Mode to Broad Rollouts:** Many companies begin AI adoption in "pilot mode," perhaps using it for weekend support or with free users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. As value becomes apparent, companies shift from "AI curious to all in on AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. The ultimate goal is to make adoption a "dip your toe" experience rather than a "trustfall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.
*   **Automation Levels:** The percentage of requests handled by AI will vary by industry and product complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.
    *   **High Automation (e.g., E-commerce):** Simple product types with limited, common queries (e.g., "where is my order," "refunds") could see nearly 100% AI automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>.
    *   **Lower Automation (e.g., Complex Software):** Products like Google Docs, with thousands of diverse questions, may reach 80-90% automation, but not 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.
*   **Beyond Textual Answers (AI Actions):** [[Future applications of AI in workplace automation | Future applications of AI in workplace automation]] extends beyond text answers to AI performing actions (e.g., logging into Stripe to issue a refund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. This requires significant software development for authentication, monitoring, and data logging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Some businesses may opt for a "human-in-the-loop" model where AI proposes actions, but a human manager approves or modifies them, similar to a self-service checkout needing ID verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. This allows for human judgment on complex cases or customer history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.

## [[AI and the Future of Work | AI and the Future of Work]]: Shifting Product Landscapes

AI is fundamentally changing the product landscape, creating both threats and opportunities.

### For Startups

Startups should target areas where the incumbent technology stack is "irrelevant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This means finding industries where:
*   An incumbent, if starting today, would build their product "entirely differently" with AI at its core, making existing UI and features obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.
*   The fundamental value proposition is so transformed by AI that incumbent advantages (e.g., email sending infrastructure) become secondary to the AI-driven core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.

An example of a potentially disrupted product is an advertising optimization startup where AI could autonomously generate, deploy, measure, and optimize ads, leaving minimal human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.

### For Incumbents

Larger companies need a systematic approach to AI integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>:
1.  **Find Asymmetric Upside:** Start with simple, low-risk AI features to build expertise (e.g., automatically generating project titles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.
2.  **Workflow Analysis:** Break down the entire product into individual workflows (e.g., creating a project, assigning tasks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.
3.  **Automate and Delete:** If AI can reliably perform a workflow above customer accuracy thresholds, AI *must* do it, and the old manual components should be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. This is what startups will do.
4.  **Augment and Reduce:** If AI cannot fully remove a workflow, it should augment it or reduce it to a simple decision set, massively increasing efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.
5.  **Sprinkle AI:** Lastly, add "salt and pepper" AI features for a complete offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.
6.  **Educate Customers:** Learn how to effectively sell and explain the value of these AI transformations to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.

## Overhyped and Underhyped Aspects of AI

*   **Overhyped:** Productivity tools focused on generating content like emails or sales pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. The belief is that people will learn to detect AI-generated content, and filters will become more sophisticated, rendering this approach less effective long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.
*   **Underhyped:** The transformative changes coming to creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>. Just as Instagram's filters empowered everyone to feel like photographers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>, tools like Midjourney, Refusion (for sound), and Synthesia (for video) are enabling new forms of creativity that are yet to be fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.

## Industry Adoption and Future Outlook

Some incumbents have impressed with their AI adoption:
*   [[The future of AI in Adobes products | Adobe]] was quick to integrate AI, which was crucial for their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.
*   Figma and Miro have successfully found useful and valuable AI use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.

Conversely, Apple and Amazon have been surprisingly slow to fully adopt AI, especially considering their existing voice assistants like Siri and Alexa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. The hope for 2024 is a "leveling out" where widely adopted consumer products normalize advanced AI interactions, similar to how the iPhone normalized modern software design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. This will make AI adoption a competitive battleground, with consumers expecting AI-enriched software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.

The strategic decision to go "all in" on AI, as demonstrated by Intercom, is seen as crucial for gaining a first-mover advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. This contrasts with companies that only hire one person to "think about" AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a>. The shift from exploration to cost optimization in AI models is still ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>, but the increasing power and decreasing cost of models are enabling previously impossible features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. As AI continues to evolve, understanding its capabilities and applying it iteratively to core business functions will be key for companies to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

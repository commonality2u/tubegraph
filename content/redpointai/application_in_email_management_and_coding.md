Language models demonstrate strong capabilities in specific applications, particularly where tasks involve recombining existing data or common patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Strengths of Language Model Agents

### Email Management
Agents powered by language models are highly effective for tasks related to [[role_and_impact_of_ai_in_email_management | email management]], such as answering emails or labeling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Coding Assistance
In the realm of [[ai_coding_and_software_engineering_advancements | AI coding and software engineering advancements]], these agents excel at assisting with routine coding tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Examples include adding CSS to HTML or iteratively debugging common Python problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Limitations of Language Model Agents

### Novel Planning and Research Breakthroughs
Language model agents are not well-suited for tasks that require novel planning sequences not present in their training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. They struggle with attempts to independently create research breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. A deep understanding of underlying theory is necessary to identify where language models are genuinely effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Creating Novel Algorithms
When it comes to creating new algorithms, even those consisting of only a few lines of code, language models have not proven helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This limitation stems from the fact that these novel algorithms are, by definition, not present in the models' training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

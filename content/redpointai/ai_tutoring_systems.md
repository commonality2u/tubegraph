[[AI in education | AI]] is rapidly transforming education for students, teachers, and school systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Schools might be among the first places to see mainstream adoption of [[AI in education | AI]] for productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Khanmigo: An AI-Powered Tutoring Assistant

Salman Khan, the founder and CEO of Khan Academy, one of the most influential education platforms globally, has been at the forefront of implementing [[AI in education | AI]] in education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Khan Academy serves over 150 million learners across 190 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Their main [[AI in education | AI]] initiative is **Khanmigo**, an [[personalized_learning_through_ai | AI]]-powered tutoring assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Khanmigo has already been deployed to over 1.4 million students and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The core mission of Khan Academy has always been to approximate or replicate the personalization provided by a good tutor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[00:05:10]</a>. This vision draws inspiration from concepts like "The Young Lady's Illustrated Primer" from Neal Stephenson's *Diamond Age* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[00:05:58]</a>. The latest generation of models, particularly GPT-4, which Khan Academy accessed months before ChatGPT's public release, showed the potential to approximate tutoring and teaching assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Khanmigo's Features and Development

Khanmigo was launched as an [[AI in education | AI]] tutor and teaching assistant with key features:
*   **Guardrails**: Ensures teachers can monitor student activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Anti-cheating**: Designed to prevent cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Safety and Privacy**: Prioritizes student data protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Socratic Method**: Leans into good pedagogy by using a Socratic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[00:06:44]</a>.

Initial projections estimated 100,000 pilot users by 2025, but Khanmigo quickly surpassed this, reaching 1.3 to 1.4 million users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[00:06:55]</a>. Districts pay approximately $15 per student per year for the service, covering compute costs, support, and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Evolution to Proactive AI

Khan Academy is transitioning Khanmigo to be more **proactive** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[00:07:33]</a>. Currently, like a human tutor waiting in the back of the room, only about 10-15% of students proactively engage with the [[AI in language learning | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[00:07:44]</a>. The next version, "Khan Academy Classroom," aims for a more concierge-like [[AI in education | AI]] that actively welcomes students, reminds them of tasks, and offers assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[00:07:57]</a>.

The "blank screen problem" (users not knowing what to prompt) is addressed by suggesting actions and making the [[AI in language learning | AI]] more proactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Addressing AI Limitations and Efficacy

While many are developing [[AI in education | AI]] tutors, the [[AI in education | AI]] is not yet ready to drive learning entirely on its own for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[00:09:12]</a>. While curious individuals can learn a lot from tools like ChatGPT by spending significant time prompting it, this is not typical for most students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[00:09:21]</a>.

Current [[AI in education | AIs]] are still not perfect at creating high-quality questions without errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[00:09:35]</a>. Efficacy observed in deployments like Newark comes from combining traditional Khan Academy practice with [[AI in education | AI]] as a support tool to drive engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[00:09:48]</a>. The main challenge is engagement; if students engage with a reasonably healthy tool, it's likely to be efficacious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[00:10:09]</a>. [[AI in education | AI]] can help human systems facilitate engagement and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Unexpected Uses and Accuracy

Students have found surprising ways to use Khanmigo. For example, a student had a lengthy conversation with an [[AI in education | AI]] simulation of Jay Gatsby, which drove the conversation by asking about her own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[00:11:52]</a>. Students are also using it to explore advanced math concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[00:12:28]</a>.

Khanmigo's error rate when anchored to Khan Academy content is about 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[00:12:57]</a>. This 2% is split evenly between math errors (1%) and evaluation errors (1%), where the [[AI in education | AI]] might incorrectly assess a student's close answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[00:13:07]</a>. While aiming for 0% error, this rate is already considered better than many human tutors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[00:13:26]</a>.

### Teacher Adoption and Impact

Teachers are leveraging [[AI in education | AI]] to streamline lesson planning and delivery:
*   **Lesson Planning**: [[AI in education | AI]] helps create more entertaining and appropriately sized lesson plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **In-class Gaming**: A partnership with Blooket allows Khanmigo to generate game questions, reducing a teacher's prep time from half an hour to two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Insights**: Teachers gain insights from student performance to inform future planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **AI Simulations**: Teachers use [[AI in education | AI]] to open classes with engaging simulations of historical or literary figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Writing Coach**: Khan Academy's "Writing Coach" tool addresses cheating fears by having the [[AI in education | AI]] act as an ethical coach for assignments. Teachers receive the entire writing process, not just the final output, and the [[AI in education | AI]] flags copied content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[00:15:39]</a>. This undermines all forms of cheating, not just [[AI in education | AI]] cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[00:16:09]</a>.

The ideal usage involves teachers regularly integrating [[AI in education | AI]] into their routines, creating habits around using it for assignments, data analysis, and student accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[00:15:13]</a>.

### Policy and District-Level Adoption

School districts are rapidly adopting [[AI in education | AI]], seeing it as a primary driver for productivity and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[00:19:11]</a>. Teachers have already embraced it due to its ability to streamline planning and grading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[00:19:30]</a>.

[[AI in education | AI]] offers a significantly cheaper alternative to previous interventions. For example, after the pandemic, $86 billion was spent on ESSER funds for remediation, much of which went into expensive live tutoring ($25-$50 per hour) with limited results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[00:19:52]</a>. In contrast, [[AI in education | AI]] solutions like Khanmigo cost $10-$15 per year and offer more "dosage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[00:20:18]</a>.

Districts using Khanmigo report saving teachers at least 5 hours per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[00:21:03]</a>. It's also being used as a recruiting and retention tool for teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[00:21:06]</a>.

### Necessary Enhancements Beyond Core Models

Building effective [[AI in education | AI]] for classrooms requires substantial development beyond just integrating large language models (LLMs):
*   **Safety and Moderation**: Implementing robust safety measures and moderation tools, initially overly conservative, but now more refined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[00:21:48]</a>.
*   **Math Accuracy**: Significant work is needed to reduce math errors, especially in complex evaluation scenarios where students are "hammering" the system or switching contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[00:22:07]</a>.
*   **User Interface**: Creating a natural and intuitive user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[00:22:35]</a>.
*   **Proactive AI Architecture**: Re-engineering the front end for a proactive, [[ai_inference_and_compound_ai_systems | AI]]-first approach, moving beyond a simple chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[00:22:41]</a>.
*   **Integrated Tools**: Integrating various [[AI in education | AI]] functionalities like brainstorming for thesis statements, outlining tools, and drafting assistance directly into the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   **Prompt Chaining**: Developing robust systems for "prompt chaining" behind the scenes, allowing a single app to perform multiple [[AI in education | AI]] actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **Robust Memory**: Enhancing the [[AI in education | AI]]'s memory to give models more context, with options to reset or manage specific aspects of memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[00:23:58]</a>.
*   **Advanced Voice Integration**: Integrating advanced voice capabilities for more natural interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[00:24:26]</a>.
*   **Higher Quality Question Generation**: Improving the models' ability to create higher-quality questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[00:24:58]</a>.
*   **Visual Work Recognition**: Enabling the [[AI in education | AI]] to see and provide feedback on students' handwritten work, especially on tablet devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[00:25:32]</a>. This could make [[AI tutoring systems | AI tutoring]] indistinguishable from human tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[00:26:07]</a>.

### Model Evaluation

Khan Academy uses a rigorous [[ai_production_and_evaluation_techniques | model evaluation]] framework:
*   **Tough Test Cases**: A series of hundreds of "tough test cases" where models initially struggled (e.g., fractional representations, distributive property) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[00:29:16]</a>. Initially, models failed on 70% of these hard cases; now, they fail on less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:46:00">[00:29:46]</a>.
*   **Machine Labeling**: Using [[AI in education | AI]] to analyze [[AI in education | AI]] interactions and identify potential errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Human Labeling**: Human reviewers analyze sample conversations (e.g., 2,000 conversations were reviewed six months ago) to confirm errors and assess the "productivity" of conversations (e.g., student engagement vs. disengagement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:27:00">[00:30:27]</a>.

### Future Classroom Vision (20 years out)

A great classroom in 20 years will still prioritize active engagement, interaction, and problem-solving, but with [[AI in education | AI]] enabling teachers to have "superpowers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:14">[00:02:14]</a>. [[AI in education | AI]] will free up teachers' time from grading and lesson planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. It will provide better insights into student progress and offer more interactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[00:03:31]</a>.

The future classroom will feature ambient [[AI in education | AI]] observing and supporting learning without requiring constant screen interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[00:03:50]</a>. Additionally, mainstream virtual and augmented reality, combined with [[AI in education | generative AI]], will allow for immersive simulations, like a "magic school bus ride" to ancient Rome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[00:04:10]</a>.

The ideal is for [[AI in education | AI]] to prompt the teacher when a student is struggling, allowing the teacher to assign a specific [[AI tutoring systems | AI tutoring]] session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:00">[00:34:44]</a>. This "teacher in the loop" approach ensures accountability and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:45:00">[00:34:45]</a>.

## Skills for the Future Workforce

Core skills like critical thinking, writing, reading, math, and general knowledge remain essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:59:00">[00:42:59]</a>. However, the ability to act as an "entrepreneur" — taking existing resources and combining them in new permutations to create value — will become increasingly crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:26:00">[00:43:26]</a>. This means individuals will need to continually experiment with new tools and integrate [[AI in education | AI]] into their workflows to accelerate productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[00:43:55]</a>.

For example, using [[AI coding assistants and their uses | AI]] to transcribe verbal thoughts and generate a first draft of a speech can save hours, but still requires human refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:16:00">[00:46:16]</a>. Similarly, [[AI coding assistants and their uses | AI]] can generate entire apps, but human input and understanding are still needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:33:00">[00:46:33]</a>. This highlights the need for a hybrid approach where individuals learn both traditional skills and how to leverage [[AI in education | AI]] tools.

## The Broader AI in Education Market

The [[AI and education technology | AI in education technology]] market is currently noisy, with many startups offering thin "prompting layers" over existing [[AI models and educational engagement | AI models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:23:00">[00:38:23]</a>. While [[AI in education | AI]] can accelerate app development, the low switching costs and barriers to entry make it a challenging environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[00:38:46]</a>.

Non-profits like Khan Academy have an advantage due to their ability to take a longer-term view on development and build trust within the education community regarding pedagogy, efficacy, and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[00:39:06]</a>.

Other areas ripe for [[AI in education | AI]] innovation include:
*   **Interviewing and Assessment**: Addressing inefficiencies in the hiring process, which often involves extensive, non-standardized, and expensive assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:33:00">[00:40:33]</a>. [[AI in education | AI]] could streamline initial screenings and provide standardized certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:13:00">[00:41:13]</a>.
*   **Corporate Training**: Making mandatory corporate training (e.g., cyber security, sexual harassment) more engaging through [[AI in education | AI]] simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:11:00">[00:42:11]</a>.

## [[role_of_ai_in_education | Impact of AI on Education]]

AI is poised to significantly [[future_of_ai_in_education | change education]], though the full extent of this transformation is not yet understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>. Current discussions often focus on concerns like using AI for cheating and the challenges this poses for student evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>. However, this narrow focus overlooks AI's potential as a "magical tool to learn things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.

### Learning with AI

AI can facilitate interactive, engaging, and memorable learning experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>. For example, a child can engage in a live conversation with an AI agent to interactively learn about a topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>. This represents a vast potential for AI in learning that is not yet sufficiently discussed in the public sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. AI tools could potentially do a much better job at explaining concepts and forming curricula than traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.

## Unconventional Applications of AI

Beyond well-known areas like autonomous vehicles and general AI research, there are exciting and unconventional applications of AI that can have a significant global impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

### AI in Plant-Based Food Design (Cheese)

One particularly exciting area is the use of AI techniques to design new everyday products, such as plant-based cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>. This involves building a casein equivalent from plant products, aiming for a more affordable and sustainable alternative to traditional dairy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. AI can explore the vast design space for non-animal-based cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. Successful examples include blue cheese that is indistinguishable from its cow-based counterpart and is served in top restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>.

This application demonstrates the potential of "AI plus something that you don't think about when you think about technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:54">[01:11:54]</a>. Such innovations can have a massive [[influence_of_ai_on_economics_and_societal_transformation | impact]] due to the scale of industries like animal farming and milk production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. The ability to connect AI tools with non-technology fields can unlock many exciting developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.

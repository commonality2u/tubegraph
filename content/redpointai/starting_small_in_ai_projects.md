When embarking on [[product_development_and_prioritization_in_ai_startups | AI projects]], a recommended approach is to always start small and progressively build up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This incremental advancement should be rigorously justified by [[lean_startup_principles_applied_to_ai | ROI]] (Return on Investment), ensuring that progress is made on aspects that truly matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Experimental Mindset

AI development should be viewed as a scientific endeavor, akin to [[experimentation_in_ai_and_data_science | data science]] in its literal sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It's often challenging to predict whether AI will be effective for a specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Therefore, the strategy is to run experiments and try things out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Initial Steps for [[creative_process_and_experimentation_with_ai | Experimentation]]

The journey can begin with minimal investment, such as spending a small amount (e.g., 20 cents) on platforms like OpenAI or Llama on DataBricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This allows for a "litmus test" to gauge AI's suitability for a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

To maximize the chance of success, one should:
*   Utilize the best possible AI model available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   Start with simple prompting, or manually provide a few relevant documents into the context to see the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

The goal at this stage is to determine if there's any value or "there there" before investing further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Iterative Scaling and Refinement

Once initial value is established, the project can scale up:
1.  **Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: If initial tests show promise, the next step might involve implementing more sophisticated RAG techniques to integrate proprietary data, as models cannot inherently access internal enterprise data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  **Fine-tuning**: If significant value is being derived, fine-tuning the model can be considered <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While this involves higher upfront costs, it often leads to improved quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Benchmarking for Progress
A crucial part of this iterative process involves building and testing benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It's common to find that initial benchmarks are inadequate, necessitating the development of better ones over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

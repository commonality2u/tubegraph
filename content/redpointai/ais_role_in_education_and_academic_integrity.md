[[Impact of AI on teachers and students | Artificial intelligence (AI)]] is poised to transform educational institutions, influencing how students learn and communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Initially, there was a tendency among educators to ban AI tools, but this stance has largely dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. The current focus is on equipping graduates with critical AI skills for the workforce, emphasizing responsible integration into pedagogical methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

## Current Applications and Academic Integrity

Grammarly, an [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI-powered writing assistant]], has engaged with numerous educators and higher education institutions, finding a general eagerness to partner with industry on AI integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

### Citing AI Use

One key development in maintaining academic integrity is the ability to cite AI use in academic work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. This feature allows students to transparently indicate when and how they used an AI tool, differentiating between outright AI generation and AI-assisted co-piloting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.

For example:
*   **Student A** might use Grammarly to generate an entire essay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.
*   **Student B** might write an essay and then use Grammarly to ask for feedback on specific paragraphs, inquire about data needs, or seek advice on persuasiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>. This active engagement with the tool helps deepen understanding, whereas Student A does not engage with the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. Citation allows educators to distinguish these two different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.

This approach reflects the creativity seen in educational institutions as they adapt to new technologies, similar to how calculators and online code snippets were once considered cheating but are now accepted tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>.

### Authorship Tracking

To further enhance transparency, Grammarly is launching a feature called "Authorship," which provides provenance for every part of a document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. This tool can identify:
*   Manually written sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>
*   Content cut and pasted from elsewhere and potentially paraphrased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>
*   AI-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>

Authorship allows educators to set their own rules on what is acceptable and what is not for assignments, providing a framework for responsible AI use in the classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

## Future Outlook for AI in Education

AI is seen as a tool for augmentation, providing "superpowers" to individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. In the next 10 years, students are expected to use AI as a powerful tool to engage more deeply with material, receive real-time feedback, and upskill effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

### AI as a Leveler

AI also serves as a "great leveler," especially in parts of the world with limited access to educational resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. For many, the choice is not between a teacher and AI, but between not studying at all or using AI to facilitate learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This broadens access to what's possible in education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.

### Overhyped vs. Underhyped Aspects

In the broader [[role_of_ai_in_education | AI in education]] landscape:
*   **Overhyped:** Chat interfaces, which are considered subpar command-line interfaces that should fade into the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.
*   **Underhyped:** AI's potential to upskill and uplevel people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. AI acts as a "force multiplier" to enhance skills, particularly for those struggling or lacking access to traditional education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. Initial studies suggest AI tools are most impactful for users in the bottom half of ability, offering compelling possibilities for widespread implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>.

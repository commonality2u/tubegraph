Existing platforms like Snapchat and TikTok have historically focused on vertical video, aiming to enable creators to easily produce content using mobile cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, a key value proposition for new platforms could be to render the camera obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Dilemma of AI-Generated Content

A significant challenge for current mobile platforms involves how to rank and recommend [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_integration|AI-generated content]] when it constitutes a small percentage (e.g., 10%) compared to the majority of camera-based content (90%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The question arises whether to mix these content types together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The critical juncture arrives if the ratio of [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_integration|AI-generated content]] to camera-based content reaches 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In such a scenario, existing content creators might experience a significant reduction in views and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Emergence of New Platforms

Should this stage be reached, there will be a necessity to construct entirely new platforms specifically designed for [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_integration|AI-generated content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This represents a significant new opportunity for the development of such specialized platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

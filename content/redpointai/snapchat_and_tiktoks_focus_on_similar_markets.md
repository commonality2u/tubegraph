Snapchat and TikTok have concentrated their efforts on similar end markets, including the development of [[future_of_interactive_avatars_and_synchronous_streaming | avatars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. For incumbents, particularly in vertical video, a key objective has been to enable creators to easily produce video content using the [[impact_of_mobile_cameras_on_video_creation | mobile camera]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Divergence with AI-Generated Content

A new platform's value proposition diverges from this, aiming to make the camera "obsolete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. A dilemma arises for existing mobile platforms regarding the integration of [[ai_usecases_with_product_market_fit | AI-generated content]]. If 10% of content is [[ai_usecases_with_product_market_fit | AI-generated]] today, platforms face challenges in ranking and recommending it compared to the 90% that is camera-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The situation intensifies if this ratio shifts to 50% [[ai_usecases_with_product_market_fit | AI-generated content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. If both types of content are presented together, existing camera-based creators could experience a significant decrease in views and attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Opportunities for New Platforms

Should this stage be reached, it would necessitate the development of a [[potential_opportunities_for_platforms_specializing_in_ai_content | new platform]] specifically designed for [[ai_usecases_with_product_market_fit | AI-generated content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This represents a significant [[potential_opportunities_for_platforms_specializing_in_ai_content | new opportunity]] in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

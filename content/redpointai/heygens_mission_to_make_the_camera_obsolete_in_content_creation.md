A "new platform" aims to redefine content creation by rendering the mobile camera obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This approach diverges significantly from established vertical video platforms like Snapchat and TikTok, whose core idea was to enable creators to easily produce videos using mobile cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Contrasting with Incumbents

While Snapchat and TikTok have focused on similar end markets and avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, their emphasis remains on camera-based creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The "new platform's" key value proposition is to move beyond this, aspiring to make the camera entirely unnecessary for content generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Rise of AI-Generated Content

A dilemma arises for existing mobile platforms as [[the_impact_of_ai_generated_content_on_current_content_creators | AI-generated content]] becomes more prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. If 10% of content is currently AI-generated, questions emerge about how to rank and recommend it alongside the 90% that is camera-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Implications for Existing Creators

The challenge intensifies if the ratio shifts to 50% [[the_impact_of_ai_generated_content_on_current_content_creators | AI-generated content]] and 50% camera-based content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In such a scenario, mixing these content types could lead to existing content creators receiving fewer views and less attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Need for New Platforms

If the stage where [[the_impact_of_ai_generated_content_on_current_content_creators | AI-generated content]] significantly competes with traditional content arrives, there will be a necessity to build a new platform specifically for AI-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This represents a new opportunity for platforms focused on this emerging technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

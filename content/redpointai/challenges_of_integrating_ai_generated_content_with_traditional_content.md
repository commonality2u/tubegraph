The emergence of [[the_impact_of_ai_generated_content_on_current_content_creators | AI generated content]] presents a significant dilemma for existing platforms, particularly regarding its integration with traditional, camera-based content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Diverging Platform Focuses

Traditional platforms like Snapchat and TikTok have focused on enabling [[the_impact_of_ai_generated_content_on_current_content_creators | creators]] to produce video content easily using mobile cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. In contrast, new platforms aim to make the camera "obsolete" by generating content through AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Integration Dilemma

A key challenge for mobile platforms is how to rank and recommend AI-generated content alongside camera-based content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. If, for instance, 10% of content is AI-generated today, platforms must decide how it compares to the remaining 90% of camera-based content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Impact on Existing Creators

The problem intensifies if the ratio of AI-generated content to camera-based content shifts to 50/50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In such a scenario, existing [[the_impact_of_ai_generated_content_on_current_content_creators | content creators]] relying on traditional methods would likely experience significantly fewer views and less attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Future of Content Platforms

This potential shift suggests a future where [[the_future_of_ai_platforms_in_content_creation | new platforms]] may need to be built specifically for [[the_impact_of_ai_generated_content_on_current_content_creators | AI generated content]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This represents a new opportunity for dedicated AI-centric platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The landscape of [[enterprise_ai_adoption_challenges | enterprise AI adoption]] and usage is rapidly evolving, presenting various models for deployment and unique challenges for organizations looking to integrate Generative AI (GenAI) solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Current Deployment Models

Currently, there are several observed models for GenAI deployments in enterprises:
*   **Consulting-led** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>: Large consulting firms like Accenture come in to build custom solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Forward-deployed engineering/product** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>: Similar to the Palantir-esque model, involving engineers building products on-site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Out-of-the-box product** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>: Selling a ready-to-use product that enterprises are expected to implement themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

In the long term (5-10 years), a middle-ground approach is expected to prevail, acknowledging that enterprises will still require some degree of support to integrate this new, complicated technology effectively into the economy and various applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_enterprise_ai_deployment | Challenges in Enterprise AI Deployment]]

[[enterprise_adoption_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] are unique in that they require extensive access to enterprise data and systems to drive automation effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This presents several [[enterprise_ai_adoption_challenges | challenges]]:
*   **Privacy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>: Agents need to access emails, chats, calls, CRM, ERP, and HR software, demanding a degree of access rarely seen in other enterprise software, making privacy a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Custom Integration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>: Each company uses a unique "tapestry" or "mosaic" of software, necessitating custom setup to bring all context together and integrate it into the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Guardrails** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>: Due to the high stakes of mistakes, particularly with sensitive data like salary or customer information, significant guardrails are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. While self-serve setup for agents would be helpful, a middle ground is expected where parts are automated but not the entire process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Successful Enterprise Use Cases for GenAI

Companies like Coher observe what GenAI applications currently have product-market fit within enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>:
*   **Vertical Applications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>: In healthcare, GenAI is being used to simplify note-taking and form-filling for doctors by passively listening to doctor-patient interactions and pre-populating information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **General Categories (Cross-Vertical)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>:
    *   **Customer Support** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>: The technology is ready, and there's a strong need across various verticals like telco, healthcare, and financial services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   **Research Augmentation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>: Augmenting humans with agents that can perform a month's worth of research in a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This capability can make knowledge work, such as for wealth managers, significantly more effective by allowing models to read vast amounts of data and provide robust, cited research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This use case is considered ready for prime time and will be integrated into every enterprise globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

## [[trends_in_ai_model_training_and_deployment | Trends in AI Model Training and Deployment]]

### The Role of Reasoning Models
Reasoning capabilities are crucial for AI models, allowing the technology to allocate different amounts of energy based on problem complexity, unlike non-reasoning models that treat all inputs similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Reasoning has led to a "complete step change" in model improvement, enabling models to accomplish tasks that were previously impossible due to their ability to reflect, understand failures, and find alternative paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Evolution of Model Capabilities
Current models lack the ability to learn from experience, akin to humans starting as novices and becoming experts over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This capability, including learning from user feedback, is a clear missing property of intelligence that needs to be developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

The "scale is all you need" hypothesis is breaking, as diminishing returns from capital and compute are evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Future progress will require smarter and more creative approaches beyond simply throwing more money at compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Custom vs. General Models
While models are becoming capable of self-developing internal experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, custom models remain important for integrating fundamental context about specific businesses or domains that is not available on the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This includes data from manufacturing, customer transactions, or detailed personal health records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

General models are extraordinary, and synthetic data can significantly bridge the gap in specialized domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. It's unlikely that organizations will operate with tens or hundreds of models; instead, a handful of customized models may suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

### Data Labeling and Synthetic Data
Human data remains necessary but is often too expensive to gather at scale, especially from experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. For example, finding 100,000 doctors to teach a model medicine is not viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. The ability to teach models general conversation skills allows for synthetic data generation, which can then be applied to specific domains using a much smaller pool of human-provided, trustworthy data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. In verifiable domains like code and math, checking results makes filtering synthetic data easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. For companies like Coher, an overwhelming majority of data generated for new models is synthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

Human involvement is indispensable for evaluation (Eval) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

## Cohere's Approach to [[enterprise_partnerships_and_ai_application_deployment | Enterprise Partnerships and AI Application Deployment]]

Cohere is pushing into the application layer with its platform "North," motivated by seeing customers repeatedly building the same applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. These applications, often built by internal AI teams (not product teams), could take a year and lacked user-friendliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

North aims to solve this by providing a consumer-grade product experience that is intuitive, low-latency, and equipped with enterprise features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>:
*   **Customization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>: UI customization, rebranding, custom data connections, tool integration, and even plugging in other fine-tuned models like Llama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Deployment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>: Sets companies forward 12-18 months in their product roadmap, enabling immediate distribution of technology to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
*   **Strategic Attributes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>: Not locked into one hyperscaler ecosystem, deployable anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Releases weights non-commercially and supports VPC deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

This vertically integrated approach, where models and applications are built together, offers more levers to deliver the desired customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. For example, Cohere's Command generative model is optimized for use cases needed in North, such as interacting with ERP or CRM systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

## [[developing_and_utilizing_ai_models_in_the_tech_industry | Developing and Utilizing AI Models in the Tech Industry]]

### Team Expertise
Building the best AI products often requires deep model knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. Even if teams aren't training models themselves, they try to approximate that impact at the model layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Companies like Cohere aim to provide this deep model intervention for their partners, ensuring needs are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

### Future Use Cases
Beyond current applications, mundane back-office tasks are expected to come online as infrastructure for automation (like North) is put in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. This includes tasks in finance, legal, and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Sales, for example, involves extensive research (company strategy, internal conversations, individual briefings) that can be dramatically enhanced by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

### Consolidation vs. Federation of AI Solutions
Initially, enterprises may experience a "scattershot phase" where different teams purchase disparate applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. However, this will lead to an "insane maintenance burden" due to numerous data source connections across different apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. This will drive a strong push towards consolidation, with enterprises seeking a single platform plugged into everything to manage all automation objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

## [[economic_and_strategic_considerations_in_ai_model_deployment | Economic and Strategic Considerations in AI Model Deployment]]

### Strategic Decisions
*   **Location** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>: Starting up in Toronto, leveraging the strong Canadian AI ecosystem (e.g., Jeff Hinton, Ilia Sutskever's origins), has provided access to top talent and made Cohere a "darling" of the Canadian tech community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.
*   **International Partnerships** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>: Cohere actively partners with companies like Fujitsu in Japan and LG in Korea, investing deeply in non-English languages to ensure their technology works well in those jurisdictions and supports local economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. An open-source project, "Coher.ai," collected data from thousands of native speakers across over a hundred languages to improve models for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

### Differentiation of Foundation Model Companies
In the future, there will likely be a handful of foundation model companies, each finding their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. For example, OpenAI focuses on the consumer front, Anthropic excels at code, and Cohere is focused on enterprise and back-office applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. New generations of foundation models are also expected for specific domains like biology, chemistry, and material science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.

### Hardware and Compute Trends
Test-time compute requires significant resources, making inference 3 to 10 times more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. However, compute is expected to become cheaper and more abundant per flop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>. The emergence of multiple options for training compute and the ability to combine different chip types for supercomputers are positive trends for AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.

### Future Model Milestones
A significant future milestone for models is the ability to learn from experience and user interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. This could involve storing interaction history in a database that models can query for context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. Such models would grow with users, learning preferences and improving over time, fostering a stronger connection with the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.

### AI Risks and Societal Impact
Concerns exist regarding:
*   **Bad Actors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>: Potential access to powerful AI capabilities at the state level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. Ensuring liberal democracies gain an advantage is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.
*   **Job Displacement** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>: The need for infrastructure to facilitate moving and retraining people into new, more fulfilling careers if particular jobs are impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

However, mass unemployment is not anticipated, as humanity has "infinite demand," and the technology is expected to augment people, allowing them to do more and deliver more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. Concerns about existential risks like "Terminator" scenarios are considered less urgent than near- and mid-term issues that require focus from the public and policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>.

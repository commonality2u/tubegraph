[[AI in education | AI]] is expected to be one of the first areas to see mainstream adoption for productivity and learning, transforming education for students, teachers, and school systems alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A primary focus of [[AI and education technology | AI and education technology]] development, particularly for organizations like Khan Academy, is to enhance student and teacher engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Enhancing Classroom Engagement with AI

Ideally, a great classroom is characterized by active student engagement, interaction, and hands-on activities, rather than passive listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Teachers in such environments walk around, working with students to facilitate interesting activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. [[AI in education | AI]] can empower more teachers by:
*   Freeing up time from administrative tasks like lesson planning and grading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   Providing insights into student progress and classroom management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   Facilitating better interactivity with students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

In the future, classrooms could incorporate ambient [[AI in education | AI]] that observes and provides insights without requiring constant screen interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Additionally, advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), combined with generative [[AI in education | AI]], could enable immersive simulations, allowing students to experience virtual worlds, such as "literally like a magic school bus ride" back to ancient Rome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Khan Academy's Approach to Engagement

Khan Academy's core mission is to personalize education, replicating the effectiveness of a good tutor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This long-standing goal has been significantly advanced by generative [[AI in education | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Khanmigo: AI-Powered Tutoring
KIGO (Khanmigo), Khan Academy's [[AI tutoring systems | AI-powered tutoring assistant]], serves both students and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. It has been deployed to over 1.4 million students and teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, with districts paying around $15 per year for its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

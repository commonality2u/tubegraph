Adobe's Vice President of Generative AI and Sensei, Alexandre Cen, envisions a future where artificial intelligence deeply transforms content creation and user interaction within Adobe's Creative Cloud suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This transformation aims to make creativity more accessible and personalizable than ever before.

## Creative Cloud's Evolution: From Designers to Creative Directors

Adobe foresees [[Adobes integration of AI in content creation | Creative Cloud]] evolving to empower customers to transition from visual designers to "creative directors" of "meta experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>. This shift suggests that AI will handle more of the granular design tasks, allowing users to focus on higher-level conceptualization and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>.

The historical pattern of technological disruption in content production, such as digital publishing, photography, the internet, and mobile, shows that as creation becomes cheaper and easier, the demand for content increases exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Adobe believes that by embracing AI, creative professionals will remain relevant and become significantly more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. It is anticipated that the majority of content will be touched by AI, even if not fully generated, primarily through editing and partial generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Hyper-Personalization and Content Velocity

A significant problem Adobe is addressing, particularly for enterprises, is the "content velocity" or "content supply chain" bottleneck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. Businesses struggle to communicate with customers in an individualized or segmented manner due to the high cost and impossibility of human management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:44">[00:50:44]</a>.

[[Integration of AI in Salesforce products | Generative AI]] is seen as the solution to this by enabling "hyper-personalization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>. This means both large and small enterprises, and even individuals, can generate infinite content personalized to the viewer, potentially down to a "segment of one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. For example, a user visiting a website might see images and content specifically tailored to their preferences, provided they have opted in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>. This will enable brands and small businesses to communicate differently and more effectively with their constituents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

## Future of Human-Computer Interaction

The interaction model for creativity is still evolving, but Adobe anticipates a mix of language-based prompts, pointing, and sliders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. While prompt-based UIs lower the barrier to entry, particularly for Photoshop novices, professional users demand more control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

Adobe is investing in both easier user-computer dialogue and more robust control mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. The goal is a more fluid and less convoluted human-computer interaction, making tools more accessible to larger audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.

## [[The future of AI platforms in content creation | AI at the Core]] of Software Development

Cen believes that [[Future of software development and AI | software companies will become AI companies]] in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. While they might not explicitly call themselves "AI companies," AI will simply be a "new way of software" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:13">[00:49:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>. [[Role of AI in Future Business Operations | AI will replace more and more of the software stack]], enabling amazing experiences in content creation and editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>. Adobe emphasizes not falling in love with a particular model architecture, as innovation in the space is exponential, constantly leading to better quality and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

[[AI models and educational engagement | AI]] has fundamentally transformed the music industry, with Suno emerging as a prominent example due to its viral success and user engagement. With over 10 million users who have generated songs and a recent fundraise of $125 million, Suno's CEO, Mikey Shulman, highlights the crucial role of community and user experience in its development and future vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## User Engagement Models

Suno identifies two primary categories of users:

*   **Casual Users (Soundtracking Life)**: These users leverage Suno to narrate their daily lives musically, creating songs about happy, sad, funny, or memorable moments, such as a barista getting their name wrong or unexpected package deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Music serves as a way to tell stories, a practice humans have engaged in for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Power Users (Creative Outlet)**: This group uses Suno as a significant creative outlet, enjoying both the process of making music and the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. They spend hours crafting songs to tell a specific story or actualize a sound in their head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

A key learning from power users is that many people possess great musical taste and ideas but lack the traditional means or complex tools (like Ableton or Protools) to execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Suno aims to reimagine music creation processes through technological breakthroughs, making it accessible and enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Overcoming the "Blank Canvas" Problem

Many [[AI models and educational engagement | AI]] products face a "blank canvas" problem, where users are unsure how to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. While Suno hasn't fully solved this, they acknowledge it's an area for future improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Current approaches include:

*   **Suggestions in the text box**: Providing a starting point for prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Themed experiences**: Like a Valentine's Day experience, where the reason to make a song is clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This helps users realize that reasons to make a song already exist, similar to sending a text or taking a picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Future intuitive prompting**: Moving beyond text to allow users to express themselves through mood, visuals, or sounds (e.g., humming a melody, tapping a beat, or turning everyday sounds into music) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

> [!TIP] Early-stage [[AI models and educational engagement | AI]] tools are often text-driven, indicating significant room for growth in developing more intuitive user interaction methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## The Social and Collaborative Future of Music

Suno emphasizes the social aspect of music, aiming to foster co-creation and shared experiences. This aligns with the idea that making music with others can be one of life's most enjoyable moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

*   **Sharing**: Suno already enables users to share songs with small groups of friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Multiplayer Creation**: A major future focus is on "everything multiplayer," allowing users to make music together synchronously (like a jam session) or asynchronously (sending half a song for completion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This envisions music as a fluid conversation, allowing users with varying skills to express ideas, react, and riff off each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   **Interactive Concerts**: Observing a Twitch streamer using Suno to perform an interactive digital concert to a large audience demonstrated the potential for group experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. The ability for viewers to micropay and interact with the streamer transforms a sterile digital concert into an engaging, communal event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## Community's Role in Evaluation and Feedback

Unlike text models with objective reasoning benchmarks, music quality is highly subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Suno's approach to [[AI evaluation and benchmarking | model evaluations]] incorporates:

*   **Automatic Metrics**: For objective elements like audio quality, though these are often flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
*   **Human Evaluation**: Relying on people who deeply love and enjoy music to make judgment calls, as "aesthetics matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. The ultimate test is how much users love the music produced and the level of control they have over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   **User Feedback Loop**: Suno benefits from a large and engaged user base who provide implicit feedback (model usage, choice between models) and explicit feedback through their Discord community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. This community helps identify issues, such as songs ending unreliably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

## Learnings from Discord Community Engagement

Initially, Suno anticipated a prolonged reliance on Discord, similar to other [[AI models and educational engagement | AI]] consumer apps like Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. However, upon launching a thin web app, 90% of usage shifted to the web within five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.

*   **Experience vs. Platform**: Discord, while an amazing messaging platform, was not the right place for an "all-encompassing music experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. The entire user experience needs to be pleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>.
*   **Community Value**: Despite the platform shift, the Discord community remains an invaluable resource for product development, providing critical feedback and insights, effectively "crowdsourcing prompt engineering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.
*   **User Pride**: Users often edit song titles to include their names when their creations hit the trending page, demonstrating a strong sense of pride in what they've made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>. This pride is something Suno aims to lean into, making it easy for users to share and feel good about their creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.

## Broader Market Perspective

The market for [[AI models and educational engagement | AI]] music is seen as incredibly vast and Green Field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. Mikey Shulman believes that multiple companies will thrive, catering to different niches:

*   **Professional Artists**: Tools for professional artists will emerge and grow, increasing the quality and quantity of music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>.
*   **Background Music**: A huge business, as seen in the prevalence of background music in YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
*   **General Consumers**: Suno's primary focus is on building experiences for the average person, expanding music's importance and joy in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

Regarding [[AI research and innovation | IP partnerships]] and artist imitation, Suno has intentionally avoided direct artist partnerships that allow users to create new songs "in the style of" specific artists without explicit consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. Such viral moments are considered a "flash in the pan" that ultimately fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. The focus remains on enabling users to create music relevant to *them* and enjoy the process of creation itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>.

## Hot Takes

*   **Open Source [[AI infrastructure and tooling | AI]] is Overhyped**: While open-source software is amazing, [[AI infrastructure and tooling | open source AI]] is challenging due to the significant compute barriers and lack of explicit financial incentives required to produce state-of-the-art models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.
*   **Music is Underhyped**: Beyond [[AI models and educational engagement | AI]], music as a fundamental part of people's lives and its potential for greater impact is generally underhyped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

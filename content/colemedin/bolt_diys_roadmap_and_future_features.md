This announcement significantly boosted the [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | community]] and project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The focus is now on maintaining momentum to develop the best open-source [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | AI coding assistant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

This article provides [[recent_updates_and_features_in_bolt_new_fork | updates]], [[resources_and_tools_for_hosting_and_troubleshooting_bolt_diy | resources]], and a revamped [[future_vision_and_goals_for_bolt_diy | roadmap]] for the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The team is committed to a long-term [[future_vision_and_goals_for_bolt_diy | vision]] for [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | Bolt DIY]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, including features like a prompt library for different LLMs and a plug-in system for extensibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Bolt DIY Roadmap Overview

The [[future_vision_and_goals_for_bolt_diy | Bolt DIY roadmap]] is designed to provide a shared sense of direction for the open-source project, with no fixed timelines, as it is subject to change based on [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | collective vision casting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It is a guiding pillar, accessible via links in the description, readme, and documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Past Milestones and Foundations

The roadmap traces the Genesis of [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | Bolt DIY]] (originally Bolt.new) and its progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Completed items include:
*   Adding the ability to use different LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Creating the core maintainer team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Launching the [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   Improving documentation and FAQs to a V1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Enhancing the repository with CI/CD, issue templates, and releases, establishing a strong project foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Becoming the official open-source Bolt.new, a significant partnership that occurred recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This partnership also provides financial incentives for the project (not for the speaker) through collaborations with StackBlitz, including hosting events with cash prizes to encourage [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Recently Knocked-Out High-Priority Features

Over the past few weeks, several [[recent_updates_and_features_in_bolt_new_fork | high-priority features]] have been implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, including:
*   Loading local projects from GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   Attaching images to prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   Various settings improvements aimed at maturing the project overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Upcoming Features and Future Vision

The next phase for [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | Bolt DIY]], building on the momentum from the StackBlitz partnership, focuses on several key [[future_enhancements_and_highpriority_items_for_bolt_new | features]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>:

### Prompt Library
A crucial addition is a prompt library, as different LLMs require tailored prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The original Bolt.new prompt was specifically optimized for Claude 3.5 Sonnet to understand Vite and Tailwind configurations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. A library would provide prompts for various LLMs (e.g., Qwen, Llama 3.3, Gemini) and make them adjustable and extensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### File Walking and Diffs
Users are frequently requesting file walking and diff capabilities, similar to the commercial Bolt.new, to reduce the frequency of file rewrites by [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | Bolt DIY]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Collaboration with the StackBlitz team is planned to implement this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### One-Click Deploy to Netlify
A one-click deployment option for Netlify is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Kanban-Styled Board for PRs
To better organize the repository and manage pull requests (PRs), particularly high-priority ones, a Kanban-styled board will be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This will provide an at-a-glance view of current team and [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | community]] work, high-priority backlog items, and overall project progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Plugin System / Extension Marketplace
A significant [[future_enhancements_and_highpriority_items_for_bolt_new | future enhancement]] is the development of a plug-in system to make [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | Bolt DIY]] highly extensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This extension marketplace will simplify [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | feature contributions]] without requiring direct edits to the main repository, helping to avoid feature bloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Components of the plug-in system include:
*   A backend to manage the extension library and integrate with [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | Bolt DIY]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   A frontend for users to post their plugins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   A frontend for administrators to manage plugins within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Potential plugins envisioned include:
*   **Document Upload:** Allowing users to upload documents to provide [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | Bolt DIY]] with extra knowledge before prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Better Planning/Reasoning Model:** A plugin that enables the [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | AI coding assistant]] to reason about what it wants to produce based on a prompt (e.g., using a QwQ model) and generate a README or Markdown file before coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Supabase Integration:** Similar to what commercial Bolt.new is working on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Agentic System (Mixture of Experts):** A plugin where behind-the-scenes agents (a mixture of experts) create code instead of a single call to a single LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This could enable the use of smaller LLMs to work together for better results, expanding possibilities for the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Community Involvement and Contributions

The [[future_vision and goals for Bolt DIY | roadmap]] is dynamic and open to change, with [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | contributions]] encouraged from anyone with ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. If a desired [[future_enhancements_and_highpriority_items_for_bolt_new | feature]] is not on the roadmap or in recent PRs, users are encouraged to post their ideas in the "New Feature Discussions" subcategory of the Automator Think Tank community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Even better, users are encouraged to make a pull request and implement the feature themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

The project is currently experiencing significant momentum, and now is an opportune time for individuals to get involved in building the best open-source [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | AI coding assistant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. The [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | community]] can be joined at thinktank.automator.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

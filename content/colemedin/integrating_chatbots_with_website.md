One of the most common applications for AI agents is [[integrating_ai_chatbots_on_websites | creating a custom website chatbot]] equipped with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These chatbots can be trained on a business's specific data to answer user questions about products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Such a solution is beneficial for virtually any business with an online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Building Chatbots with Folder

Folder is a product that simplifies the process of [[building_a_no_code_website_chatbot | building custom RAG chatbots for websites]] without requiring code, often in under five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While coding AI agents is common, for certain tasks like custom chatbots, using a dedicated product like Folder is more efficient than building from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

To get started with Folder, users can visit folder.com and click "get started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The platform offers a free tier and a free trial for its premium features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Creating an Assistant

Upon creating an account, users are directed to a dashboard where they can create a new "assistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This assistant will power the website chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Configuration options for an assistant include:
*   Naming the assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Choosing an AI model, with options such as Claude and GPT, and Llama coming soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Defining conversation starters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Setting a base prompt, which provides instructions for the assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Selecting a personality for the chatbot, such as "focused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. These options allow for [[customizing_chatbots_for_business_needs | customizing chatbots for business needs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Training the Chatbot

After creating an assistant, users can upload files to train the RAG model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Folder supports various data sources:
*   PDF and text documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   Files from Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   YouTube content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   JSON APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The training process is quick; for example, five PDF and text documents can be trained in approximately 20 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Once trained, the assistant can accurately answer questions based on the provided documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Deploying the Website Chatbot

With the assistant trained, it can be integrated into a new website chatbot via the "website chatbot" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This step is part of [[building_a_chatbot_with_chatlink | building a chatbot with Chatlink]] (referencing the platform mentioned as Chatlink in the example). The chatbot can be customized further by changing:
*   The initial message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Branding elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   The popup position on the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   The ability to capture lead information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

After publishing, Folder provides an embed code that can be copied and pasted into any website, regardless of whether it's built with a landing page builder or custom-coded with frameworks like React <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This demonstrates how to [[integrating_ai_with_front_ends | integrate AI with front ends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Workflow Automations

Folder also features a "workflow view" that allows users to create automations leveraging their built assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. For instance, an assistant can be prompted to extract action items from a meeting and then send those items via text message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

These workflows can leverage the powerful assistants created within Folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. While other workflow builders exist (e.g., [[integrating_ai_agents_in_n8n_using_open_web_ui | n8n]], Zapier, Make.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, Folder's unique advantage is the direct integration of its custom-trained AI assistants into these automations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This facilitates [[integrating_ai_agents_with_live_platforms | integrating AI agents with live platforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

The platform supports various integrations for actions such as SMS, Google Drive, or [[integrating_ai_agents_with_services_like_slack | Slack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Many more features and integrations are planned for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This highlights how to [[integrating_ai_agents_with_services_like_slack_and_google_drive | integrate AI Agents with services like Slack and Google Drive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

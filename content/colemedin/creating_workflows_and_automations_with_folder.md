**folder** is a product designed to simplify the creation of custom AI agents, particularly for website chatbots, without requiring code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. It allows businesses to build custom chatbots trained on their own data to answer user questions about products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. While coding AI agents is possible, using a service like folder is recommended for custom chatbots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Getting Started with folder

To begin, users can visit folder.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a> and click "get started" to create an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. folder offers a free tier and a free trial for premium features, allowing users to explore its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.

## Building a Custom Chatbot Assistant

Upon creating an account, users are directed to a dashboard where they can create their first "assistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

The process involves:
*   Giving the assistant a name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.
*   Choosing an AI model (e.g., Claude, GPT, with Llama coming soon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>.
*   Adding conversation starters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a> and a base prompt (system message) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>.
*   Setting a personality for the assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:05">[01:29:05]</a>.

### Training with Your Data (RAG)

A key feature is the ability to upload files for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>. This trains the model on custom data to answer specific questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:06">[01:47:06]</a>. Supported file types include PDF and text documents, and data can also be uploaded from Google Drive, YouTube, or a JSON API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Training can be very quick, taking around 20 seconds for multiple documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:01">[02:05:01]</a>.

Once trained, the assistant can accurately answer questions based on the provided documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>.

### Embedding the Chatbot

The trained assistant can be added to a website chatbot by selecting the assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>. Customization options include changing the initial message, branding, and popup location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The platform also supports lead information capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>. After publishing, an embed code is provided for easy integration into any website, whether built with a landing page builder or custom-coded with frameworks like React <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:07">[02:48:07]</a>.

## Creating Workflows and Automations

folder also features a workflow view for building automations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:08">[03:03:08]</a>. This allows users to leverage the assistants built within the platform for various automated tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.

### Example Workflow
A basic example involves:
1.  Using a created assistant (e.g., "New Assistant") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
2.  Giving it a specific prompt, such as "give me the action items from the last meeting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:06">[03:13:06]</a>.
3.  Sending a text message with those action items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:09">[03:16:09]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Workflow Tools
While other workflow builders like [[workflow_automation_with_n8n | n8n]], Zapier, and Make.com exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>, folder's unique advantage is its ability to directly integrate and leverage the AI assistants created within its own platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>. These automations can perform actions across various services, including SMS, Google Drive, and Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. More integrations are anticipated in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:09">[03:40:09]</a>.

Advanced architecture is crucial for taking [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] to the next level, especially for more complex systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This phase focuses on enhancing reliability and effectiveness beyond basic [[building_ai_agents | agent construction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Key Architectural Components

### Multi-Agent Workflows
For complex systems, it is vital to implement multi-agent workflows and various architecture patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This involves distributing responsibility among different agents, similar to how responsibilities are distributed among people for enhanced power and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### Memory Systems
Incorporating robust memory systems, particularly for long-term memory, is a critical component of advanced [[defining_ai_agents | AI agent]] architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Guardrails
Guardrails are among the most important components for making [[defining_ai_agents | AI agents]] reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
-   **Input Guardrails**: These ensure that "garbage" or irrelevant/problematic data is not sent to the agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
-   **Output Guardrails**: These prevent unwanted or incorrect information from being sent to the end-user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

> [!info] Reliability and Unpredictability
> While [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] offer more power than traditional automations, they are also significantly more unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Implementing features like guardrails is essential to manage this unpredictability and ensure reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

### Fallback Mechanisms
Fallback mechanisms are another essential component to ensure the agent can handle unexpected situations or errors gracefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Learning by Doing
To gain comfortability and experience with advanced [[building_ai_agents | agent building]], it is recommended to:
-   Level up an agent previously coded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
-   Add features like long-term memory or input guardrails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
-   Combine it with another agent to build out a multi-agent workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

This hands-on approach helps make agents more reliable and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Once these advanced architectural elements are understood and implemented, the next step is to [[building_productiongrade_ai_agents | productionize our AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

## Community Foundation and Growth

The **Bolt DIY** project originated as "Autod Dev," a fork of [[bolt_new_fork_introduction_and_its_community_engagement | Bolt.new]], built by a community over several months with the aim of becoming the leading open-source AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Automator platform serves as the central hub for the [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | Autod Dev community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This community has been instrumental in the project's progress, achieving significant milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Strategic Partnership and Community Role
A strategic partnership between Automator and Stack Blitz has elevated Autod Dev to become the official open-source version of [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | Bolt.new]], leading to its renaming as **Bolt DIY** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Eric, CEO of Stack Blitz, acknowledged the significant contributions of the community in adding the capability to power the experience with any large language model (LLM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Despite the project's relatively small size in terms of active contributors, its impact on the development of AI models is described as "huge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The community's ability to share ideas and expand the project has directly influenced the [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | product roadmap]] for both **Bolt DIY** and the commercial Bolt.new, including features like persistent chat messages and rollbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Preserving Community Autonomy
A key aspect of the partnership is the assurance that the **Bolt DIY** team will retain complete creative freedom over implementations, community management, and guiding the project's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This autonomy is possible because the commercial Bolt.new will diverge from **Bolt DIY**, allowing the open-source project to implement features without concern for their relevance to Bolt.new's commercial objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The Automator Think Tank will remain the home of the **Bolt DIY** community, fostering a vibrant environment for idea sharing and collaborative development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The project's GitHub repository will move to the Stack Blitz lab organization, but will retain its stars, forks, commit history, pull requests, and issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Educational Potential

**Bolt DIY** is envisioned as an "awesome platform just to learn how to work with AI coding assistants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The project aims to bridge the knowledge gap for users who struggle with AI coding assistants, often attributing poor results to the LLM itself rather than understanding the nuances of working with it as a co-pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Real-World Testing and Experimentation
One of the primary educational benefits highlighted is **Bolt DIY**'s utility as a real-world testing ground for new AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Frontier research labs are already using **Bolt DIY** to evaluate their next-generation models because it offers a more representative test environment than traditional benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This provides a crucial "reliable target" for AI models to be tested against, enabling continuous improvement in their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The project allows users to experiment with different LLMs, including local ones, and push the limits of what's possible with AI coding assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This hands-on experience allows users to see how well models perform in practical scenarios, as exemplified by a contributor immediately testing new models like "quen 2.5 coder 32b" with **Bolt DIY** upon release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Distinguishing from Commercial Bolt.new
While Bolt.new is presented as a "stable product for you to go and very easily build anything," **Bolt DIY** is positioned as the platform for those who want to "experiment some really cool stuff, push the limits, build things yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This distinction emphasizes its role as a cutting-edge, experimental, and educational tool that will implement features faster than its commercial counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Filling a Gap
The project addresses a significant gap in the open-source world by providing good examples of production software using AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> and offering real-world applications for testing AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The ability to swap out any LLM on the fly further enhances its educational and experimental value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Creator's Perspective
The creator, with a background in Computer Science and years of coding experience, emphasizes the importance of understanding the full software engineering process beyond just coding, especially in the [[opensource_ai_coding_assistants_and_community_building | AI era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>. While [[opensource_ai_coding_assistants_and_community_building | AI coding assistants]] can handle the first 90% of coding, the remaining 10% (fixing hallucinations, productionizing, maintaining, and refactoring) requires human expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>. The community aims to foster this deeper understanding.

The [[opensource_ai_coding_assistants_and_community_building | local AI package]] is highlighted as a practical project for achieving data privacy in [[incorporating_ai_agents_and_advanced_development_features | AI applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>, and [[archon_ai_agent_builder | Archon]] is a key open-source project that the creator plans to develop further, potentially transitioning it into a more general knowledge [[incorporating_ai_agents_and_advanced_development_features | agent]] similar to Context 7 but open-source and with the power of [[incorporating_ai_agents_and_advanced_development_features | agentic workflows]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. There are also aspirations to integrate [[archon_ai_agent_builder | Archon]] with the [[openai_agent_sdk_overview | A2A protocol]] to enable seamless communication between [[incorporating_ai_agents_and_advanced_development_features | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:22">[01:58:22]</a>.

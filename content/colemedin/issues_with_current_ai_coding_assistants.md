While [[ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistants]] like Windmill or Cursor offer impressive productivity benefits, even for non-coders, they still face significant limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These tools, despite recent additions like documentation retrieval and Claude mCP support, have as many flaws as strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Key Issues

### Code Hallucinations
A primary problem is that [[ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistants]] frequently hallucinate "awful code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This occurs even when users provide extensive documentation and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This hallucination problem highlights the need for a significant upgrade in these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Lack of Specialization
Current [[ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistants]] are often "too General," acting as a "Jack of all trades but also the master of none" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This generality hinders their effectiveness when coding with diverse frameworks, tools, and libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Providing documentation for a specific framework is often insufficient, as the tools remain too general to apply it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Inconsistent and Less Robust Code Output
Unlike specialized solutions, general [[ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistants]] like Wind Surf or Cursor produce code that varies significantly with each attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This inconsistency can lead to more errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. A general coder "spewing out all the code at once" is less robust than an agent that breaks down problems into smaller steps and leverages agentic flows with built-in reasoning and system prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Challenges in Tooling and Documentation
When specific documentation is not provided for external APIs, such as the Brave API, both general [[ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistants]] and specialized agents like Archon can hallucinate incorrect URLs or parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. This highlights the need for tool libraries with pre-made, reliable tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

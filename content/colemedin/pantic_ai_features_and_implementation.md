[[pantic_ai_framework | Pantic AI]] is an open-source Python agent framework designed to simplify the development of production-grade AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It addresses the shortcomings of newer frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, and Swarm, as well as no-code agent builders, which often require significant additional work to be production-ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Core Problem Pantic AI Solves
The field of AI agents using large language models for autonomous tasks is very new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many existing frameworks overlook crucial features necessary for mature and production-ready agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. [[pantic_ai_framework | Pantic AI]] aims to make it less painful to develop these agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Key Features of Pantic AI
[[pantic_ai_framework | Pantic AI]] implements numerous important features often overlooked by other agent frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>:

*   **Context Management**: Handles important information like database connections and API keys, which is crucial for agents and often missing in other frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Error Handling and Retry Logic**: Includes robust mechanisms for handling errors and retrying operations, such as for overload errors from APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Testing and Evaluation Capabilities**: Supports testing and evaluation, allowing for mock dependencies to avoid incurring costs during unit or integration tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrates with Logfire for robust debugging and monitoring, providing a UI to visualize LLM and tool calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Large Language Model (LLM) Output Validation**: Ensures that the output from LLMs conforms to expected structured formats (e.g., specific keys in JSON) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Model Agnostic**: Supports various LLM providers and allows users to add their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It can be used with models like Gemini 1.5 Flash (Google) or GPT-4o (OpenAI), and also with local LLMs via Ollama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Type Safe**: Leverages type safety, especially for structured and stream responses, by utilizing the underlying Pydantic library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Type-Safe Dependency Injection System**: Manages context for agents, such as database connections and API keys, without exposing sensitive information to the LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Simplified Tool Integration**: Tools are easily attached to agents using a decorator, automatically handling the passing of context like API keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Results**: Provides easy access to information from results, including cost and other metadata, as well as the entire chat history after any LLM call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Underpinning Pydantic Validation
The core strength of [[pantic_ai_framework | Pantic AI]] stems from its foundation in the Pydantic validation library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Pydantic is a long-standing Python validation library, used in frameworks like FastAPI to ensure expected data types and payloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Similarly, major LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic use Pydantic as their validation layer to ensure structured output (e.g., JSON with specific keys) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This focus on validation at its core distinguishes [[pantic_ai_framework | Pantic AI]] from other frameworks that often overlook output validation, testing, or tool invocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Implementation: Building a Web Search Agent
To demonstrate [[pantic_ai_and_lang_graph_for_building_ai_agents | building AI agents using Pantic AI]], a web search agent utilizing the Brave Search API is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Prerequisites
*   Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
*   Brave Search API Key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>
*   OpenAI API Key (for GPT models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>
*   Ollama (for local LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

### Agent Construction Steps

1.  **Environment Setup**: Load API keys and model choice from a `.env` file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
2.  **LLM Configuration**:
    *   Create a custom asynchronous OpenAI instance, overriding the base URL to `localhost:11434` for Ollama if a non-GPT model (e.g., `qwen:2.5-coder-32b`) is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   Otherwise, use the standard OpenAI client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
3.  **Logfire Integration (Optional)**: Configure Logfire for enhanced logging and monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
4.  **Define Dependencies**: Use [[dynamic_system_prompts_and_dependencies_in_pantic_ai | Pantic AI's dependency injection]] system to manage `client` (HTTP client for API calls) and `brave_api_key` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This prevents sensitive credentials from being passed directly to the LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
5.  **Define the Agent**: Instantiate the agent with the chosen LLM, a system prompt (including current time for context), and the defined dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The `model_retry` parameter is set for automatic retries on specific errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
6.  **Define the Tool (`search_web`)**:
    *   Decorate a Python function with `@agent.tool` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
    *   The function accepts `context` (containing dependencies) and `query` (the LLM-defined search term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
    *   A docstring explains to the LLM when and how to use the tool, including expected arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
    *   Inside the tool, an HTTP call is made to the Brave API using the client and API key from the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
    *   Logfire `span` is used to log the API call, providing dynamic logging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
    *   The raw JSON results from the API are massaged into a readable string for the LLM to reason about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
7.  **Run the Agent**: Call `agent.run()` with the user prompt and dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The `debug` library (from [[pantic_ai_framework | Pantic AI]]) can be used to view the entire history of tool calls and responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

The agent, when queried about articles on "React 19," successfully uses the `search_web` tool to find and present relevant articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Advanced Implementation: Streamlit UI with Chat History and Streaming
An advanced version of the agent includes a Streamlit UI, demonstrating two additional [[advanced_architecture_for_ai_agents | Pantic AI]] features:

*   **Chat History**: Allows the agent to maintain a conversation context across multiple turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. The entire message history is passed to the agent, with the latest message as the current prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Text Streaming**: Provides typewriter-style output from the LLM in real-time, eliminating the need to wait for the full response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
    *   *(Note: Ollama did not support streaming with Pantic AI at the time of recording, so GPT-4o was used for this demo)* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

This implementation involves asynchronous operations to call the agent and display streaming responses in the front end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

The Streamlit demo successfully showcases persistent chat history (e.g., recalling a previous question) and web search capabilities for new queries (e.g., Elon Musk's net worth), with the response streaming in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

By leveraging these features, [[pantic_ai_framework | Pantic AI]] helps developers build robust, production-grade AI agents, enabling them to understand and implement crucial elements for Enterprise-level solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

Folder is a product that simplifies the creation of [[customizing_chatbots_for_business_needs | custom chatbots]] for websites, particularly those utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and trained on specific data to answer user questions about products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It offers a no-code solution for building these [[building_a_no_code_website_chatbot | custom RAG chatbots]] quickly, often in under five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. While coding AI agents is an option, Folder provides a streamlined alternative for this specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Getting Started with Folder

To begin using Folder, navigate to folder.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The platform offers a free tier and a free trial for its premium features, allowing users to explore its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Creating an AI Assistant

After creating an account, users are directed to a dashboard where they can create their first AI assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This assistant will power the [[integrating_chatbots_with_website | chatbot for the website]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Key steps in creating an assistant include:
*   **Naming the assistant** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Choosing an AI model:** Options include Claude and GPT, with [[building_a_powerful_chatbot_using_llama_3_1_405b | Llama]] coming soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Adding conversation starters** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Defining the base prompt:** This acts as the assistant's instructions or system message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Setting the personality:** Users can experiment with different personality types, such as "focused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Training the Assistant with RAG

Once the assistant is created, it can be trained using custom data for [[customizing_chatbot_with_rag | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **File Uploads:** Users can upload PDF and text documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Diverse Sources:** Files can also be uploaded from Google Drive, YouTube, or a JSON API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Training Speed:** Training the assistant is very fast; for example, five PDF and text documents can be processed in approximately 20 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The trained assistant can then accurately answer questions based on the uploaded documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Integrating the Chatbot into a Website

After training, the assistant can be converted into a [[building_a_chatbot_with_chatlink | website chatbot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Customization:** Options are available to change the initial message, branding, popup location, and even enable lead information capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Embedding:** After publishing, users receive embed code that can be copied and pasted into any website, regardless of whether it's built with a landing page builder or custom-coded with frameworks like React <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Workflow View for Automations

Folder also includes a workflow view, enabling users to create [[creating_workflows_and_automations_with_folder | automations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Example Workflow:** An assistant can be prompted to extract action items from meeting notes and then send those items as a text message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Assistants:** A key advantage is the ability to use the AI assistants built within Folder for these automations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Integrations:** Workflows can connect with various services like SMS, Google Drive, and Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This feature is similar to other workflow builders such as [[building_a_chatgpt_style_app_with_n8n_and_open_web_ui | n8n]], Zapier, and Make.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

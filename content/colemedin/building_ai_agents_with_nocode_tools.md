Building AI agents has evolved significantly since 2022, a period considered very early in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Initially, tools like function calling or competing LLMs like Claude or Gemini were not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A clear and simple process can help accelerate the learning curve for [[Building AI Agents | AI agent building]], allowing individuals to learn ten times faster than the speaker did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Foundational Knowledge (Phase One)

Before diving into [[Building AI Agents with no code using n8n and LangChain | no-code AI agent building]], it's crucial to establish a strong foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This includes understanding:
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: What they are and the best ones currently available, such as Claude, Gemini, and GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Local AI**: LLMs that can be run on your own computer, like Mistl or Quinn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **AI Agents vs. Traditional Automations**: Recognizing the paradigm shift that occurs when extra reasoning is added to automations through [[Building AI Agents | AI agents]], which brings more power but also unpredictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Effective Prompting**: Learning how to communicate effectively with LLMs and agents, which is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The term "prompt engineering" is often overused, but the skill itself remains important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Out-of-the-Box Tools**: Before building a custom [[Building AI Agents | AI agent]], it's important to perform due diligence to ensure a ready-made solution doesn't already exist for the problem at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Examples of out-of-the-box tools include Chat GPT, Claude Desktop (with MCP server support), Aqua Voice for voice-to-text, MEM for organization, and Perplexity for deep research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Capabilities Over Tools
A key tip is to focus on **capabilities over tools** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This means concentrating on what can be accomplished rather than getting bogged down in mastering specific tools that might quickly become irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Learning high-level skills will provide long-term benefits regardless of the tools used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Building AI Agents with No-Code Tools (Phase Two)

Even with coding experience, starting with [[No code AI agent builders | no-code tools]] is highly recommended for learning how to [[Building AI Agents | build AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Recommended Platforms and Benefits
*   **Platforms**: Popular [[No code AI agent builders | no-code platforms]] for [[Building AI Agents | AI agent building]] include [[N8N in creating AI agents | N8N]], Flowwise, Voice Flow, and Relevance AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Prototyping**: These tools are extensively used for [[Prototyping AI agents using n8n | prototyping AI agents]] due to their speed in getting agents up and running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **[[N8N in creating AI agents | N8N]]**: The speaker's favorite [[No code AI agent builders | no-code agent builder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Key Concepts to Learn with No-Code
*   **Tool Integration**: Learning how to integrate tools with agents to enable actions in services like Gmail, Slack, and Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **[[Building a nocode RAG AI agent | Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]]**: A critical process for providing external knowledge to [[Building AI Agents | AI agents]], essentially making them domain experts on specific documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. [[Building a nocode RAG AI agent | RAG]] can be implemented within [[N8N in creating AI agents | N8N]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Basic Agent Memory**: Understanding how agents remember conversations and previous messages, and how this data is stored in databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Learn by Doing
It's crucial to learn by doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. For this phase, this means building at least one, and ideally many, different agents using [[No code AI agent builders | no-code tools]] like [[N8N in creating AI agents | N8N]] to gain comfortability and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

While [[No code AI agent builders | no-code tools]] are powerful for [[Prototyping AI agents using n8n | prototyping]] and getting started quickly, for maximum flexibility, control, speed, and performance, transitioning to [[Developing AI agents without coding | building agents with code]] (specifically Python) is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. However, the high-level skills learned in the [[Building AI Agents with no code using n8n and LangChain | no-code phase]], such as tool integration, short-term memory, and [[Building a nocode RAG AI agent | RAG]], are transferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

The speaker offers an "AI Agent Mastery Course" within the Dynamis community that covers the full process from planning and [[Prototyping AI agents using n8n | prototyping with N8N]] to [[Developing AI agents without coding | building agents in Python]] and deploying full front-end applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

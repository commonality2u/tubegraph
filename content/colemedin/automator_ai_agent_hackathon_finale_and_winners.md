The Automator AI Agent Hackathon concluded with a live stream finale, celebrating the innovative [[building_ai_agents | AI agents]] developed by participants and announcing the winners. The event aimed to showcase the impressive capabilities of the community in [[building_ai_agents_for_automator_live_agent_studio | building AI agents for Automator Live Agent Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Hackathon Overview

The hackathon featured a $6,000 [[prize_breakdown_for_ai_hackathon | prize breakdown for AI Hackathon]] pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The [[judging_criteria_for_ai_hackathon | judging criteria for AI Hackathon]] primarily involved community voting, with special categories judged by industry experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. It was emphasized that all submissions were highly impressive, and not winning an award did not diminish the quality of the agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The event was a significant undertaking, requiring extensive work from the Automator team and guest judges to configure and manage submissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Prize Breakdown and Rules
*   **First Place (Best Overall Agent)**: $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>

A key rule for the [[prize_breakdown_for_ai_hackathon | prize breakdown for AI Hackathon]] was that participants would receive only the single highest prize they qualified for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. For example, if an agent won both first place overall and best Voiceflow agent, they would receive the first place prize, and the next eligible agent would receive the Voiceflow award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Guest Judges
The hackathon featured several guest judges who are also YouTubers and community figures:

## Future Outlook

The event marked a significant milestone for [[automator_enhancing_the_learning_and_application_of_ai | Automator Enhancing the learning and application of AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>. While the hackathon required immense effort, the organizers are open to hosting more hackathons in the future, possibly with specialized challenges beyond general [[building_ai_agents | AI agent building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

The Live Agent Studio will remain an open-source platform for submitting and showcasing [[building_ai_agents | AI agents]], continuing to foster a community around open-source AI innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. All submitted agents from the hackathon will remain accessible on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. Participants are encouraged to submit updates or extensions to their agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

### Introducing Archon: An AI Agent to Build Other AI Agents

A major new project, "Archon," was teased during the finale. Archon is an open-source [[building_ai_agents | AI agent]] designed to build other [[building_ai_agents | AI agents]], powered by a combination of Pydantic AI and LangGraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>. This combination is believed to be the most powerful for [[building_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>.

Archon will be developed iteratively to serve as instructional material, demonstrating how to build powerful agents with Pydantic AI and LangGraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:42">[01:20:42]</a>.
*   **Version 1**: A Pydantic AI agent that builds other Pydantic AI agents, showcasing initial capabilities and inherent weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>.
*   **Version 2**: An agentic workflow built with Pydantic AI and LangGraph that builds other Pydantic AI agents, introducing more robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>.
*   **Version 3 (Future)**: An agent that leverages Pydantic AI and LangGraph to build other agents using both frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.

Future iterations of Archon aim to include features like self-feedback loops and a tool library, where pre-packaged tools for interacting with services like Brave or Google Drive can be dynamically fetched as context for the LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:41">[01:22:41]</a>. This project emphasizes the importance of focusing on capabilities and high-level architectural concepts rather than being tied to specific tools, ensuring longevity of knowledge in the rapidly evolving AI landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:45">[01:25:45]</a>. The project also aims to make [[building_ai_agents | building AI agents]] more accessible, even for those with limited Python knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:40">[01:28:40]</a>.

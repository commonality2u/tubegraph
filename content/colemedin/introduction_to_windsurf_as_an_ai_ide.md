From: [[colemedin]] <br/> 

Windsurf is considered the premier [[ai_ides_and_platforms|AI IDE]] currently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It is lauded for combining the best aspects of both a co-pilot and an agent, allowing for easy collaboration and the execution of long-running, complex coding tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The platform is described as highly addictive and capable of delivering "insane results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The speaker has accumulated over 50 hours of experience with Windsurf, alongside [[comparison_of_windsurf_with_other_ai_tools_and_platforms|AutoDev]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

While not perfect, and other tools like [[comparison_of_windsurf_with_other_ai_tools_and_platforms|AutoDev]] or [[comparison_of_windsurf_with_other_ai_tools_and_platforms|Bolt.new]] might be preferred for initial front-end development, Windsurf significantly reduces coding time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This efficiency allows developers to focus on building high-quality, production-ready code on top of what Windsurf generates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. It excels at laying groundwork, writing tests, and documenting code, thereby freeing up developers' time for refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Flow State

Codium, the creators of Windsurf, emphasize that the platform is "built to keep you in Flow State" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This means providing a cohesive experience where the user and the [[ai_ides_and_platforms|AI agent]] interact seamlessly, preventing the feeling of separate coding and AI assistance processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The goal is to maintain a focused state for maximum developer productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Evolution of AI in Coding

Windsurf represents a significant step in the [[evolution_of_ai_ides|evolution of AI IDEs]] by integrating "flows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This progression can be seen through a timeline:
*   **2022: Manual Coding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Late 2022: Co-pilots** – Introduced [[ai_ides_and_platforms|AI help]] for small tasks like autocomplete or research, though not deeply integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **2024: Agents** – Large Language Models (LLMs) gained the ability to perform actions like generating code, running commands, and interacting with knowledge bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. However, this often came with unreasonable waiting periods, inconsistent results, and a lack of integration with the IDE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **November 2024: Flows (Windsurf)** – Introduced by Codium, "flows" provide a completely synced timeline between the user and the [[ai_ides_and_platforms|AI agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The agent is aware of user changes, and users can easily see agent changes, creating a highly integrated pair-programming experience that keeps the developer in flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Integrating Windsurf into Workflow

A common workflow involves combining Windsurf with other tools for optimal results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The speaker's preferred method includes:
1.  **Initial Front-end Development**: Building the initial front end using [[comparison_of_windsurf_with_other_ai_tools_and_platforms|AutoDev]] or [[comparison_of_windsurf_with_other_ai_tools_and_platforms|Bolt.new]] until it reaches a point where it gets stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
2.  **Transition to Windsurf**: Exporting the project and importing it into Windsurf to add finishing touches and handle mid-to-back-end tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Windsurf excels with Python coding and database management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This combined approach leverages the strengths of each platform, creating a "wonderful combination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## [[effective_strategies_for_using_windsurf_in_coding|Effective strategies for using Windsurf in coding]]

To become a power user of Windsurf and [[troubleshooting_and_optimizing_workflows_with_windsurf|optimize workflows]], several strategies are recommended:

> [!tip] Start New Conversations
> Large language models can become confused or "hallucinate" when conversations become too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. To combat this, start a brand new conversation in Windsurf by clicking the button in the top right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Although some context is lost, re-explaining the issue briefly will often resolve hallucinations and save time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Submit One Request at a Time
> Avoid giving Windsurf multiple problems to fix in a single prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Instead, break down requests and submit them one at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This patience leads to much better results and ultimately saves time, as the agent won't confuse itself trying to fulfill too many demands simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

> [!tip] Leverage Accept/Reject Changes
> Windsurf implements changes directly into the code before you accept or reject them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This allows you to test the changes in your application immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. If a change doesn't work or isn't desired, you can simply "reject" it in Windsurf, which automatically reverts the code and informs the agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Furthermore, you can accept or reject specific changes across different files, allowing for granular control over the agent's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

> [!tip] Utilize Specific File/Function Call-Outs (`@`)
> To reduce hallucinations and provide precise direction, use the `@` symbol to call out specific files or functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. For example, typing `@use_conversations` can reference a specific hook definition or its file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This ensures the agent knows exactly what part of the code to interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

> [!tip] Be Specific with Prompts (Especially Tech Stack)
> Being highly specific with prompts is crucial for effective use of any [[ai_ides_and_platforms|AI]], and particularly Windsurf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Right from the start of application creation, define your tech stack, programming languages, and technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Providing details like "FastAPI and Python for the API endpoint," "PostgreSQL hosted with Supabase," and specific schema details will guide the AI to produce desired and predictable output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

> [!tip] Use Other LLMs for Troubleshooting (e.g., 01)
> If Windsurf's underlying model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) encounters a persistent problem, leverage other LLMs like 01 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. 01 is noted to be slightly better at coding in some instances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. You can copy the code, describe the issue and error to 01, get the fix, manually apply it in Windsurf, and then continue with Windsurf's "Flow State" awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

> [!tip] Use Refactor/Explain Features for Targeted Changes
> For directed changes to specific functions or classes, use the "refactor" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. This allows you to provide instructions for editing only the selected function, honing the context and reducing hallucinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Similarly, the "explain" feature can clarify specific functions or imported code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Automate Code Documentation
> Windsurf is phenomenal for documenting code, saving significant time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. You can ask it to document specific functions, files, or even the entire project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Crucially, instruct Windsurf *not* to update the code while adding documentation to ensure it only adds comments and docstrings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. While a "add doc string" option exists, a general prompt can yield more comprehensive documentation including in-line comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

> [!tip] Automate Test Writing
> [[Benefits_and_features_of_Windsurf|Windsurf]] is very helpful for writing tests, saving time on a necessary but often tedious task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. While AI-generated tests might not always work perfectly initially, they establish boilerplate code, especially for libraries like Jest, React Testing Library, or Pytest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. This significantly reduces setup time, allowing developers to focus on tweaking tests to meet specific requirements and correct errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The capabilities of [[ai_ides_and_platforms|AI IDEs]] like Windsurf are rapidly advancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. The speaker anticipates a future where fully agentic [[ai_ides_and_platforms|IDEs]] run locally on computers, with full access to the system, capable of researching library documentation, and fully deploying built applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. Windsurf is seen as a tool that brings this future "within reach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

Windsurf is highly recommended for developers seeking to enhance their productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

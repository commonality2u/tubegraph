When performing web scraping, it is crucial to [[use_of_web_scraping_with_llms | scrape ethically]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Many websites block scrapers and explicitly request that their content not be scraped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. It is important to adhere to these rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## How to Ensure Ethical Scraping

There are several methods to check a website's policies regarding scraping:

### 1. Consult `robots.txt`

The `robots.txt` file is a standard way for websites to communicate with web crawlers and other automated agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. You can usually find this file by adding `/robots.txt` to a website's base URL (e.g., `youtube.com/robots.txt`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. This file provides rules that help you understand when and how you can scrape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Often, it may explicitly state that no scraping is allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### 2. Review Terms of Use

Another good place to check for scraping policies is the website's or platform's Terms of Use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This document helps ensure you are following the rules and scraping ethically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

The `Pydantic-AI` documentation is provided as an example of a site that is acceptable to scrape ethically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

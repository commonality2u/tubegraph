The Live Agent Studio is a community-driven platform within Automator, designed to showcase and facilitate the implementation of cutting-edge [[ai_agents_and_their_development | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. It is currently in pre-release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Overview and Goals

The primary goal of the Live Agent Studio is to establish a revolutionary and unique platform that centralizes the showcasing, open-sourcing, and community contribution of [[ai_agents_and_their_development | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. It aims to provide a space for users to try agents directly within the interface, standardize agent development for compatibility across various platforms, and implement comprehensive chat and conversation history for every agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

The platform is envisioned as a central hub for learning and [[building_ai_agents_for_automator_live_agent_studio | building AI agents]] together as a community, helping users keep pace with the rapid advancements in AI, especially in the realm of [[ai_agents_and_their_development | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Key Features

*   **Community-Driven** The platform encourages contributions from the community, allowing users to submit their own [[ai_agents_and_their_development | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   **Open Source** All agents featured on the Live Agent Studio are completely open source, with code available for viewing on GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Interactive Interface** Users can try out [[ai_agents_and_their_development | agents]] directly within the studio's interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   **Standardized Development** It provides a standardized method for [[building_ai_agents_for_automator_live_agent_studio | creating agents]], allowing compatibility regardless of the platform used (e.g., n8n, Pydantic AI, LangChain, Flowise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Full Chat and Conversation History** Every agent includes a full chat and conversation history, similar to interfaces like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

*   **Free Tokens** Users receive 100 free tokens to get started and try out agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

## Integration with Automator.ai

The Live Agent Studio is a core component of Automator, a broader platform offering tools, networking opportunities, knowledge, and resources to succeed in the AI industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Automator serves as an extension of the creator's YouTube channel, providing a community for learning about topics like n8n and local agents, trying out [[ai_agents_and_their_development | agents]], and discovering new AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## Featured Agents

Upon its pre-release, the Live Agent Studio features nine initial [[ai_agents_and_their_development | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. These include:

*   **Pydantic AI Web Researcher** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>: An advanced web research agent built with the Pydantic AI Python framework. It searches the web, summarizes articles, and uses the information to answer questions, even those beyond its training data cut-off, such as features for Gemini 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:04]</a>. It uses Claude 3.5 Haiku under the hood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.
*   **Business Idea Researcher Agent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>: Developed in collaboration with Zubar from AI Workshop, this agent scours small business forums to find problems and generate business ideas based on user-provided topics, such as artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. This workflow is built within n8n and also uses Claude 3.5 Haiku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.
*   **LinkedIn, X, and Blog Content Creator Agent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>: Developed in collaboration with Nate, another n8n content creator, this agent takes a target audience and topic to create content for LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), and a blog post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. It features real-time updates as it searches the web, summarizes research, and generates content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.

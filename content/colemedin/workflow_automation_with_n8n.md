## Workflow Triggers

[[creating_custom_ai_workflows_with_n8n | n8n]] workflows can be triggered by various events:
*   **Chat Message Reception**: A workflow can start when a chat message is received, initiating interaction with an AI agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Google Drive File Changes**: Workflows can be configured to trigger when files are created or updated in a specified Google Drive folder, allowing for automatic knowledge base updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## Integrations for Robust AI Workflows

[[ai_automation_with_n8n | n8n]] leverages various integrations to build scalable and production-ready AI applications:

### Superbase Integration

Superbase is utilized for both chat memory and as a vector database for RAG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Vector Database**: Superbase supports vectors for RAG via PG Vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. [[creating_powerful_ai_workflows_with_n8n | n8n]] provides SQL code to set up Superbase for RAG, including creating the PG Vector extension, a `documents` table (for content, metadata, and embeddings), and a matching function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Chat Memory (PostgreSQL)**: Superbase's PostgreSQL capabilities are used for scalable chat memory, preventing server overload that can occur with local memory solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. [[creating_powerful_ai_workflows_with_n8n | n8n]] can automatically create the necessary chat history table in Superbase if it doesn't exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Credential Setup**: Superbase requires a PostgreSQL connection string (host, database name, port, user, password) for chat memory and an API URL and Service Role Secret for vector database operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Google Drive Integration

[[creating_powerful_ai_workflows_with_n8n | n8n]] integrates with Google Drive to manage the RAG knowledge base:
*   **File Monitoring**: [[creating_powerful_ai_workflows_with_n8n | n8n]] can poll Google Drive for newly created or updated files in a specified folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Content Extraction**: It can download files, converting formats like Google Docs to text and Google Sheets to CSV, to extract raw text content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

### OpenAI Integration

*   **Chat Models**: [[creating_powerful_ai_workflows_with_n8n | n8n]] supports various chat models, including GPT (e.g., GPT-4 Omni) and Anthropic models, for the AI agent's core reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Embeddings**: OpenAI embeddings are used to convert document content into vector representations for the RAG knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

## Building RAG Workflows with n8n

A typical RAG workflow in [[using_n8n_for_api_workflows_in_ai_agents | n8n]] involves:
1.  **Chat Trigger**: Receiving a user query through the [[creating_powerful_ai_workflows_with_n8n | n8n]] chat widget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
2.  **AI Agent Node**: Processing the query using a defined AI agent, which includes a chat model (e.g., GPT), chat memory (e.g., Superbase PostgreSQL), and RAG tools (e.g., Superbase vector store) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
3.  **Document Retrieval**: The RAG tool queries the Superbase vector database to retrieve relevant documents based on the user's input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

For updating the knowledge base:
1.  **Google Drive Trigger**: Detecting new or updated files in a specific Google Drive folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
2.  **File ID Extraction**: Extracting the file ID for subsequent steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
3.  **Duplicate Handling**: Crucially, [[error_handling_and_workflow_scheduling_in_n8n | n8n]] workflows can delete old vectors associated with an updated file from the Superbase database *before* inserting new ones, preventing data duplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This ensures the knowledge base remains clean and accurate.
4.  **Content Download and Extraction**: Downloading the file and extracting its raw text content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
5.  **Vector Insertion**: Inserting the new document content and its embeddings into the Superbase vector database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
6.  **Chunking**: [[setting_up_local_ai_workflows_with_n8n | n8n]] can use a default document loader with a recursive character text splitter for chunking large documents into manageable sizes before embedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

Users can download pre-built [[creating_powerful_ai_workflows_with_n8n | n8n]] workflows (e.g., as JSON files) and easily import them into their own [[using_flowise_and_n8n_for_local_ai_automation | n8n]] instances, requiring only credential setup and minor customizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

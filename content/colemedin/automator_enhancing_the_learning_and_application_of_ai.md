From: [[colemedin]] <br/> 

Automator is a platform designed to provide a deeper, more organized, and community-driven approach to learning and applying AI, extending beyond the scope of traditional YouTube tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. It aims to teach users how to do "incredible things with AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>.

## Addressing the Depth Gap in AI Education

The creator's YouTube channel serves as a fantastic starting point for AI projects, offering concise tutorials on topics like [[improvements_to_ai_coding_assistants | Autod Dev]], Swarm, and the Local AI Starter Kit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. However, YouTube's format limits the ability to provide the in-depth knowledge required to build production-ready AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>. Automator seeks to bridge this gap by offering greater depth in several key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

### Community and Networking
The platform's Discourse Community, known as "Think Tank" (thinktank.automator.ai), provides an organized space for community interaction, troubleshooting, and discussion about [[improvements_to_ai_coding_assistants | Autod Dev]] and other AI-related interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. This forum aims to foster a more robust community than YouTube comment sections, allowing users to post questions and engage without being limited by weekly content topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

### Production-Ready Applications and Advanced Courses
Automator will host advanced courses focused on teaching users how to develop production-ready AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>. This content is designed for deeper dives into topics that may be introduced on the YouTube channel but require more extensive instruction for real-world implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>.

### Specific Use Cases for Generative AI
The platform will offer a vast resource library covering specific use cases for generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. This includes detailed guides on implementing AI solutions for various business problems, such as marketing or receptionist tasks, which are too specific for general YouTube content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:27]</a>.

### Staying Current with AI Tools
Automator will serve as a hub for the latest and greatest AI tools, ensuring that developers and business owners have access to up-to-date information for their AI implementation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

### Bridging Developers and Business Owners
A crucial aspect of Automator is its role in connecting developers with business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. Many business owners require AI implementation but struggle to find developers, and a significant portion of incoming emails reflect this need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>. Automator aims to facilitate these connections, benefiting both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## The [[building_ai_agents_for_automator_live_agent_studio | AI Agent Studio]]

A key feature of Automator is the [[building_ai_agents_for_automator_live_agent_studio | AI Agent Studio]], a dedicated space for users to test and learn how to implement various [[building_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:50">[02:05:50]</a>. Any [[building_ai_agents | AI agent]] showcased on the creator's YouTube channel will be uploaded here, allowing users to interact with them, delve deeper into their implementation, and collaborate with the community and other content creators to expand the library of agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:10">[02:11:10]</a>. The goal is for the Studio to become a comprehensive library of industry-leading [[building_ai_agents | AI agents]] and solutions, with open-source code available for learning and self-implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:27">[02:25:27]</a>.

## Value Proposition and Accessibility

While Automator operates as a business and will include opportunities for investment, its core philosophy is to provide immense value for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>. The aim is for users to perceive that they are receiving "way too much value for free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>. The creator is committed to making AI accessible and avoiding the impression of excessive monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>.

## Integration with [[improvements_to_ai_coding_assistants | Autod Dev]]

The Discourse Community for Automator is heavily focused on [[improvements_to_ai_coding_assistants | Autod Dev]] and serves as a vital component for its continued development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">[01:53:53]</a>. Furthermore, [[improvements_to_ai_coding_assistants | Autod Dev]] is intended to be hosted on the [[building_ai_agents_for_automator_live_agent_studio | AI Agent Studio]], enabling users to try it out without local installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:49">[02:48:49]</a>. This aligns with the long-term goal of an "extension marketplace" for [[improvements_to_ai_coding_assistants | Autod Dev]], allowing developers to contribute features without direct codebase modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:09">[03:39:09]</a>.

The [[crawl_for_ai_web_crawling_framework | Crawl for AI]] RAG [[mcp_servers_for_ai_coding | MCP server]] is described as a completely free and open-source solution built to provide up-to-date documentation for AI coding assistants like Windsurf and Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Functionality and Use
When an AI coder, such as Windinssurf, needs current documentation for tasks like building an AI agent with Pidantic AI, it can leverage the [[crawl_for_ai_web_crawling_framework | Crawl for AI]] [[mcp_servers_for_ai_coding | MCP server]] to obtain that information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This ensures that the AI assistant has access to the most recent knowledge required for its coding tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

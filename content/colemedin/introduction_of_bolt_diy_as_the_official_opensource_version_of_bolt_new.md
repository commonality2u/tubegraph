Over the past few months, the community has been developing oTToDev as a fork of Bolt.new, aiming to establish it as the premier open-source AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This effort has led to a significant strategic partnership that will transform the project's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Strategic Partnership with StackBlitz

Automator, the platform hosting the oTToDev community, has officially partnered with StackBlitz to establish oTToDev as the official open-source version of Bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. As part of this partnership, oTToDev will be renamed [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This collaboration is considered the "best case scenario" for both [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] and its community, solidifying its position as a leading open-source AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Vision for Bolt.DIY

The partnership aligns the visions of both parties, with the CEO of StackBlitz, Eric, and the Automator team discussing the future of [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

#### Eric's Vision: A Real-World Testing Ground
Eric emphasized the importance of [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] as a crucial tool for testing next-generation AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. He noted that when Bolt was initially open-sourced, there was a lack of good examples of production software utilizing AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] fills this gap by providing a real-world application for evaluating Frontier AI models, as existing benchmarks often don't represent practical scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The ability to swap out any LLM on the fly within [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] enables this essential evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

#### Automator's Vision: Education and Cutting-Edge Development
The Automator team envisions [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] as an educational platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. It aims to teach users how to effectively work with AI coding assistants, addressing the common issue of users getting poor results due to a lack of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Even with advanced features like full-stack application generation, users still need to learn to collaborate with the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Beyond education, [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] will serve as a fully-fledged product that users can run locally to work with local LLMs and experiment with advanced features not available in the commercial Bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This distinction allows [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] to move quickly as an open-source repository, pushing limits and building experimental features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

> "You can think of it like Bolt.new this is the stable product for you to go and very easily build anything but then if you want to experiment some really cool stuff push the limits build things yourself even and work with different llms that's when you go to Bolt.DIY" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>

## Key Aspects of the Transition

The transition to [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] involves several important points to ensure a smooth shift:

### Community Home
The Automator Think Tank will remain the home for the [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | Bolt.DIY community]], fostering a vibrant space for sharing ideas, collaborative work, and broad participation in the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Repository Relocation
The [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] repository will move to the StackBlitz Lab organization on GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Crucially, the repository itself will retain its existing stars, forks, commit history, pull requests, and issues, ensuring no loss of project momentum or record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Creative Freedom and Divergence
[[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] will maintain complete creative freedom in its implementation, community management, and roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This is possible because the commercial Bolt.new will diverge from [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]], allowing the open-source project to implement features without concern for their relevance to the commercial product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Despite this divergence, both projects will continue to share ideas, maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### Renaming Justification
While losing the "oTToDev" name, which had begun to establish a reputation, was challenging, the new name [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] (Do-It-Yourself) aligns perfectly with the project's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. It emphasizes the ability for users to run the project themselves, test with local LLMs, and incorporate cutting-edge features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Future Outlook

More [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | announcements for Bolt.DIY]] and Automator are expected soon, including partnerships with StackBlitz for events and the involvement of their open-source experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The official partnership between Automator and StackBlitz marks a new chapter for the project, promising an exciting future for [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt.DIY]] as a leading open-source AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

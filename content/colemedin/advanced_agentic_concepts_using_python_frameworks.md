Archon is an open-source AI agent designed to build other AI agents, leveraging advanced agentic techniques to produce better results than generalist AI coding assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It builds AI agents with pure code, ensuring flexibility and avoiding platform lock-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Archon is presented as the "world's first agenteer" or agent that builds other agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

It serves as an educational framework, teaching [[advanced_architecture_for_ai_agents | advanced agentic concepts]] using popular Python AI frameworks such as [[building_ai_agents_with_pydantic_ai | Pyantic AI]] and [[understanding_ai_agent_frameworks | Langraph]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## The AI Agent Army: A Demonstration of Advanced Concepts

A key demonstration of Archon's capabilities and [[developing_ai_agents_using_python | advanced AI agent development]] is the creation of an "AI agent army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This army consists of specialized sub-agents, each utilizing an MCP (Multi-Modal Compute Platform) server, allowing a primary agent to connect to various services easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Why Specialized Agents?
Specialized agents are crucial because Large Language Models (LLMs) can become overwhelmed quickly when given too many tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Every additional tool increases the prompt length to the LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. By distributing tools among specialized agents, prompt sizes are reduced, and LLMs are less likely to be overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The primary agent's role is to direct requests to the appropriate specialized sub-agent based on the required MCP server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. For example, a web search request would route to a Brave MCP server sub-agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Practical Application
The AI agent army can perform complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating various sub-agents. Examples include:
*   Listing GitHub repositories via a GitHub sub-agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   Searching the web for AI agent frameworks (using a Brave sub-agent) and then adding that information to an AirTable database (using an AirTable sub-agent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   Retrieving a URL from AirTable and sending it to a Slack channel (using AirTable and Slack sub-agents in tandem) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

This demonstrates how multiple specialized agents work in tandem to act like a personal assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Building the AI Agent Army with Archon

The entire code for the AI agent army was generated by Archon, requiring only a few iterations for refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### MCP Integration with [[building_ai_agents_with_pydantic_ai | Pyantic AI]]
The setup leverages a new [[creating_custom_ai_agent_frameworks_with_mcp | MCP]] integration within the [[building_ai_agents_with_pydantic_ai | Pyantic AI]] framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. [[building_ai_agents_with_pydantic_ai | Pyantic AI]]'s documentation, ingested by Archon, was instrumental in building this architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Server Configuration:** Defining MCP servers (e.g., Brave, AirTable, GitHub, Slack) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
2.  **Specialized Sub-Agents:** Creating an agent for each service, providing it with a model (like GPT-4 mini), a system prompt, and connecting it to a single MCP server for its tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
3.  **Primary Agent:** Giving the primary agent tools defined for each sub-agent it can call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. The primary agent uses docstrings to understand when and how to use each sub-agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

This setup offloads the burden of managing individual tools from the primary agent, allowing it to focus on routing requests to the correct specialized agent, thereby decreasing overall prompt sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

The AI agent army framework is extensible; users can add any MCP server by defining the server, creating a sub-agent, and then a corresponding tool for the primary agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Archon can assist in this process, using existing code as a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Archon's Architecture and Future Development

Archon is continually [[advancing_ai_agents_with_python_and_custom_coding | advancing AI agents]] and its own capabilities.
*   **Version 6:** Recently implemented, Archon now includes a tool library and [[creating_custom_ai_agent_frameworks_with_mcp | MCP integration]] with pre-built tools, examples, and MCP server configurations within an `agent_resources` folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
*   **The Advisor Agent:** A new agent within Archon's process, the "advisor," intelligently selects examples, pre-built tools, and MCP servers to feed into the primary coder agent based on user requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
*   **Robust Process:** Archon's process is becoming increasingly robust, allowing for the [[building_ai_agents_with_python | creation of agents]] that would be much more difficult with generalist AI IDEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

### Upcoming Features ([[frameworks_and_tools_for_ai_agent_development | Frameworks and tools for AI agent development]])
*   **[[understanding_ai_agent_frameworks | Langraph]] Documentation Integration:** Archon will soon be able to build agents using both [[building_ai_agents_with_pydantic_ai | Pyantic AI]] and [[understanding_ai_agent_frameworks | Langraph]] documentation, enabling the creation of more sophisticated AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
*   **Version 9 (Autonomous Refinement):** This version will allow Archon not just to build an agent but also to spin up an isolated environment, potentially create a database, run the agent, and autonomously refine it based on performance and errors, advancing the self-feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

Archon aims to be a powerful tool for [[building_ai_agents_from_scratch_with_python | building AI agents]] and learning [[advanced_architecture_for_ai_agents | advanced agentic systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

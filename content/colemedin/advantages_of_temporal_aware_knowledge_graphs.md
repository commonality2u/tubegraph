## Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Limitations

[[Using knowledge bases to enhance language models | Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]] is a fundamental component in most [[AI agents and tool integration for effective knowledge retrieval | AI agents]], providing them with external documents and data to build a knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, RAG alone has significant limitations, primarily its static nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It requires constant manual synchronization between the agent's knowledge base and the data store, a process that is often inefficient and unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This static characteristic means RAG struggles to keep up with constantly changing data, such as evolving user preferences, internal metrics, or market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Temporal Aware Knowledge Graphs: A Dynamic Solution

To address the limitations of static RAG, **temporal aware knowledge graphs** emerge as a powerful solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These are designed as a layer on top of RAG, specifically for continuously ingesting dynamic, ever-changing data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. A key feature is their ability to maintain a historical record of data changes, making the agent aware of how its knowledge base evolves over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This capability is particularly impactful for dynamic environments where data fluidity is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Graffiti: An Open-Source Implementation

[[introduction to Graffiti as a dynamic knowledge graph tool | Graffiti]] is an open-source platform exemplifying temporal aware knowledge graphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It serves as an engine for building and managing these dynamic knowledge graphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Key Advantages and Features

*   **Handling Dynamic Data**: Temporal aware knowledge graphs excel in environments where data changes frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Unlike static solutions, they are built for continuous incremental updates, capturing the evolution of information over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Historical Context**: These graphs not only update facts but also keep a historical record of how information has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
    *   **Example**: If a user's preference changes from Adidas to Puma shoes, a temporal aware knowledge graph records both the old preference and the new one, along with timestamps for when each was valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This historical context is crucial for personalized customer experiences or understanding past states of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Representing Relationships**: Information is stored in a graph structure (e.g., using Neo4j as the engine) where pieces of information are linked together by relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   This allows agents to understand how information in the knowledge base relates to each other and how these relationships change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   [[integrating_knowledge_graphs_with_vector_databases_for_ai_solutions | Knowledge graphs]] are generally more powerful than traditional RAG due to their ability to represent rich relationships and metadata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Intelligent Querying**:
    *   Agents can search the graph and receive results that include the fact, its insertion time (`valid_at`), and if applicable, its invalidation time (`invalid_at`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This enables the agent to reason about the relevance of information over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
    *   **Center Node Search**: Allows for more refined searches by focusing around a specific piece of information, preventing accidental retrieval of irrelevant facts (e.g., pulling GPT's token limit when querying about Claude) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Performance and Scalability (Graffiti Specific)**:
    *   Graffiti is designed to be lightweight and highly scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   It offers sub-second latency for both building the knowledge graph and querying, a significant improvement over more static knowledge graph solutions like Light RAG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   This performance makes it suitable for production environments to build robust RAG solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Flexible Data Ingestion**: Episodes (pieces of information) can be ingested without following a specific format, allowing for various content types like strings or JSON objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The LLM dynamically creates relationships based on its understanding of the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Local Hosting Options**: Tools like Graffiti leverage open-source knowledge graph engines like Neo4j, which can be hosted locally, and can integrate with local LLMs via Olama for a 100% local implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Knowledge Graphs

While other knowledge graph implementations like Graph RAG and Light RAG exist, they are often designed for more static document summarization, such as unchanging documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Temporal aware knowledge graphs like Graffiti, however, are specifically tailored for dynamic data, which is more common in real-world business and platform use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Integrating Temporal Aware Knowledge Graphs with AI Agents

The ideal [[Integrating Knowledge Bases with AI | RAG solution]] for [[AI agents and tool integration for effective knowledge retrieval | AI agents]] often involves combining different strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. [[AI agents and tool integration for effective knowledge retrieval | Agentic RAG]], for example, empowers an agent to explore knowledge in diverse ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

*   An agent can be equipped with a tool to search a knowledge graph (like Graffiti) and another tool to perform a traditional lookup in a [[managing_embeddings_and_vectors_in_a_knowledge_base | vector database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
*   This combination is highly powerful because information can be better represented in one format over another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. The agent can then reason about which tool to use, leading to more accurate and comprehensive answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

By providing [[AI agents and tool integration for effective knowledge retrieval | AI agents]] with temporal aware knowledge graphs, such as those built with Graffiti, along with other [[Using knowledge graphs with RAG agents | RAG strategies]], developers can create robust and adaptive AI systems that truly understand and leverage evolving information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

Complex problems are better solved by a team of people with different specializations, and the same principle applies to [[Defining AI agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Combining individual expertise from [[Specialized AI agents vs generalist AI coders | specialized AI agents]] creates exponentially better solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Advantages of Specialized AI Agents

Just like humans, [[Defining AI agents | AI agents]] perform better when their role and goals are narrowly defined, emphasizing focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. When a single [[Defining AI agents | AI agent]] is given too many instructions and tools, it can start to hallucinate, even on tasks it previously performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Large Language Models (LLMs) can quickly become overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A key solution to this issue, and a way to elevate [[AI agents and their development | AI agents]] to the next level, is to fragment them into different sub-agents, each handling distinct components of a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Parallel Agent Architecture

Creating an "army" of [[Specialized AI agents vs generalist AI coders | specialized agents]] requires careful consideration of how to split the problem, what tools each agent needs, and how to combine their work efficiently at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Since a single LLM can take time to respond, managing many specialized agents running concurrently is crucial to avoid system delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The **Parallel Agent Architecture** is one of the most important [[Advanced architecture for AI agents | agent architectures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This architecture involves a group of specialized agents running simultaneously to achieve a common goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The core of this architecture, as explained by AnthropIC, involves:
*   **Input:** User input is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Individual AI Agents:** This input is fed into several [[Defining AI agents | AI agents]], each with its own instructions and tools to tackle a specific part of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Aggregator:** A non-LLM aggregator at the end takes the parallel outputs from each agent and produces a combined, nicely formatted output for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

An enhancement to this architecture involves using another [[Defining AI agents | AI agent]] as a synthesizer to aggregate the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This synthesizer agent is responsible for summarizing, formatting, or performing other operations on the outputs from the parallel agents to create the final user output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This synthesizer can also act as a validator for outputs from other agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

### Building Parallel Agent Architectures

[[Building AI Agents | Building AI agents]] for parallel architectures often involves frameworks like Pydantic AI and LangGraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

#### Pydantic AI for Individual Agents

When [[Building AI Agents | building Pydantic AI agents]], there are three distinct parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>:
1.  **Defining Dependencies:** These include API keys, database connections, and other information required by the agent's tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. For a flight agent, this might include preferred airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
2.  **Agent Definition:** This is where you specify the Large Language Model (LLM) to use, the system prompt, and other parameters like automatic retries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The system prompt provides instructions for the agent's role, goals, and how to use its tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
3.  **Defining Tools:** Tools encapsulate specific functionalities within a function that the agent can call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. A docstring above the function specifies to the agent when and how to use the tool, including its purpose and arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Tools are essentially functions wrapped and sent as part of the prompt to the LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

**Example: Travel Planner Assistant**
A travel planner assistant agent serves as a good example of how specialized sub-agents can handle different components of a trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The architecture for this assistant includes:
*   **Info Gathering Agent:** This agent collects necessary information from the user (e.g., destination, origin, dates, budget) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. It uses structured outputs to guarantee key information is present and gates the rest of the process until all details are collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Flight Agent:** Recommends flights based on user preferences and collected travel details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Hotel Agent:** Recommends hotels based on user preferences (e.g., amenities, budget) and collected travel details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Activity Agent:** Recommends activities, potentially considering factors like weather data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Synthesizer Agent:** Combines recommendations from the parallel agents into a comprehensive travel plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

These specialized agents can operate in isolation or as part of a larger architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

#### LangGraph for Workflow Orchestration

LangGraph implementations consist of three distinct parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>:
1.  **Graph State:** Defines the key pieces of information to track throughout the workflow execution, such as conversation history, travel details, user preferences, and results from agent executions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
2.  **Nodes:** Define all the logic for the graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. A node can invoke an [[Defining AI agents | AI agent]] or contain deterministic code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. For instance, the "Gathering Info" node handles the conversation with the info-gathering agent, building message history and processing structured responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
3.  **Graph Setup:** Combines the state and nodes within a graph instance and connects them with edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

**Implementing Parallel Execution:**
LangGraph allows for conditional edges to control the flow, such as deciding whether to continue gathering information or proceed to specialized agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. To achieve simultaneous execution, a router function can return a list of nodes that should be executed in parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. For example, once all travel details are gathered, the flight, hotel, and activity recommendation nodes can be executed concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

**Human-in-the-Loop:** LangGraph supports "interrupts" to add human interaction, allowing the workflow to pause and wait for user input, such as providing additional travel details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

This architecture is not just efficient due to simultaneous processing; it is transformative, allowing for the solution of complex problems across various use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. It unlocks a new level of power in [[Building fullscale AI agents | building agentic systems]] that surpasses what a single [[Defining AI agents | AI agent]] can achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.

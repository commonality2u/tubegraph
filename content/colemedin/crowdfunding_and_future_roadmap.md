## Introduction to Autod Dev's Future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

Autod Dev is an open-source AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> that recently launched its community in the Automator Think Tank, leading to a significant increase in project engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The core team of maintainers and community members are actively making additions to the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The project is focused on having a strong vision to ensure its continued progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Autod Dev Roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>

An initial roadmap for Autod Dev has been shared, built using Road map.sh, a platform designed for creating roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This roadmap is currently a rough draft, as the community is still in the planning phase for the project's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. It will be updated frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

The goal is to maintain a clear vision for Autod Dev to prevent it from implementing random features without direction and ultimately failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Current and High-Priority Features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>

The roadmap includes features that have already been implemented and a set of high-priority features currently visible in the Autod Dev repository's README <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

High-priority features include:
*   **Preventing Bolt from rewriting many files** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>
*   **Better prompting for smaller Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Currently, models like a 3 billion parameter one cannot even open the web container, and performance for other LLMs is not as good as Sonnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Different prompts that work better for various LLMs, especially local ones, are crucial for improved performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Loading local projects**: This is a highly requested feature and is currently being worked on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Attaching images to prompts**: For models that support this functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Running agents in the backend**: This could involve a Chain-of-Thought system with a mixture of agents to generate better code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Next Big Steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>

Following the current set of high-priority features, one of the next major goals is **one-click deploy to Netlify**, similar to the commercial Bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Extension Marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>

A significant future development is an **extension marketplace** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This marketplace would allow developers to create plugins for Autod Dev without needing to update the main repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Users could then toggle these extensions on and off in their UI, preventing feature bloat as Autod Dev grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This approach aims to keep the UI clean while continuously adding new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Crowdfunding Efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>

Community members have expressed interest in donating to the project to fund the implementation of new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

One option being considered is starting a Kickstarter campaign, as it is a well-regarded crowdfunding platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

Additionally, the project is exploring potential strategic partnerships that could provide funding, though these are still in early stages and cannot be publicly discussed yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Updates on crowdfunding options are expected within the next couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The goal of crowdfunding is to enable bounties on features to accelerate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

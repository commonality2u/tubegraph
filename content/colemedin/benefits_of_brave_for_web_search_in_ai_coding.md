Using web search capabilities can significantly enhance the performance of [[using_ai_coding_assistance | AI coding assistants]] like Windinssurf and Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Brave is one such tool utilized for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Role of Brave in AI Coding Environments

When an [[effective_use_of_ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistant]] is tasked with building an AI agent, it requires up-to-date documentation and potentially other resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. While tools like the [[crawl_for_ai_web_crawling_framework | crawl for AI]] RAG MCP server provide documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, Brave supplements this by enabling the AI to search for additional resources as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This integration allows for a seamless workflow where the [[effective_use_of_ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistant]] can autonomously acquire necessary information during the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The ability to perform [[web_search_agent_development_with_brave_api | web search]] for supplementary information is crucial for the [[effective_use_of_ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistant]] to generate comprehensive and functional code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

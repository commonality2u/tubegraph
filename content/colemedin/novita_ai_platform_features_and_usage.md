Novita AI is an all-encompassing AI Cloud platform designed to simplify the process of getting started with open-source large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The platform offers a range of features for deploying and managing AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## Primary Products

Novita AI provides three main product offerings:

1.  **LLM API**
    *   Offers easy access to a variety of large language models through a simple API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   Includes standard models like Llama 3.1 405b, as well as unique models suitable for creative writing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
    *   Features competitive pricing for its models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    *   Is OpenAI compatible, allowing users to override the base URL to use Novita AI in applications as if they were interacting with GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

2.  **Serverless**
    *   Enables easy deployment of AI applications without the need for infrastructure management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

3.  **GPU Instances**
    *   Highly configurable, allowing users to select instance types and choose the number of GPUs, up to eight per instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   Supports various templates, including [[Ollama with Open Web UI | Ollama]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    *   Users can create custom templates using any container image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
    *   It is possible to use a custom fork like `bolt.new` (an [[building_applications_with_ai_assistance | Autod Dev]] fork) directly in a Novita AI instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   Setting up an instance with Ollama and Open Web UI with two 3090 GPUs takes only minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   Instances provide a terminal for in-browser interaction and offer blazing-fast performance, exemplified by running Code Llama 13B to create a Snake game in Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

From: [[colemedin]] <br/> 

The project initially known as "bolt.new any LLM", which started as a fork of [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | bolt.new]], has been renamed to **autod Dev** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This change comes only three weeks after its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Reasons for the Renaming

The decision to rename the project was made to establish its distinct identity, even though a potential merger into the main [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | bolt.new]] repository is considered for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The project has evolved to do "a lot of really cool things" that necessitate its own separate identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Additionally, "autod Dev" was chosen as a "sweet name" that aligns with other developments happening behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Project Growth and Community Engagement

Initially, the fork was created to assist users in leveraging various [[opensource_reasoning_llms | LLMs]], including [[using_local_large_language_models_with_autod_dev | local ones]] with Ollama, within [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | bolt.new]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. However, in recent weeks, a substantial community has formed around the project, leading to significant advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. The rapid growth has made it challenging to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

The project aims to create the best [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | open-source AI coding assistant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

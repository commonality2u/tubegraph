[[Defining AI agents | AI agents]] are systems that leverage large language models (LLMs) to reason and take actions on behalf of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These capabilities allow for a wide range of practical applications.

## General Capabilities of AI Agents

An [[Defining AI agents | AI agent]] can perform various actions, including:
*   Summarizing Slack conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Sending emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Writing or executing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Interacting with GitHub repositories, such as looking at and analyzing individual files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Specific Real-world Applications

Various guides highlight real-world use cases that can provide "quick wins" for businesses or personal automations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. These include:

### Customer Service
[[Specialized AI Agents | AI agents]] can be used for classifying and responding to customer queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### General Business Operations
Agents can streamline business processes such as:
*   Approving refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   Reviewing documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   Automatically organizing files in platforms like SharePoint, Outlook, or Gmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

### Research Tasks
LLMs are highly effective for general research tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

### Development Tools
[[Specialized AI Agents | AI agents]] can serve as powerful development tools, such as AI coding assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. An example is Augment Code, which is a coding agent designed to understand large codebases, providing a solution for complex projects where other AI coding assistants might fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. It can index a codebase to turn it into a knowledge base for the AI assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, allowing it to deeply understand the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Scheduling Tasks
[[Specialized AI Agents | AI agents]] are useful for general scheduling and administrative tasks, including:
*   Managing calendars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   Planning invites and sending meeting requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   Managing inboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   Managing tasks within project management software like ClickUp or Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

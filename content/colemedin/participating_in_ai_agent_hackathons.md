The Live Agent Studio hosts an AI agent hackathon, offering a chance to [[building_ai_agents | build and showcase open-source AI agents]] to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This event celebrates the introduction of Agent Zero, a new tool within the platform designed to simplify the process of hooking locally-run AI agents into a front end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## [[ai_hackathon_competition_details | Competition Details]]
The hackathon encourages participants to [[building_ai_agents | build AI agents]] that are compatible with the Live Agent Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Eligibility and Agent Compatibility
To compete, participants must [[building_ai_agents | build an agent]] that can be hosted as an API endpoint within a Docker container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This allows for a wide range of technologies, including:
*   Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
*   n8n <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
*   Voiceflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
*   Flowise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>

### [[timeline_and_registration_process_for_ai_hackathon | Timeline and Registration]]
The hackathon runs from the 8th to the 22nd of the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. A community voting period is also included, allowing participants to contribute to selecting the winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Registration links are provided in the video description and pinned comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### [[prize_breakdown_for_ai_hackathon | Prizes and Sponsorship]]
The hackathon boasts a total prize pool of $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Sponsors include Voiceflow, n8n, and OpenRouter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Students who register will receive free credits for OpenRouter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Multiple prizes are available, meaning participants don't need to secure first place to win something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Submission Process
To submit an agent and compete, participants need to:
1.  [[building_ai_agents | Build an agent]] compatible with the Live Agent Studio by following the comprehensive developer guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
2.  Submit the agent via a dedicated form on the Live Agent Studio platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
Once submitted, the agent will be hosted on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Benefits of Participation
The hackathon offers an excellent opportunity to:
*   Showcase AI mastery to a global audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Win cash prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   Gain experience [[building_ai_agents | AI agents]] that are production-ready and can be deployed as API endpoints with front ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   Learn best practices for [[building_ai_agents | AI agents]] in a real-world context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Utilize Agent Zero for free, enabling instant front-end integration for locally hosted agents without complex setup or third-party hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Agent Zero
Agent Zero is a new tool within the Live Agent Studio designed to facilitate the rapid development and testing of [[building_ai_agents | AI agents]] with a full front-end interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It allows users to:
*   Build and run [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Instantly connect agents to a front end for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Avoid complicated setups or third-party hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   Host Superbase locally for a 100% local development environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   Streamline the process compared to other frameworks like Open Web UI for custom agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Using Agent Zero requires providing four pieces of information: Superbase project URL, Superbase public key, agent API endpoint, and an optional bearer token for authorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. A dedicated guide is available for setting up Agent Zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

The API endpoint created for the Live Agent Studio is versatile and can also be used for custom front ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The Live Agent Studio aims to provide a guide for [[building_ai_agents | building AI agents]] into real-world, production-ready solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

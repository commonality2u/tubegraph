When [[running_supabase_locally_with_docker | running Supabase locally]] as part of a local AI package, configuring environment variables is a crucial step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Most of the environment variables in the provided `.env.example` file originate from Supabase, allowing for extensive configuration options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, for a foundational setup, only a few of these variables need to be explicitly set, with most others retaining their default values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Initial Setup of the .env File

To begin, you will create a new `.env` file and copy all content from the `.env.example` file into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Essential Environment Variables

### n8n Credentials

The first variables to configure are for [[integrating_n8n_and_supabase | n8n]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>:
*   `N8N_JWT_SECRET`
*   `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

These can be set to any random alphanumeric string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Supabase Database Credentials

Next, define the database credentials for your local Supabase instance:
*   `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: This is the password for your PostgreSQL database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. You define this yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   `DASHBOARD_USERNAME`: The username for accessing the local Supabase dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`: The password for the local Supabase dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   `PGBOUNCER_TENANT_ID`: Set this to any numerical value; it's used for transaction Pooler connections to the Supabase database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

Other related values for the dashboard login can typically be left as their default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Supabase API Keys

The final three environment variables are generated using a tool provided in the [[selfhosting_supabase_with_docker | Supabase self-hosting with Docker guide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>:
1.  **`SUPABASE_AUTH_JWT_SECRET`**: This JWT secret can be automatically generated by refreshing the Supabase documentation page linked in the `README` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
2.  **`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`**: On the documentation page, click on "Anonymous key" and then "generate JWT" to obtain this value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
3.  **`SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`**: Select "Service key" from the dropdown and click "generate JWT" to get this key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

These keys are typically generated for remote Supabase instances but must be manually defined when [[running_supabase_locally_with_docker | running Supabase locally]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Advanced Configuration

For more complex [[selfhosting_supabase_with_docker | Supabase self-hosting]] features, such as email authentication or dashboard authentication, additional environment variables and setup are required. Refer to the comprehensive [[selfhosting_supabase_with_docker | Supabase guide for self-hosting with Docker]] for advanced configurations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Once these environment variables are configured, you are ready to spin up your [[building_a_local_ai_package_with_supabase | local AI package]] using Docker Compose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

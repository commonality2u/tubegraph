The Automator platform is hosting an [[participating_in_ai_agent_hackathons | AI agent hackathon]] competition, offering $5,000 in cash prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. To participate, individuals must build an AI agent for the Automator Live Agent Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Goal and Purpose
The hackathon aims to involve the community with the Live Agent Studio in an exciting way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It serves as a challenge to build an incredible AI agent that solves a real-world problem, win money, and showcase AI mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The goal is to make it the most straightforward and fun competition for participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The Live Agent Studio itself is described as a community-driven platform filled with cutting-edge, open-source agents that users can try, download, and learn from for personal or business implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## What to Build
Participants need to build an AI Agent following the developer guide, which includes links and resources available during the registration period, such as an in-depth guide and templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Supported Platforms
Agents can be built using:
*   Any AI agent within a Docker container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   Any Python agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Anything built with N/N Flowise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>

[[ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistants]] are becoming an indispensable tool in software development, with the future of creating software involving humans working alongside AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Not utilizing AI to aid in coding applications and automations risks falling behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. For instance, Anthropic, the company behind Claude, reports that 70% of their company's code is now written by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Types of AI Coding Assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>
[[ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistants]] come in different forms:
*   **AI IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)**: These operate directly on your computer within your development environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Examples include Windsurf, Cursor, and Rue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Front-end Specific Builders**: These run in your browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Examples include Lovable, bolt.diy, and bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## Effective Use of AI Coding Assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>

### Prompting AI Coding Assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
Learning how to prompt [[ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistants]] effectively is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. While it relates to [[effective_prompting | effective prompting]] in general, there are specific techniques to learn for working with these assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This includes setting up global rules to dictate their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Leveraging MCP Servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
Utilizing MCP (Multi-Capability Platform) servers can provide [[ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistants]] with extra tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This allows them to perform actions such as managing databases or searching the web for up-to-date documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### Capabilities Over Tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
When using [[ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistants]] or any AI tool, prioritize learning the high-level skills that transfer across different tools, rather than spending excessive time mastering very specific tools that might quickly become irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Focus on what you can accomplish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Learning by Doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>
To gain comfort and proficiency, it is highly recommended to build simple automations and agents using code with the help of [[ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Download and experiment with AI IDEs like Windsurf, Cursor, or Rue Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Integration in AI Agent Development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>
[[ai_coding_assistants | AI coding assistants]] are beneficial even when learning to build [[ai_coding_agents | AI agents]] with code, particularly for individuals with limited coding experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. They can assist in the coding process, though it's important to understand the code being generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

Managing databases with natural language is a significant advancement for AI coding assistants, making tasks like creating projects, SQL tables, and managing records more intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This capability is crucial for [[database_setup_and_management_for_ai_agents | database setup and management]] when working with AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## What is Neon?

Neon is a serverless [[using_postgres_and_superbase_for_ai_chat_memory | Postgres]] platform that functions as an MCP (Multi-Cloud Platform) server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It enables users to manage their database using natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Capabilities

With Neon, AI coding assistants can:
*   Create new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   Create SQL tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Manage database records, all through natural language commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

This functionality streamlines the process of building applications, such as a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) AI agent, where Neon can seamlessly create necessary tables for the agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Integration with AI Coding Assistants

For AI coders like Windsurf and Cursor, having an MCP server for [[open_source_ai_tools_for_database_management | database management]] via natural language, such as Neon, is considered a "game-changer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

For example, when building an AI agent, the AI coder can instruct Neon to:
*   Create a new project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Set up the required tables for the AI agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

This seamless integration allows the AI agent to receive its complete code efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

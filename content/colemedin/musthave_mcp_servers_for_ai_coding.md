For those utilizing AI coders such as Windsurf and Cursor, integrating specific [[MCP servers for AI coding | MCP servers]] is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These servers enhance the capabilities of AI coding assistants, making the development process more seamless and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Essential [[MCP servers for AI coding | MCP Server]] Types

Three primary types of [[MCP servers for AI coding | MCP servers]] are identified as crucial for AI coding workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>:

### 1. Up-to-Date Documentation Server

This server type is vital for providing current documentation to your AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. An example is the completely free and [[opensource_crawl_for_ai_rag_mcp_server | open-source crawl for AI rag MCP server]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. When developing an AI agent, this server can be leveraged to retrieve necessary documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### 2. Web Search Server

A web search server complements the documentation server by allowing the AI assistant to search for additional resources online if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Brave is cited as an example of a web search tool used in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### 3. Natural Language Database Management Server

A significant advancement for AI coding is an [[managing_databases_with_mcp_servers | MCP server]] that enables database management using natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Neon, a serverless Postgres platform, serves as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This server allows the AI to create projects and SQL tables, and manage records using natural language commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Practical Application

These [[building_and_using_mcp_servers | MCP servers]] integrate seamlessly into the AI coding workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. For instance, when using Windsurf to build an AI agent with Pidantic AI:

*   The AI will utilize the [[opensource_crawl_for_ai_rag_mcp_server | crawl for AAI MCP server]] to access up-to-date documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   It can use a web search tool like Brave to look for additional resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   The Neon [[managing_databases_with_mcp_servers | MCP server]] is used to create new projects and necessary database tables for the AI agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

This integrated approach allows the AI to generate complete code for an agent, build user interfaces, and leverage knowledge bases effectively, significantly streamlining the development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

[[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] is an [[archon_as_an_opensource_ai_agent_builder | open-source AI agent]] designed to [[Building AI Agents | build other AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It is described as the "world's first agenteer" due to its ability to create AI agents using pure code, freeing users from specific platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] leverages [[advanced_architecture_for_ai_agents | advanced agentic techniques]] to produce better results than generalist AI coding assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The developer has been working on [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] for several months, aiming to make it an effective [[Archon AI agent builder | AI agent builder]] for learning and use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The AI Agent Army: An [[Archon AI agent builder | Archon]] Creation

One significant creation using [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] is an "AI agent army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This army consists of specialized sub-agents, each leveraging an MCP (Microservice Communication Protocol) server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This setup allows a primary agent to easily connect to various services, laying the groundwork for an "ultimate personal assistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The impressive aspect is that the entire army was built by [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] itself, without manual coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Why Specialized Agents?

The decision to use specialized agents rather than giving all MCP tools to a single agent stems from the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. LLMs can quickly become overwhelmed if given too many tools, as each tool increases the prompt length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. By splitting the burden among different specialized agents, prompts remain smaller, reducing the chance of LLM overwhelm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. A primary agent then handles dispatching requests to the appropriate specialized sub-agent based on the required MCP server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This means the primary agent only needs to choose from a few agents rather than many individual tools, simplifying its decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Demonstration of the Agent Army

The AI agent army showcases its capabilities through various tasks:

*   **GitHub Integration:** The primary agent can route requests to a GitHub sub-agent to list repositories for a specified username <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Web Search and Data Entry:** A complex request to search the web for "top AI agent frameworks" using the Brave MCP server and then add the findings, along with sources, into a frameworks table in an AI research base using the AirTable sub-agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Multi-Agent Workflow:** Continuing the conversation, the agent can retrieve the exact URL for the AirTable base and send a link to a Slack channel using the AirTable and Slack sub-agents in tandem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This demonstrates the seamless integration of different specialized agents working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## [[Development and setup of the Archon AI agent | Building the AI Agent Army with Archon]]

The entire codebase for the AI agent army was generated by [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The developer iterated a few times, a common practice with AI coding assistants, but the core functionality was achieved without manual coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The setup utilizes the new MCP integration feature of Pyantic AI, a preferred AI agent framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] ingested Pyantic AI's documentation to understand how to implement this integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Setting up MCP Servers:** Configuring various MCP servers like Brave, AirTable, file system access, GitHub, Slack, and Firecrawl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
2.  **Creating Sub-Agents:** An agent is created for each MCP server (e.g., AirTable agent, GitHub agent), given a model (even GPT-4 mini was effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>), a system prompt, and a list of MCP servers it needs to connect to for its tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Each sub-agent is specialized for a single MCP server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
3.  **Defining the Primary Agent:** The primary agent is given a model and a system prompt. It has a tool defined for each sub-agent it can call into, using a docstring to understand when and how to use each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

This setup provides a template for building a personal assistant that can connect to any MCP server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Users can easily extend this by defining a server, a sub-agent, and a tool for the primary agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] can assist in this process, taking existing code as a starting point and adding new MCP servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

The initial prompt used to kick off the [[Archons AI agent building process | AI agent building process]] with [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] is available in its GitHub repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. While it didn't "one-shot" the entire setup perfectly, it provided an impressive starting point, correctly setting up MCP servers and primary agent dependencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## [[Archons AI agent building process | Archon's Architecture]] and [[Archon as an opensource AI agent builder | Open-Source Nature]]

[[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] is a free and [[archon_as_an_opensource_ai_agent_builder | open-source tool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The development follows a "build in public" approach, where iterations are shared, allowing users to follow the journey and even contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. It also serves as an [[educational_framework_utilizing_archon_for_ai_development | educational framework]], teaching advanced agentic concepts using Python AI frameworks like Pyantic AI and Langraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

[[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] recently implemented version six, which includes a tool library and an MCP integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This means [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] now has pre-built tools, examples, and MCP servers within its agent resources folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

A new "advisor" agent has been added to [[Archons AI agent building process | Archon's process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This agent intelligently selects examples, pre-built tools, and MCP servers based on the user's request, feeding them to the primary coder agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This robust multi-agent process within [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] allows for building complex agents that would be much harder with generalist AI IDEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

## [[Future Plans for Archon and AI Agent Development | Future Plans for Archon]]

[[Future Plans for Archon and AI Agent Development | Future plans for Archon]] include:
*   **Langraph Integration:** Incorporating Langraph documentation alongside Pyantic AI, enabling [[Building AI Agents | Archon]] to build even more sophisticated AI agents with both frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   **Autonomous Agent Refinement (Version 9):** A major upcoming feature where [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] will not only build agents but also spin up isolated environments, create databases, run the agents, check for errors and good results, and then autonomously refine them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This will significantly advance the self-feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

[[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] is envisioned as a tool for [[Building AI Agents | building agents]] and an [[educational_framework_utilizing_archon_for_ai_development | educational framework]] for learning [[advanced_architecture_for_ai_agents | advanced agentic systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

The GitHub repository for [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] is available for users to explore and contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Instructions for installation and usage are provided in its readme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. An exclusive community called dynamis.ai is also being started, offering workshops on how various agents built with [[Introduction to Archon | Archon]] were created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

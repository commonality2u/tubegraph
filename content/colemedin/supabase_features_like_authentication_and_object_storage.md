[[supabase_as_an_opensource_platform | Supabase]] is an [[supabase_as_an_opensource_platform | incredible open-source platform]] that serves as a popular database for [[using_supabase_for_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Built on PostgreSQL, it offers a robust backend for various AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Core Capabilities for AI Projects

Supabase provides a comprehensive suite of features that make it an ideal choice for AI development:

*   **Conversation History and State Management**: It can be used to manage the conversation history and state for AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Vector Database Functionality**: With the PG Vector extension, Supabase can be transformed into a [[using_supabase_as_a_vector_database | vector database for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This makes it a [[using_supabase_for_ai_agents | perfect platform for AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Authentication**: Supabase includes [[superbase_authentication_integration_in_ai_apps | authentication]] features right out of the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Object Storage**: It also offers object storage capabilities, which are available immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

These features collectively suggest that no matter what kind of application you are [[superbase_integration_for_ai_projects | building with AI, there is a place for Supabase]] due to its utility and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Self-Hosting and Local Integration

As Supabase is [[supabase_as_an_opensource_platform | entirely open source]], it provides instructions for [[selfhosting_supabase_with_docker | self-hosting it with Docker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This makes it relatively easy to integrate Supabase into local AI services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. While integrating Supabase might be slightly more complex than other platforms, the process can be walked through step-by-step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Users familiar with Supabase will find its local setup very familiar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

For instance, it's possible to build a [[using_supabase_as_a_vector_database_for_ai_agents | RAG AI agent]] in [[integrating_n8n_and_supabase | n8n]] that runs entirely locally using a Supabase instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

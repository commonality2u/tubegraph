Navigating the landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an AI developer presents several challenges, particularly when working with multiple platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. While specialized tools like Bolt.new and Fragment are useful for generating codebases, and Cursor and Klein excel at creating functions or components, there's often a need for a [[overview_of_the_chat_llm_platform | Chat LLM]]-like interface to get advice on specific project problems or help with higher-level details that AI coding assistants cannot address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Key Challenges

### Fragmented Ecosystem and High Costs
A primary issue is the fragmentation of LLMs across different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This necessitates paying separate monthly fees for each service, such as $20 per month for [[overview_of_the_chat_llm_platform | GPT]] and another $20 per month for [[overview_of_the_chat_llm_platform | Claude]], in addition to accessing platforms for [[using_llama_for_llms | Llama]] and [[overview_of_the_chat_llm_platform | Gemini]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This cumulative cost can become substantial.

### Frustration with Model Limitations
Developers often encounter situations where even the best LLMs fall short for a particular problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This leads to the need to switch between different LLMs, hoping another model might be better suited to handle the specific task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This constant switching can be a source of frustration.

### Rate Limits
Another significant hurdle when using individual LLM platforms is frequently hitting "nasty rate limits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These limits restrict the number of requests a user can make within a given timeframe, interrupting workflow and hindering productivity.

These challenges highlight the need for a unified platform that offers access to multiple LLMs at an affordable price, without the constant worry of rate limits or the inconvenience of switching between different services.

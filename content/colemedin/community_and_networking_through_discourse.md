The **AutodDev** project, a new fork of Bolt.new, has officially launched a Discourse community called "Think Tank" to foster [[community_engagement_and_contributions | community]] and networking among its users and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. This platform aims to provide a structured and professional environment for collaboration on **AutodDev** and broader AI-related topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:56">[01:55:56]</a>.

## Launch and Access

The Discourse community is now officially live and accessible at [thinktank.automator.ai](https://thinktank.automator.ai) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Users can create a free account to gain immediate access to the entire forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Purpose and Vision
The primary goal of establishing this Discourse community is to cultivate a more personal and organized space for the [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | AutodDev community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:47">[01:46:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. It serves as an extension of the broader "Automator" initiative, designed to provide deeper engagement and resources beyond what a YouTube channel can offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.

The platform aims to:
*   **Foster deeper community**: Moving beyond YouTube comments and GitHub issues for more organized discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Enable networking**: Provide a dedicated space for users to connect and collaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:37">[01:34:37]</a>.
*   **Support [[community_contributions_to_software_development | community contributions]]**: Facilitate discussions around implementing new features, managing pull requests, and troubleshooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Connect developers and business owners**: Address the significant demand for AI implementation by fostering connections between those who can build and those who need solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:22">[01:16:22]</a>.

## Why Discourse?

The choice of Discourse over platforms like Discord or Slack was deliberate, emphasizing professionalism and organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Key advantages of Discourse include:
*   **Professional Feel**: Offers a more professional environment compared to the "silly sound effects" and "holiday updates" sometimes found on Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Official Plugin Support**: Provides robust support for plugins, including AI [[integration_with_various_platforms | integration]] for summarizing conversations, reducing reliance on third-party bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Superior Organization**: Excels in organizing discussions with sub-categories and categories, crucial for managing a growing open-source project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Excellent Search Functionality**: Facilitates easy retrieval of past posts, which is vital for troubleshooting, managing pull requests, and developing new features in **AutodDev** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **White-labeling**: Allows the platform to appear as an integral part of the main website, a strategy used by major companies like OpenAI and Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Community Engagement and Contributions

The Discourse platform is designed to be the central hub for all **AutodDev**-related discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. It will serve as a place for:
*   **General discussions**: Users can post any questions or topics related to AI development, not just those tied to specific video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.
*   **Troubleshooting**: A dedicated "issues and troubleshooting" category will allow users to ask for help, with **AutodDev** team members providing support for installation and operational issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>.
*   **Developer collaboration**: Developers are encouraged to sign up to chat with others about features to implement and contribute via pull requests on GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:42">[02:41:42]</a>. The project is open to any feature implementation, provided it aligns with the project's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:25">[02:16:25]</a>.
*   **[[Community engagement in open source projects | Open source collaboration]]**: The speaker emphasizes the project's commitment to being open and accessible, with nearly all developed code being public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:53">[02:39:53]</a>.

### Engagement Incentives
To encourage early [[prerelease_and_community_collaboration | engagement]], a giveaway is being held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Individuals who create an account and make a non-spam post on the Discourse community by Tuesday, November 12th, will be entered to win a $200 Amazon gift card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Integration with Automator and Future Roadmaps

The Discourse community is a subdomain of "Automator.ai" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, a larger platform dedicated to teaching and providing resources for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The Discourse community will serve as a key component of Automator, providing the depth in [[community_engagement_in_open_source_projects | community]] and networking that a YouTube channel cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>.

Future plans include:
*   **Roadmap Management**: Utilizing tools like Roadmaps.sh to create detailed, community-driven roadmaps for **AutodDev** features, including short-term and long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:02">[03:34:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:07">[03:57:07]</a>.
*   **Developer Team Expansion**: Actively forming a team of maintainers to manage the growing demand and workload for **AutodDev**, leveraging their expertise to accelerate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:02">[02:06:02]</a>.
*   **Crowdfunding for Features**: Exploring crowdfunding initiatives to incentivize developers to tackle high-priority features that require significant time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:08">[04:55:08]</a>.
*   **Extension Marketplace**: Exploring an "extension marketplace" within Automator where developers can upload **AutodDev** extensions without directly modifying the core codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

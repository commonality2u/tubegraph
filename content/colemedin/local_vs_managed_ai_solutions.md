The choice between local self-hosted and managed services for AI solutions is a frequently debated topic among developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This decision significantly impacts an application's [[Tech Stack for Managed AI Services | tech stack]] and overall direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Making an informed decision is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## [[Tech Stack for Managed AI Services | AI Tech Stacks]]

Understanding the technologies involved in both approaches can help paint a clear picture of what you would be using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The following are suggested [[Tech Stack for Managed AI Services | tech stacks]] that work for most use cases, though many other options exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Local [[Tech Stack for Managed AI Services | Tech Stack]]

For local, self-hosted AI applications, a robust infrastructure is essential:
*   **Docker:** Necessary to ensure a sound infrastructure for self-hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Ollama:** Used for the Large Language Model (LLM), capable of hosting a wide variety of LLMs like Llama 3.1 70b <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Qdrant:** Serves as the vector database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Supabase (self-hosted):** Manages authentication and PostgreSQL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **PG Vector:** Can be used as a PostgreSQL extension for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) instead of Qdrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **n8n:** Provides no-code workflow automations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Redis:** Utilized for caching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Managed Services [[Tech Stack for Managed AI Services | Tech Stack]]

Managed services often share similar names with local stacks, which can facilitate migration if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>:
*   **LLMs:** Claude, GPT, or Groq, depending on the specific use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Vector Database:** Pinecone or Qdrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Hosted Supabase:** For PostgreSQL and authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **PG Vector:** Can replace Pinecone or Qdrant for RAG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Cloud n8n:** For no-code workflow automations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Redis.io:** For hosted Redis caching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## [[Decision Making for AI Hosting Solutions | Decision-Making for AI Hosting Solutions]]

The following decision tree helps determine whether a local or managed service approach is best for your AI application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Is It a Simple Proof of Concept (POC)?

*   **Yes:** Go with managed services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Managed services are significantly quicker to get up and running, allowing for rapid iteration and scrapping if the concept isn't viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. It's easy to mock or redact sensitive data for POCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Using similar technologies between managed and local services makes it easier to migrate to local for production if the POC is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **No:** Proceed to the next question.

### Is Your Data Sensitive?

*   **Yes:** Go local for almost everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Feeding sensitive data into public LLMs like GPT could lead to it being trained on and potentially regurgitated to other users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This also applies to cloud databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **No:** Proceed to the next question.

### Do You Need the Latest and Greatest Technology?

*   **Yes:** Typically, you must go with managed services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The compute resources required for powerful LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4 are often too intense to run locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This is critical for advanced tool calling or specific structured output requirements that local models may struggle with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **No:** If local models like Llama 3 70b or Mistral models suffice (determined during POC), proceed to the next question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Are You Scaling Your App to More Than 1,000 Users?

*   **No:** Managed services can be cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The initial overhead of setting up and hosting a local stack on a cloud instance can be more expensive than utilizing the generous free tiers offered by managed services like Pinecone or Supabase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Yes:** It becomes very cost-effective to [[extending_local_ai_infrastructure | go local]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. If you have the knowledge or willingness to learn how to host things locally, this is the recommended path for significant scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. However, some companies prioritize the convenience of managed services even at higher costs for large-scale applications, provided sensitive data is not an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## [[Hybrid Approach in AI Deployments | Hybrid Approach]]

A common strategy for many businesses is adopting a [[Hybrid Approach in AI Deployments | hybrid approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This involves using managed services for some components (e.g., caching, vector databases) while self-hosting others (e.g., LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. While this article simplifies the decision by presenting two extremes (all local or all managed), the [[Hybrid Approach in AI Deployments | hybrid approach]] is a solid option that often combines the benefits of both worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The decision between local and managed AI solutions is nuanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While strong arguments exist for [[local_ai_versus_cloud_ai_benefits | going local]] (especially with the increasing power of local models like Llama), managed services offer speed and convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Considerations like the nature of your project (POC vs. production), data sensitivity, need for cutting-edge technology, and expected user scale should guide your choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Bolt.DIY, formerly known as AutoDev, is poised to become the premier open-source AI coding assistant, following a strategic partnership between Automator (the platform behind AutoDev) and StackBlitz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. This collaboration renames the project to Bolt.DIY, signifying its role as the official open-source version of Bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

## Strategic Partnership and Renaming

The partnership between Automator and StackBlitz aims to "supercharge" the project beyond initial expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Eric, CEO of StackBlitz, credits the community that built AutoDev (now [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | Bolt.DIY]]) for its "amazing innovation," particularly the ability to integrate any type of Large Language Model (LLM) to power the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

The renaming to Bolt.DIY was a necessary step as the project becomes the official open-source version of Bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. The "DIY" (Do-It-Yourself) aspect reflects the project's goals of allowing users to run it themselves, test with local LLMs, and implement cutting-edge features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.

> "Automator... is partnering with StackBlitz to make AutoDev the official open-source version of bolt.new and we will be renaming to bolt.DIY." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>

## Core Vision: The Best Open-Source AI Coding Assistant

The overarching vision for Bolt.DIY is to build the "best open-source AI coding assistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This partnership is seen as the "best case scenario" to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

## Role in LLM Testing and Frontier AI Research

A significant aspect of Bolt.DIY's vision, highlighted by Eric, is its role in evaluating and benchmarking cutting-edge AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Commercial software with AI agents lacked good production examples, leading to Bolt's open-sourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Frontier research labs are now using Bolt.DIY to test their next-generation models because it provides a real-world application benchmark, akin to asking "can it run Crysis?" for PC gaming in the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This capability is changing how models are trained and will benefit future AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

The project allows immediate testing of new LLMs; for example, when "quen 2.5 coder 32b" was released, it was running on [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | Bolt.DIY]] within six hours to assess its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## [[educational_potential_and_community_involvement_with_bolt_diy | Educational Platform]]

Beyond its role as a testing ground, Bolt.DIY also serves as an educational project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Many users struggle with AI coding assistants, getting poor results and blaming the LLM for hallucinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Bolt.DIY aims to teach users how to effectively work with these tools as a co-pilot, even though they can generate full-stack applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. It fills a significant gap in providing real-world examples for education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

## Relationship with Bolt.new

Bolt.DIY and Bolt.new will diverge, which is a beneficial development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. This divergence means Bolt.DIY can implement features without needing to consider if they align with Bolt.new's commercial vision, as the projects have different goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

*   **Bolt.new:** The stable product for easily building applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   **Bolt.DIY:** A platform for experimentation, pushing limits, building custom features, and working with different LLMs, offering features that the commercial Bolt.new might not have due to the speed of open-source development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

Despite the divergence, both projects will continue to share ideas, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. Ideas developed in the open-source version, such as persistence of chat messages and rollbacks, have already contributed to Bolt.new's product roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

## [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | Community]] and Creative Freedom

The Automator Think Tank will remain the home for the Bolt.DIY community, fostering a vibrant environment for sharing ideas and collaborative project work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

While the GitHub repository for Bolt.DIY will move to the StackBlitz Lab organization, its history, stars, forks, commits, pull requests, and issues will remain intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

Crucially, the Bolt.DIY team will retain complete creative freedom over implementations, community management, roadmap, and project direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

[[musthave_mcp_servers_for_ai_coding | MCP servers]] are a core component of an AI coding workflow, allowing AI coding assistants to build anything fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. They can transform any AI coding workflow, regardless of the desired build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Core [[musthave_mcp_servers_for_ai_coding | MCP Servers]] in AI Coding Workflow

The current workflow for coding anything with AI revolves around three core [[musthave_mcp_servers_for_ai_coding | MCP servers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While there are multiple options for each server type, the focus is on one primary recommendation for each category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These servers are typically free to get started with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, often offering generous free tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### 1. External Knowledge and Documentation (RAG Knowledge Base)

This type of [[musthave_mcp_servers_for_ai_coding | MCP server]] is essential for bringing external knowledge, such as library and tool documentation (e.g., Superbase, Pyantic AI), into an AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. AI coding assistants may not know these tools well, and even built-in documentation support in AI IDEs like Windsurf and Cursor doesn't always work optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

*   **Recommended Server:** A self-built, free, and [[opensource_crawl_for_ai_rag_mcp_server | open-source Crawl for AI RAG MCP server]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   **Features:** Allows crawling any website or documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The knowledge built is stored in a private Superbase, making it a self-managed knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Alternative:** Contact 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   **Features:** More out-of-the-box, with thousands of libraries already ingested into its knowledge base, ready for immediate leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. However, it does not build a private knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### 2. Database Management

This server type helps manage databases, enabling AI coding assistants to not only write code but also create database elements like new functions and tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

*   **Recommended Server:** Superbase [[implementing_mcp_servers_in_ai_agent_systems | MCP server]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   **Capabilities:** Can create tables, list projects within a Superbase organization, and write almost any SQL query using natural language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This allows the AI to build all necessary tables as part of the application development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Alternative:** Neon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   **Features:** A serverless PostgreSQL platform with a similar [[implementing_mcp_servers_in_ai_agent_systems | MCP server]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Future Outlook:** It is expected that most databases will eventually have an [[implementing_mcp_servers_in_ai_agent_systems | MCP server]] available for natural language management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### 3. Web Search

This [[musthave_mcp_servers_for_ai_coding | MCP server]] is used for searching the web, providing supplemental resources to the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

*   **Recommended Server:** Brave [[implementing_mcp_servers_in_ai_agent_systems | MCP server]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   **Features:** The Brave API is affordable and powerful, offering an AI-centric web search that summarizes information effectively for LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   **Usage:** Typically used in tandem with the RAG [[musthave_mcp_servers_for_ai_coding | MCP server]] to find supplemental resources like documentation not in the knowledge base, or community forum posts providing examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Web search can provide context on how different libraries work together, complementing knowledge base information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## [[setting_up_and_using_mcp_servers | Setting Up and Using MCP Servers]]

To [[integrating_mcp_with_ai_agents | integrate MCP servers]] into AI coding workflows, detailed instructions are typically provided through links in video descriptions or within the server's documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Configuration in AI IDEs

[[integration_of_mcp_in_ai_tools | MCP servers]] are configured within AI IDEs such as Windsurf, Cursor, or Rue Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The configuration process is generally very similar across different [[integrating_mcp_with_ai_agents | MCP servers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

*   **Accessing Configuration:** In Windsurf, for example, configuration is accessed via the hammer icon for [[musthave_mcp_servers_for_ai_coding | MCP servers]] in cascade mode, leading to a JSON file for configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Adding Servers:** Each server is added individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   For the Crawl for AI server, it needs to be running on SSE in a terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
    *   For Brave Search, an API key is required, and it's typically pulled through MPX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
    *   For Superbase, an access token needs to be set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Loading Servers:** After configuration and saving, refreshing the settings loads the [[musthave_mcp_servers_for_ai_coding | MCP servers]], exposing their tools and descriptions to the AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This provides "superpowers" to the AI coders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Workflow with AI Coding Assistants

When using [[building_mcp_servers | MCP servers]] with AI coding assistants, it's beneficial to set up global or workspace rules and planning/task files to guide the AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

*   **Prompting:** When prompting the AI:
    *   Direct it to read planning and task files first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
    *   Describe desired components for the AI agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
    *   Provide examples (e.g., existing Streamlit interfaces or SQL for database creation) to guide the AI, which is a powerful technique for AI coding assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
    *   Explicitly instruct the AI to use the [[musthave_mcp_servers_for_ai_coding | MCP servers]] early in the process to ensure all necessary documentation is available before code generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This prevents the AI from looking up documentation after writing code, ensuring the [[benefits_of_mcp_for_ai_development | benefits of mCP]] are fully leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Execution:** The AI will first review planning and task documents, then use [[integrating_mcp_with_ai_agents | MCP servers]] for knowledge lookups and web searches before beginning to write code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. It will perform multiple searches with different queries to ensure a comprehensive understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

This comprehensive approach allows the AI to efficiently build complex applications, such as a RAG AI agent with Pyantic AI and Superbase, significantly reducing development time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

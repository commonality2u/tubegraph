Building full-stack AI applications often requires platforms that can handle both [[Building AI Agents | AI agent]] creation and website development seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While many no-code platforms exist for either AI agents or websites, few excel at both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article explores Moment as a solution for [[Building fullscale AI agents | building full-stack AI applications]] without coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Challenge with Popular No-Code Builders (e.g., Bubble)

Many popular app builders, such as Bubble, are integrating with generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, a significant issue with these platforms is their hidden fees, which can lead to substantial costs once an AI application begins to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Unpredictable Pricing of Bubble

Bubble's pricing appears predictable initially, offering a free tier and set monthly fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, this breaks down upon closer inspection of their "workload units" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>:
*   **Workload Units:** These measure operations like requests to a database or API calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Limits and Overage Charges:** Users are limited in the number of workload units included in their plan, after which they pay per 1,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Rapid Consumption:** Applications quickly hit these limits because every user action, such as refreshing a page or navigating to a new one, expends multiple workload units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Example Cost:** Some Bubble-built websites incur costs of around 10 cents every time a user reloads a page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. A comparison test showed operations that were free on Moment cost $155 and took 1 minute and 18 seconds on Bubble, due to 5,000 workload units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

> [!warning]
> This pricing model makes costs unpredictable and can quickly drain a bank account as an application scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Moment: The Solution for No-Code AI App Building

Moment offers a platform that addresses the issues of cost and integration for full-stack AI applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Predictable Pricing of Moment

Moment's pricing is entirely predictable because instead of charging per workload unit, it charges for the underlying infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This means users pay for resources like cores, memory, and database storage, with guaranteed fixed monthly costs regardless of user activity or API calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Moment also offers a free tier with free AI credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

> [!info]
> This predictable pricing is highly recommended when choosing any platform or service, whether for app builders or [[Building AI Agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Example: AI Agent for Task Extraction from Meeting Notes

An example application built on Moment demonstrates its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>:

### Agent Functionality
This AI agent is designed to extract action items from meeting notes and add them to a calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Workflow Process
1.  **Input Meeting Notes**: The user pastes meeting notes into the front-end UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
2.  **Workflow Trigger**: Clicking a "Get Started" button initiates a workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
3.  **Data Ingestion**: The workflow first gets initial context (meeting notes) and inserts them into a database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
4.  **AI Extraction**: The AI agent is called within the workflow to extract action items from the notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
5.  **Database Storage**: The agent's response (extracted tasks) is stored in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
6.  **Front-End Display**: The extracted action items and their schedules are dynamically displayed in the UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
7.  **Calendar Integration**: Users can then add these tasks to their Google Calendar via API integrations managed within Moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The application successfully identifies and schedules tasks like "hire a media buyer," "plan marketing campaign," and "prepare media for campaign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

The creator of [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]], an [[archon_as_an_opensource_ai_agent_builder | open-source AI agent builder]], has outlined ambitious plans for its future development, aiming to evolve it into a powerful tool for generating and managing [[introduction_to_archon | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The development is being done in public, encouraging contributions and serving as an [[educational_framework_utilizing_archon_for_ai_development | educational framework utilizing Archon for AI development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Overarching Vision

The long-term vision for [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] is to build it into an "absolute monster of an [[introduction_to_archon | AI agent]]" that can [[creating_specialized_ai_agent_armies_with_archon | spin up other agents on demand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This includes not only creating agent code but also autonomously iterating on and running these agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The project aims to make [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] one of the most important [[introduction_to_archon | AI agents]] by focusing on specialized solutions for code generation, particularly for building other [[introduction_to_archon | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The development is structured in iterations, allowing for public contribution and serving as an [[archon_as_a_teaching_tool | Archon as a teaching tool]] to demonstrate complex agent building steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Planned Iterations

The creator has detailed extensive plans for future versions of [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]]:

### Version 5: Multi-Agent Coding Workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>
This version will split the primary coding agent into specialized sub-agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. These sub-agents will handle different parts of code generation, such as:
*   Creating the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>
*   Defining tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>
*   Creating dependencies (e.g., database connections, API keys) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>
*   Creating the agent instance and defining its Large Language Model (LLM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>

This approach leverages the benefit of different LLMs tackling different parts of a problem and helps prevent LLMs from being overwhelmed by too many instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

### Version 6: Tool Library and Example Integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>
This iteration will introduce pre-built tools and example agents to assist [[archons_ai_agent_building_process | Archon's AI agent building process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Tool Library**: Will contain predefined tools (e.g., web search, database querying) that [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] can inject into agent code instead of building them from scratch, reducing hallucination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Example Agents**: Will provide foundational structures for agents (e.g., a basic weather agent), allowing [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] to build upon them for more complex use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### Version 7: LangGraph Documentation Integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>
Initially, [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] focuses on Pydantic [[introduction_to_archon | AI]] and LangChain. Version 7 will expand [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]]'s knowledge base by including LangGraph documentation, enabling it to work with more frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This is a step towards allowing users to choose the framework for agent creation, or for [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] to intelligently determine the best framework based on the agent's requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

### Version 8: Self-Feedback Loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>
This version will enhance [[archons_ai_agent_building_process | Archon's agentic workflow]] by implementing self-feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Instead of solely relying on user feedback, [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] will autonomously iterate on agents, correcting silly hallucinations or issues where it "knows better" than the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

### Version 9: Self-Agent Execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>
This is a more challenging but crucial part of the development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Current [[introduction_to_archon | AI coding assistants]] often don't execute the code they build. Version 9 will enable [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] to automatically set up an isolated environment using the Local [[introduction_to_archon | AI]] package, complete with databases (vector, SQL) and web search capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This allows for automated testing and execution of generated agents, leading to more robust autonomous iteration based on actual agent performance and error detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

### Version 10: Multi-Framework Support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>
While focusing on Pydantic [[introduction_to_archon | AI]] and LangGraph, [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] plans to support other major frameworks like Crew [[introduction_to_archon | AI]], LlamaIndex, and Autogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. This will provide users with more options and cater to different preferences for agent development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

### Version 11: Autonomous Framework Learning Process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
This advanced feature aims for [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] to continuously improve itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. When [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] successfully creates or iterates on an agent, it will add those successful examples and tools to its internal library. This self-improvement mechanism could also include adjusting its own system prompt based on what produces the best-performing agents over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

### Version 12: Advanced RAG Techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>
To improve how [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] utilizes documentation, advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques will be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. This includes hybrid search, re-ranking, query decomposition, and better chunking methods like hierarchical chunking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

### Version 13: MCP Agent Marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>
The final planned version, for now, involves creating an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Agent Marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. This would allow users to publish [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]]-built agents to a marketplace, making them reusable as sub-agents within other [[introduction_to_archon | AI]] IDEs or MCP clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

## Future Integrations

Beyond specific versions, the developer plans to integrate [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] with several other services:
*   **LangSmith/Langfuse**: For tracing and monitoring agentic workflows, aiding in debugging [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] and the agents it creates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
*   **[[archon_ai_agent_builder | Archon]] in MCP Marketplaces**: Enabling users to access [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] directly as an MCP server without needing to manually set up the GitHub repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Other Vector Databases**: Including Quadrant (faster, self-hostable) and Pinecone (serverless, very fast), to offer more flexibility beyond Superbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.
*   **Local [[introduction_to_archon | AI]] package**: Essential for the self-agent execution functionality planned for Version 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

The creator emphasizes that these plans are designed to make [[introduction_to_archon | Archon]] a powerful and practical tool, while also serving as an [[educational_framework_utilizing_archon_for_ai_development | educational framework]] for understanding complex [[introduction_to_archon | AI agent]] development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

Last week, [[automator_enhancing_the_learning_and_application_of_ai | Automator]] announced its partnership with StackBlitz, designating [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | bolt.DIY]] as the official open-source bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This announcement significantly boosted the community and project's engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Purpose and Goals
The primary goal of this partnership is to maintain momentum and transform this opportunity into building "the best open-source AI coding assistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The team is thinking long-term for [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | bolt.DIY]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Key Objectives:
*   Become the official open-source bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   Build the best open-source AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Financial Incentives
The partnership with StackBlitz includes financial incentives for the [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | bolt.DIY]] project itself, not for the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. These funds will be used to host events with cash prizes to incentivize contributions to [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | bolt.DIY]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Impact on Roadmap and Features
The partnership has significantly influenced the development roadmap for [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | bolt.DIY]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Implemented Features (Foundation):
*   Creation of a core maintainer team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Launch of the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   Improved documentation and FAQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Repository improvements, including CI/CD and issue templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Loading local projects in GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   Attaching images to prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   New settings model for improved project maturity, including toggling providers, GitHub connections, and an experimental optimized prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   A debug tab in settings to help users troubleshoot issues and copy system information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   Token usage visibility for every prompt, showing both prompt and completion tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   Full-screen and resize capabilities for the preview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   Ability to screenshot a part of the preview and send it to the LLM for feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

### Future Roadmap (Yet to be Implemented):
*   **Prompt Library**: To accommodate different LLMs (e.g., Claude, Llama, Gemini) with tailored prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **File Walking and Diffs**: Similar to commercial bolt.new, to reduce the need for [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | bolt.DIY]] to rewrite files often. This will involve collaboration with the StackBlitz team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **One-click Deploy to Netlify** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Kanban-style Board**: To manage Pull Requests (PRs), especially high-priority ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Plug-in System/Extension Marketplace**: To make [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | bolt.DIY]] highly extendable, allowing contributions without direct repository edits and avoiding feature bloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This includes:
    *   Backend for extension library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
    *   Frontend for posting and managing plugins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   Potential plugins: Document upload for extra knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, better pre-coding planning steps (e.g., reasoning models) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, Supabase integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Agentic System Backend**: Enabling a "mixture of experts" (agents) to create code instead of a single LLM call, potentially allowing better results with smaller LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Community Involvement
The community is encouraged to contribute to the roadmap and project development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. New feature ideas can be discussed in the "new feature discussions" subcategory within the [[automator_enhancing_the_learning_and_application_of_ai | Automator]] Think Tank, or contributors can directly implement features via pull requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

The project actively provides resources to help users get started with [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | bolt.DIY]], including guides for self-hosting (e.g., on Ubuntu, Windows, and Cloudflare Pages) and troubleshooting common issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

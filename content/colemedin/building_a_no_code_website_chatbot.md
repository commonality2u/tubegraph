One of the most common applications for AI agents is [[integrating chatbots with website | creating a custom website chatbot]] using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that is trained on specific data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This type of chatbot can answer user questions about products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Such a chatbot is a valuable tool for virtually any business with a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Why Use a No-Code Solution?

While coding AI agents is possible, using a dedicated product or service can be more efficient for certain tasks, especially for [[customizing chatbots for business needs | custom chatbots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Folder is presented as an "absolute gem" of a product that simplifies the process of [[building a powerful chatbot using Llama 3 1 405B | building custom RAG chatbots]] for websites with [[no code AI app builders | no code]] in under five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Getting Started with Folder

Getting started with Folder is straightforward:
1.  Navigate to folder.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
2.  Click "Get Started" to create an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
Folder offers a free tier and a free trial for its premium features, allowing users to explore its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Creating an Assistant

After account creation, users are directed to a dashboard where they can create their first "assistant," which serves as the core of the chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The process involves:
*   Giving the assistant a name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Choosing an AI model from available options like Claude and GPT (Llama is noted as "coming soon") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Setting up conversation starters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   Defining a "base prompt" or system message, which provides instructions for the assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Selecting a personality for the assistant (e.g., "focused") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Training the Chatbot with RAG

Once the assistant is created, it can be trained using RAG by uploading various data sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>:
*   Files such as PDFs and text documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   Files from Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   Content from YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   Data from a JSON API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The training process is quick; for example, training on five PDF and text documents can take around 20 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. After training, the assistant can accurately answer questions based on the provided documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## [[integrating chatbots with website | Integrating the Chatbot with Your Website]]

After the assistant is trained, it can be added to a website chatbot tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Folder offers several customization options for the chatbot's appearance and functionality:
*   Changing the initial message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Adjusting branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   Setting the popup position on the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   Enabling lead information capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Once published, Folder provides embed code that can be copied and pasted into any website, regardless of whether it's built with a landing page builder or custom coded with frameworks like React <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This simplifies [[integrating AI chatbots on websites | integrating AI chatbots on websites]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Workflow Automation with Folder

Folder also includes a workflow view feature, allowing users to create automations that leverage their built assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. For example, an assistant can be prompted to extract action items from meeting notes and then send those items via text message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

While other workflow builders like [[using no code and low code tools like n8n and Voiceflow | n8n]], Zapier, and Make.com exist, Folder's unique advantage is the ability to directly use the assistants built within its platform for automations involving SMS, Google Drive, Slack, and other integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Folder plans to add more integrations in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

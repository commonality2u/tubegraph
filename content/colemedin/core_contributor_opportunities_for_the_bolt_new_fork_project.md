The maintainer of the [[introduction_to_ottodev_and_the_boltnew_fork | Bolt.new fork]] is actively seeking applications for core contributors to help manage the rapidly expanding project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This initiative aims to ensure the long-term success and continued development of the [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | open-source AI coding assistant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Why Core Contributors Are Needed
The [[bolt_new_fork_introduction_and_its_community_engagement | Bolt.new fork]] project has experienced significant growth, with 20 pull requests received in a single week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This rapid expansion necessitates additional help to maintain the project effectively and manage dozens of pull requests weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The maintainer is committed to treating this as a long-term community-driven endeavor, not just a content project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Role of a Core Contributor
While anyone is welcome to contribute by [[forking_open_source_platforms_for_custom_modifications | forking the repository]] and submitting pull requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, a core contributor holds a more direct role as a project maintainer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This access allows them to:
*   Approve pull requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>
*   Merge pull requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
*   Make emergency bug fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>

## Application Process
Applications for core contributor roles are open via a Google Form, linked in the video's description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Ideal candidates should possess significant experience in:
*   Developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
*   Generative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
*   Open-source projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>

A high volume of applications is anticipated, and while qualifications are important, the maintainer plans to accept many applications to address the project's growing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Project Growth and Future Outlook
The [[community_involvement_in_bolt_diy_project | community]] around the Bolt.new fork is actively building what is envisioned as the best open-source AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Community Platform:** A Discourse community forum will soon be launched to facilitate discussions, plan [[future_enhancements_and_highpriority_items_for_bolt_new | upcoming changes]], and maintain the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This forum will also be part of a larger community hub for the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Content Updates:** Regular content will be created on the channel about the project, including a tutorial on setting it up locally using Docker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Weekly updates are also being considered to keep the project moving quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Recent Additions:** Many features have been added to the fork, as detailed in the [[recent_updates_and_features_in_bolt_new_fork | recent updates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The maintainer ensures every pull request is reviewed, tested, and feedback is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

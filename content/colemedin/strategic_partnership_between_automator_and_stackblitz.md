A strategic partnership has been announced between Automator and StackBlitz, which will supercharge the AutoDev project beyond previous expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This [[partnership_between_automator_and_stack_blitz | partnership]] designates AutoDev, a fork of Bolt.new developed by the Automator community, as the official open-source version of Bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Consequently, AutoDev will be renamed to Bolt.DIY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Vision for Bolt.DIY

The partnership aligns the visions of both Automator and StackBlitz for Bolt.DIY:

*   **Real-world Testing for AI Models** Eric, CEO of StackBlitz, highlighted that Bolt.DIY is being used by "Frontier research labs" to test their next-generation AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It provides a reliable, real-world benchmark for AI models, filling a significant gap in the open-source world for production AI agent examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, and is helping to advance the capabilities of these models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Educational Platform** Bolt.DIY aims to be an excellent platform for learning how to effectively work with [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | AI coding assistants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This addresses the common issue of users getting poor results and blaming the LLM, when often it's due to a lack of understanding in working with such tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Cutting-Edge Open-Source Product** Bolt.DIY will function as a fully-fledged product that users can run themselves, compatible with local Large Language Models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. As an open-source repository, it can move quickly and implement cutting-edge features that the commercial Bolt.new might not have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Benefits of the Partnership

This [[partnership_between_automator_and_stack_blitz | partnership]] is considered the "best case scenario" for Bolt.DIY and the Automator community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
It enables the project to confidently claim it is building the best open-source [[using_bolt_diy_as_an_ai_coding_assistant | AI coding assistant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The collaboration allows for a mutual sharing of ideas, contributing to product roadmaps and fostering innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Transition Details

While the transition is expected to have some minor challenges, key aspects of the partnership and transition have been outlined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>:

*   **Community Home** The Automator Think Tank will continue to be the primary home for the Bolt.DIY community, fostering a vibrant environment for sharing ideas and project collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Repository Location** The Bolt.DIY repository will move to the StackBlitz Labs organization on GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. However, all existing data, including stars, forks, commit history, pull requests, and issues, will be preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Creative Freedom** The Automator team will maintain complete creative freedom over Bolt.DIY's implementation, community management, and roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Project Divergence** The commercial Bolt.new and the open-source Bolt.DIY will diverge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This divergence is beneficial, allowing Bolt.DIY to implement features independently without concern for Bolt.new's specific requirements, given their distinct visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Name Change** The name change from AutoDev to Bolt.DIY, while a loss of an established name, makes sense as it signifies its official connection to Bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The "DIY" (Do-It-Yourself) aspect aligns well with the project's goals of allowing users to run the software themselves, test with local LLMs, and experiment with cutting-edge features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

Further announcements regarding Bolt.DIY and Automator, including events with StackBlitz and involvement of their open-source experts, are expected soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

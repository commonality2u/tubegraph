Working with [[using_local_large_language_models_with_autod_dev|local large language models]] (LLMs) is considered a skill in itself due to the various factors involved in understanding, acquiring, and utilizing them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This includes comprehending [[hardware_requirements_for_running_large_language_models_locally|hardware requirements for running local LLMs]] when self-hosting, understanding how to obtain them, and mastering fine-tuning techniques to adapt them to specific datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. It also involves knowing when to choose [[comparison_between_local_and_large_ai_models|local LLMs]] over cloud-based alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

## Current Landscape and Future Trends
Currently, proprietary or "closed" LLMs like Claude and GPT, which cannot be downloaded and run locally, generally outperform local models such as Quen and Llama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. However, the performance gap between these two categories is rapidly closing, especially with the emergence of powerful new local models like DeepSeek V3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. The capabilities of [[using_local_large_language_models_with_autod_dev|local large language models]] are becoming increasingly impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

## Advantages of Local LLMs
[[benefits_of_hosting_your_own_large_language_models|Local large language models]] offer several significant advantages:
*   **Fine-tuning** – The ability to train an LLM on your own specific data to improve its performance for your particular use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Data Privacy** – Running the LLM on your own infrastructure ensures utmost data privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Cost Efficiency** – Depending on the use case, local LLMs can be more cost-effective as you avoid API costs associated with cloud models, only needing to cover your own hardware or hosting fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Speed** – With adequate [[hardware_requirements_for_running_large_language_models_locally|hardware]], local LLMs can often be faster because they eliminate network delays from API calls across the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   **Flexibility** – There are significantly more local LLM options available for download from platforms like Hugging Face or Ollama compared to closed LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. This includes many fascinating domain-specific LLMs for tasks like creative writing and coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

These benefits are making [[using_local_large_language_models_with_autod_dev|local AI]] increasingly practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## Integration into AI Systems
The decision of whether to use [[comparing_local_and_cloudbased_large_language_models|local]] or cloud-based LLMs is one of the most critical choices when building an AI tech stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. This involves choosing whether to host your LLM, database, and other infrastructure components yourself or rely on cloud services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

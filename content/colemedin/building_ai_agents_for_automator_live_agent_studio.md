## [[Building AI agents for Automator Live Agent Studio]] Hackathon

[[automator_enhancing_the_learning_and_application_of_ai | Automator]] is hosting a hackathon competition featuring $5,000 in cash prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. To participate, individuals must [[building_ai_agents | build an AI agent]] for the [[automator_enhancing_the_learning_and_application_of_ai | Automator]] Live Agent Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This initiative aims to engage the community with the Live Agent Studio in an exciting way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The challenge is to [[building_ai_agents | build an incredible AI agent]] that addresses a real-world problem, offering participants the chance to win money and display their [[understanding_ai_agents | AI]] mastery globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The field of [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] is described as a "wild west" where anything is possible, with development currently "scratching the surface" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The competition is designed to be the "most straightforward and fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### About the Live Agent Studio

The Live Agent Studio is a community-driven platform, launched in pre-release, that hosts various cutting-edge [[understanding_ai_agents | agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. These [[understanding_ai_agents | agents]] are open-source, allowing users to download and learn from their implementation for personal or business use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Participation and Building Criteria

To participate, individuals need to [[building_ai_agents | build an AI agent]] following the developer guide, with resources and templates available to facilitate getting started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Supported platforms for [[building_ai_agents | AI agent]] development include:
*   Any [[building_ai_agents | AI agent]] within a Docker container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   Any [[building_ai_agents_with_python | Python]] agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Agents built with NNN flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Agents built with [[deploying_ai_agents_using_voice_flow | Voice Flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>

### Sponsors and Partnerships

[[deploying_ai_agents_using_voice_flow | Voice Flow]] is a sponsor of the hackathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. [[deploying_ai_agents_using_voice_flow | Voice Flow]] is an [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agent]] development platform that offers no-code/low-code solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A direct integration with [[deploying_ai_agents_using_voice_flow | Voice Flow]] is being created within the Live Agent Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. As part of their sponsorship, $1,000 of the prize pool is allocated for the best and second-best [[deploying_ai_agents_using_voice_flow | agents built specifically with Voice Flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Registered participants will receive a special link for free [[deploying_ai_agents_using_voice_flow | Voice Flow]] tokens and an extended trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Additional partnerships with other platforms are expected to be announced during the registration period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

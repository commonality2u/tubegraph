[[no_code_ai_app_builders | No code AI app builders]] like [[comparison_between_bubble_and_moment_for_ai_apps | Bubble]] are popular platforms for creating AI applications and websites [00:00:04]. However, a significant issue with these platforms is their hidden fees, which can become very expensive as an application scales [00:00:28].

## Hidden Fees and Scaling Issues

When building a full-stack AI application without coding, both an AI agent builder and a website/app builder are necessary [00:00:14]. Many popular [[no_code_ai_app_builders | app builders]], such as [[comparison_between_bubble_and_moment_for_ai_apps | Bubble]], are integrating with generative AI [00:00:21]. However, these platforms often have substantial hidden fees that can drain finances as an AI application grows [00:00:30].

> [[comparison_between_bubble_and_moment_for_ai_apps | Bubble]] can charge "out the wazoo" and quickly deplete bank accounts, especially when scaling an AI application [00:00:43].

## Understanding Bubble's Pricing Structure

[[comparison_between_bubble_and_moment_for_ai_apps | Bubble]]'s pricing page initially appears to offer predictable monthly costs, including a free tier [00:01:57]. However, the problem arises in the details of their plans [00:02:06].

*   **Workload Units (WUs)**: [[comparison_between_bubble_and_moment_for_ai_apps | Bubble]] limits the number of operations, referred to as "workload units," that an application can make [00:02:14]. These units encompass actions like database requests and API calls [00:02:18].
*   **Over-limit Charges**: Users are limited in the number of workload units they receive before they have to start paying per 1,000 workload units [00:02:25].
*   **Rapid Consumption**: Applications quickly hit this limit because every user action, such as refreshing a page or navigating to a new one, expends multiple workload units through API and database operations [00:02:32].
*   **Cost per Unit**: Once the limit is reached, users pay 30 cents for every 1,000 interactions with APIs or databases [00:02:49]. This cost can add up very quickly [00:02:55].

For example, some websites built with [[comparison_between_bubble_and_moment_for_ai_apps | Bubble]] have been observed to cost approximately 10 cents every time a user reloaded a page [00:02:58]. This structure makes the pricing unpredictable, which is not ideal for application development [00:03:08].

## Real-World Cost Comparison

A test conducted by the Moment team illustrates the significant cost difference between platforms. Operations that could be performed on Moment's free tier cost [[comparison_between_bubble_and_moment_for_ai_apps | Bubble]] $155 for 5,000 workload units [00:04:20]. Specifically, a task that took 1 minute and 18 seconds on [[comparison_between_bubble_and_moment_for_ai_apps | Bubble]] incurred this $155 charge, while it was free and very fast on Moment [00:04:37]. This demonstrates that users can save thousands of dollars by avoiding platforms with such unpredictable pricing models as offered by [[comparison_between_bubble_and_moment_for_ai_apps | Bubble]] [00:04:52].

[[comparison_between_bubble_and_moment_for_ai_apps | Bubble]]'s pricing, characterized by hidden fees and charges based on workload units, is deemed ridiculous when compared to more predictable infrastructure-based pricing models [00:03:06].

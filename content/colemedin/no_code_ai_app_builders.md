[[no_code_ai_agent_builders | No code AI app builders]] enable users to create [[developing_ai_agents_without_coding | AI agents]] and websites without writing any code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For building a full-stack AI application without coding, both an AI agent builder and a website builder are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Challenges with Popular Platforms

Many popular app builders that integrate with generative AI, such as Bubble, have significant drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. A major issue with these platforms is the presence of numerous hidden fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These fees can quickly accumulate as an AI application scales, leading to substantial costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

For instance, Bubble's pricing model, while appearing predictable with monthly fees and a free tier, breaks down upon closer inspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Users are limited in the number of "workload units" (operations like database requests or API calls) they can make before incurring additional charges per 1,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. An application can hit this limit very quickly, as actions like refreshing a page can expend multiple workload units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. After hitting the limit, Bubble charges 30 cents for every 1,000 interactions with APIs or databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, making the pricing unpredictable and potentially very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Some websites built with Bubble have cost 10 cents for a single page reload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Moment: An Affordable Alternative

Moment is a platform designed to solve the challenges of building and [[deploying_ai_applications_without_coding | deploying AI applications without coding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. It allows for the creation of full-stack AI applications with no code, offering an easy and affordable solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Key Features of Moment:
*   **Complex AI Agents**: Moment supports building complex [[developing_ai_agents_without_coding | AI agents]] with features like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), tool calling, and dynamic prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Robust Website/App Builder**: It integrates a strong front-end builder, enabling users to create robust websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Database Management**: Users can manage their databases directly within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **API Connections**: The platform facilitates API connections for tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Workflow Builder**: It includes a workflow builder for creating automated processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Predictable Pricing**: Unlike per-operation pricing, Moment's pricing is entirely predictable, based on allocated infrastructure (cores, memory, database storage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This ensures a consistent monthly cost regardless of user interaction frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Free Tier**: Moment offers a free tier that allows users to perform operations that would cost significant money on other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. A test showed operations costing $155 on Bubble could be done for free on Moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Building an AI Agent with Moment

Moment's own website was built using the Moment app builder, showcasing its capability to create robust and visually appealing front-ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Getting started is free, providing access to AI credits and the app builder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Example: Meeting Notes Task Extractor
An example AI agent built on Moment extracts tasks from meeting notes and adds them to a calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

#### Agent Configuration
*   **Model Selection**: Users can select their AI model and temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Prompting**: Meeting notes are passed as input to the agent, integrated into the prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Instructions, roles, and constraints can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Integrations**: [[developing_ai_agents_without_coding | AI agents]] can interact with the outside world by integrating third-party APIs and data for tool calling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Workflows from the action flow tab can also be used as tools for the agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Structured Output**: The agent can be configured for structured output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Testing**: Agents can be tested directly within the platform by starting a conversation on the right-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

#### Front-End Development
Moment's website builder includes:
*   **Components**: A wide variety of components can be added to the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness**: It's easy to make websites mobile-responsive, previewing how they look on phones and tablets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Customization**: Extensive customization options are available for each component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Workflow Integration**: Buttons and other elements can trigger workflows created within the Moment app, facilitating integration between the front end and the [[developing_ai_agents_without_coding | AI agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

#### Workflow and API Management
*   **Action Flow**: Workflows manage interactions with services like Google Calendar and the [[developing_ai_agents_without_coding | AI agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Database Integration**: Workflows can get initial context (e.g., meeting notes) and insert them into a database for tracking conversations and messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Agent Calls**: The [[developing_ai_agents_without_coding | AI agent]] can be called directly within a workflow to extract information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **API Integrations**: Moment allows easy setup of any API endpoint with necessary parameters, such as managing Google credentials and creating calendar events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

#### Live Demo
A demo involved pasting fake meeting notes into the Moment front-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The system then ran the workflow to send the notes to the LLM (Large Language Model), extract action items, and dynamically display them in the UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The extracted tasks were then added to a Google Calendar via API integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This demonstrates how a [[developing_ai_agents_without_coding | no code AI agent]] can manage tasks, and potentially integrate with other task management software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Moment offers a robust application development environment, combining front-end capabilities with powerful [[developing_ai_agents_without_coding | AI agents]] and predictable pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. It allows for the creation of complex [[deploying_ai_applications_without_coding | AI applications]] with practical business value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

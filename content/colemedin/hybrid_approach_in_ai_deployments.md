A common strategy for many businesses when [[deploying_ai_applications_to_the_cloud | deploying AI applications]] is to adopt a hybrid approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This involves using both [[local_vs_managed_ai_solutions | local]] (self-hosted) and [[tech_stack_for_managed_ai_services | managed services]] for various components of an AI solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Components in a Hybrid Setup
In a hybrid AI deployment, specific components might be handled differently:
*   **[[tech_stack_for_managed_ai_services | Managed Services]]**: Elements like caching and vector databases could be managed through cloud services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **[[local_vs_managed_ai_solutions | Local]] / Self-hosted**: Other components, such as the Large Language Model (LLM), might be self-hosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

This blend allows businesses to leverage the benefits of both approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

> [!INFO] Why not covered in the decision tree?
> While a hybrid approach is considered "really, really solid," the video's decision tree focuses on the extremes of "all [[local_vs_managed_ai_solutions | local]]" or "all [[tech_stack_for_managed_ai_services | managed services]]" to provide a simpler and clearer picture for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. However, the underlying principle still requires a decision on whether to lean more towards [[local_vs_managed_ai_solutions | local]] or [[tech_stack_for_managed_ai_services | managed services]] solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

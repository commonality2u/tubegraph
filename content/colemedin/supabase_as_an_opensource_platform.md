From: [[colemedin]] <br/> 

Supabase is an incredible open-source platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is currently considered the most popular database for [[using_supabase_for_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Core Capabilities

Underneath, Supabase runs on PostgreSQL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This foundation allows it to be used for several critical functions in AI development:
*   **Conversation History and State Management** Supabase can manage conversation history and state for [[using_supabase_for_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Vector Database Functionality** With the PG Vector extension, Supabase can be transformed into a [[using_supabase_as_a_vector_database | vector database]] for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive AI Platform** Its combination of features makes it a perfect platform for [[using_supabase_for_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Additional Features

Beyond its core database capabilities, Supabase provides other valuable [[supabase_features_like_authentication_and_object_storage | features right out of the box]], including:
*   Authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Object storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

These features ensure that there is a place for [[superbase_integration_for_ai_projects | Supabase]] in almost any AI project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Open-Source Benefits and Local Integration

As an entirely open-source platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, Supabase offers significant flexibility, including instructions for [[selfhosting_supabase_with_docker | self-hosting it with Docker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This makes it relatively easy to integrate Supabase into [[integrating_local_ai_services_with_supabase | local AI services]] and [[building_a_local_ai_package_with_supabase | local AI packages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. While incorporating Supabase may be slightly trickier than other platforms, detailed step-by-step guidance can help quickly get a revamped local AI package up and running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. For those familiar with Supabase, the local experience will be very familiar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The platform can also be used to build a RAG [[using_supabase_for_ai_agents | AI agent]] in [[integrating_n8n_and_supabase | n8n]] that runs entirely locally using a Supabase instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

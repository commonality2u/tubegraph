## Voiceflow Agent Prizes

Voiceflow is sponsoring the hackathon, contributing $1,000 of their sponsorship towards specific prizes for agents built with their platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

*   **Best Voiceflow Agent:** $700 cash prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Second Best Voiceflow Agent:** $300 cash prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

Participants who register for the hackathon will receive a special link providing free tokens for Voiceflow and an extended trial on their platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Prize Allocation

If a participant wins multiple awards (e.g., best overall agent and best Voiceflow agent), they will receive the highest award they have earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This means if the same agent wins both, the participant gets the first-place overall prize, and the next best Voiceflow agent would then receive the Voiceflow-specific award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The intention is that participants will not be "cheated" out of any awards but will receive the highest one they qualify for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

One of the most common applications for AI agents is [[customizing_chatbots_for_business_needs | creating a custom website chatbot]] enhanced with [[enhancing_ai_agents_with_rag_technology | RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)]] technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This type of chatbot is trained on a business's specific data to answer user questions about their products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Benefits and Accessibility
Every business with a website can benefit from a custom RAG chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Tools like Folder make it exceptionally easy to [[building_a_nocode_rag_ai_agent | build these custom RAG chatbots]] for websites with [[agentic_rag_ai_agent_template | no code]] in less than five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While coding [[rag_ai_agent_development | AI agents]] is possible, using a specialized product like Folder is often more efficient for this particular use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Building a Custom RAG Chatbot with Folder

Getting started with Folder is straightforward:
1.  Navigate to folder.com and click "Get Started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
2.  Create an account, utilizing the available free tier or premium feature trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Creating an Assistant
Once on the dashboard, the process involves creating a new "assistant" which will power the chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>:
*   **Name the Assistant** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Choose an AI Model**: Options include Claude, GPT, with Llama coming soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Configure Conversation Starters and Base Prompt**: The base prompt acts as the system message, providing instructions for the assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Set Personality**: Users can select a personality for the chatbot, such as "focused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Training the Assistant with RAG Data
To enable [[contextual_retrieval_in_rag | contextual retrieval]], users upload files to train the RAG model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Supported file types and sources include:
*   PDF documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Text documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   JSON API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>

Training the assistant is typically very fast, taking only about 20 seconds for multiple documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. After training, the assistant can answer questions accurately based on the uploaded data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This process [[improving_rag_ai_agent_accuracy | improves RAG AI agent accuracy]] by grounding responses in specific, provided knowledge.

### Publishing to a Website
Once the assistant is trained, it can be added to a website chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Customization options for the website chatbot include:
*   Changing the initial message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
*   Adjusting branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
*   Selecting the popup position on the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   Enabling lead information capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

After configuring these settings, the chatbot can be published. Folder provides an embed code that can be copied and pasted into any website, whether built with a landing page builder or custom-coded with frameworks like React <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Workflow Automation with Chatbots
Folder also offers a workflow view, allowing users to create automations that leverage their built assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. For example, an assistant can be prompted to extract action items from meeting notes and then send them via text message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. While other workflow builders like [[creating_rag_ai_agents_using_n8n | n8n]], Zapier, and Make.com exist, Folder's unique advantage is the ability to directly integrate and leverage the RAG-powered assistants created within its platform for automations involving SMS, Google Drive, Slack, and other integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

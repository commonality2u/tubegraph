Supabase is an open-source platform widely recognized as a popular database choice for [[using_supabase_for_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its versatility makes it an ideal component for any AI project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Why Supabase for AI Agents?

Underneath its robust platform, Supabase uses PostgreSQL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This allows it to serve multiple functions crucial for AI development:
*   **Conversation History and State Management** Supabase can be utilized to manage the conversation history and state for AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Vector Database Capabilities** With the PG Vector extension, Supabase can be transformed into a vector database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This makes it a perfect platform for [[using_supabase_as_a_vector_database_for_ai_agents | using Supabase as a vector database for AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Additional Features** It provides out-of-the-box features like authentication and object storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Integrating Supabase into Local AI Packages

Given its power and utility, there was significant demand from the community to include Supabase in the [[local_ai_package_setup | local AI package setup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Fortunately, since Supabase is entirely open-source and offers Docker instructions for self-hosting, it's straightforward to bring it into [[integrating_local_ai_services_with_supabase | local AI services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

While incorporating Supabase was slightly more challenging than other platforms, a step-by-step guide is available to help users quickly get the revamped [[local_ai_package_setup | local AI package]] up and running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## What to Expect

For those already familiar with Supabase in a non-local setup, the local instance will appear very familiar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The integration process will also demonstrate how to build a RAG AI agent that runs entirely locally, leveraging the local Supabase instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This highlights the practical application of [[superbase_integration_for_ai_projects | Supabase integration for AI projects]] in a local environment.

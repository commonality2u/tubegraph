From: [[colemedin]] <br/> 
AI agents, which are large language models capable of interacting with the outside world via APIs, web scraping, and code generation, are a pivotal part of the current technological era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Building these agents can be done with either code or no-code solutions, each offering distinct advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

No-code platforms like Flowise and [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] make it incredibly easy to create powerful AI agents without needing to debug or maintain extensive code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Conversely, coding AI agents using languages like Python and libraries such as [[setting_up_ai_agents_with_python_and_langchain | LangChain]] provides maximum customization and control, which no-code tools might sometimes lack, especially for highly specific production requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Many developers begin with no-code but transition to code as needs become more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### The Perfect Trifecta: Combining Code and No-Code
The ideal approach involves combining code and no-code solutions to leverage the strengths of both, creating quick-to-develop yet powerful AI agents that can meet diverse needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This "perfect trifecta" involves using [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] for the agent's tools and Python with [[setting_up_ai_agents_with_python_and_langchain | LangChain]] for the AI agent itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

#### Benefits of using [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] for Tools
[[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] excels at easily setting up credentials for various services and connecting them into workflows that can be exposed as API endpoints for AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. It handles the underlying complexity of interacting with external services, streamlining tool creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

#### Benefits of using Python + [[setting_up_ai_agents_with_python_and_langchain | LangChain]] for the AI Agent
Python coupled with [[setting_up_ai_agents_with_python_and_langchain | LangChain]] allows for the straightforward creation of AI agents with any Large Language Model (LLM) using very few lines of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Integration with [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] workflows can be achieved in as little as five lines of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This combination provides full customization while still benefiting from the simplicity of [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Example AI Agent Capabilities
An example AI agent built with this stack can perform actions such as:
*   Sending messages in Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   Summarizing conversations in Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>
*   Uploading files to Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>

This setup is highly extensible, allowing for the creation of virtually any workflow in [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] and integrating it into the agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Setting Up the N8N Workflows for Agent Tools
The core idea is to use [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] workflows as callable API endpoints for the Python-based AI agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Each workflow begins and ends with a webhook node, which serves as the API endpoint for invocation and response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### 1. Summarize Slack Conversation Tool
This workflow is designed to pull Slack messages, aggregate them, and then use an LLM to summarize the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Webhook Trigger**: Receives an API call from the Python agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Slack Integration**: Pulls a batch of messages from a specified Slack channel (can be hardcoded or made dynamic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Data Aggregation**: Combines all pulled messages into a single field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **LLM Processing**: Passes the combined messages to an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o Mini) with a prompt to summarize the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Webhook Response**: Returns the LLM's summary back to the calling Python code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### 2. Post Message to Slack Tool
This simpler workflow allows the agent to send a message to a Slack channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Webhook Trigger**: Receives an API call, including the message text in its payload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Slack Integration**: Posts the dynamic message text to a hardcoded or dynamic Slack channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Webhook Response**: Responds with the result of sending the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Slack Credentials
> When setting up Slack credentials in [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]], navigate to "OAuth & Permissions" (not "Add features and functionality > Permissions") within api.slack.com to find the redirect URL and set user token scopes (e.g., to read or send messages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### 3. Create File in Google Drive Tool
This workflow enables the agent to create a Google Doc in a specified folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Webhook Trigger**: Receives an API call with parameters for the file name and content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Google Drive Integration**: Creates a file in a hardcoded Google Drive folder (e.g., "meeting notes") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Conversion**: Includes an option to convert the uploaded text into a proper Google Document rather than a raw .txt file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Webhook Response**: Responds with the outcome of the file creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Coding the AI Agent with Python and LangChain
The Python part of the setup involves defining the agent's logic and integrating it with the [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Project Setup
The project structure includes:
*   A main Python script (`main.py`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   A utility Python script (`tools.py`) for defining [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] interaction tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists necessary Python packages and their versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   `.env.example` (renamed to `.env`): For environment variables like API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI) and [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] web hook URLs and Bearer tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Defining Agent Tools in Python
The `tools.py` script utilizes the `Tool` decorator from [[setting_up_ai_agents_with_python_and_langchain | LangChain]] to turn Python functions into tools that the LLM can understand and invoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

#### `invoke_n8n_webhook` Helper Function
A key component is a helper function that standardizes API requests to [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Parameters**: Takes `method` (GET/POST), `url` (the [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] workflow URL), `function_name` (for AI understanding), and an optional `payload` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Authorization**: Includes a Bearer token in the authorization header <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Error Handling**: Supports both GET and POST requests, raises HTTP errors for statuses like 403 Forbidden, and returns API responses or error messages for the agent to reason about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

This wrapper function makes defining new tools incredibly simple, often requiring only five lines of code per tool by calling `invoke_n8n_webhook` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

#### Tool Definitions
Each tool function (e.g., `summarize_slack_conversation`, `send_slack_message`, `create_google_doc`) is decorated with `@tool` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Docstrings**: Crucially, detailed docstrings describe the tool's purpose, example usage, arguments, and return values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The LLM uses these docstrings to understand when and how to invoke each function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Simplicity**: The actual function logic is minimal, deferring the complexity of external interactions to the [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### Front-End Interaction with Streamlit UI
The `main.py` script sets up a Streamlit UI for user interaction with the AI agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

#### Model Handling and System Message
*   **Model Flexibility**: A helper function allows the agent to use either Anthropic or OpenAI models by handling their slightly different response formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **System Message**: A system message provides initial context to fine-tune the LLM's responses and desired formatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

#### `prompt_ai` Function
This function orchestrates the interaction with the LLM and tool invocation:
*   **Chatbot Setup**: Initializes a `ChatOpenAI` or `ChatAnthropic` instance based on the chosen model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Tool Binding**: Uses [[setting_up_ai_agents_with_python_and_langchain | LangChain]]'s `bind_tools` function to attach the defined tools to the chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   **Streaming Output**: Streams the LLM's response, allowing for a "typewriter" effect in the UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.
*   **Tool Call Handling**: After the response, it checks for any tool calls the LLM decided to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
    *   Adds a message to conversation history indicating a tool call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
    *   Loops through each tool call, extracts its name and arguments, and invokes the corresponding Python function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
    *   Adds the result of the tool invocation as a "tool message" to the conversation history, providing context for the AI's subsequent reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
    *   Recursively calls `prompt_ai` to allow the LLM to continue the conversation or make further tool calls based on the tool's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

#### Streamlit UI Integration
The `main` function sets up the Streamlit application:
*   Displays a title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
*   Initializes messages with the system message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   Rediplays conversation history on UI refresh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
*   Defines a chat input where user prompts are captured, added to the UI and internal state, and then processed by `prompt_ai` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

### Agent Demonstration
To run the agent, navigate to the directory containing the Python scripts and execute `streamlit run main.py` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. The agent can then perform a sequence of tasks:
1.  **Summarize Slack Conversation**: The user asks the agent to summarize a hardcoded Slack conversation. The agent invokes the [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] workflow, retrieves the summary, and presents it in the UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Debug messages show the tool invocation and the response from the [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
2.  **Create Google Doc**: After receiving research findings from the agent, the user asks to create a Google Doc with these findings. The agent calls the [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] workflow, creating a new Google Doc with the research content in the specified Google Drive folder, linking it in the chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
3.  **Send Slack Message**: Finally, the user requests the agent to send a Slack message with the link to the newly created Google Doc. The agent invokes the corresponding [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]] workflow, sending the message to Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

This demonstration highlights how the combined use of [[n8n_in_creating_ai_agents | n8n]], Python, and [[setting_up_ai_agents_with_python_and_langchain | LangChain]] enables easy creation of powerful, controllable AI agents that can interact with external services without direct manual intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

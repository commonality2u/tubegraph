AutodDev, an AI coding assistant forked from Bolt.new, aims to become a robust platform for [[AI agents and their development]] and advanced coding features. The project's vision extends beyond its initial focus on chatting with various Large Language Models (LLMs), including local ones via Ollama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## AI Agent Studio

A key component of the broader "Automator" platform is the [[AI Agent Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[00:20:50]</a>. This studio is designed to be a central place for [[Building AI Agents]] and exploring their capabilities:
*   **Testing and Learning** It will serve as a hub where users can test out different [[AI agents and their development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[00:20:54]</a>. Users will be able to learn how to implement these agents themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[00:20:58]</a>, whether they are developers looking to create agents or business owners seeking to implement them for their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Agent Library** The studio plans to host [[AI agents and their development]] featured on the creator's YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[00:21:11]</a>, allowing users to interact with them and delve deeper into their implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **Collaboration and Open Source** There's a vision for community collaboration and contributions from other content creators to expand the library of available agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[00:21:20]</a>. All agents hosted on the platform are intended to be open source, providing access to their code for learning and modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:05:00">[00:22:05]</a>.
*   **AutodDev as an Agent** AutodDev itself is envisioned to be hosted within the [[AI Agent Studio]], allowing users to try it directly without needing to run it locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[00:21:48]</a>.

## Advanced Development Features for AutodDev

The development roadmap for AutodDev includes several high-priority and long-term goals focused on [[Advanced architecture for AI agents]] and enhancing the development environment:

### High-Priority Features
*   **Local Project Interaction** A crucial feature is the ability to load and interact with local projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[00:35:20]</a>. This includes capabilities like pulling projects from Git repositories or integrating with IDEs such as VS Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:24:00">[00:35:24]</a>. This would greatly enhance the usefulness of AutodDev for existing codebases.
*   **Backend Agent Integration** A significant planned enhancement is to incorporate [[AI agents and their development]] to run in the backend for improved code generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:00">[00:35:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[00:48:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. This could involve multiple agents working together to verify each other's work before generating code for the frontend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:57:00">[00:48:57]</a>.

### Long-Term Goals
*   **Extension Marketplace** A long-term aspiration is to develop an "extension marketplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[00:36:13]</a>. This would allow developers to create and upload extensions for AutodDev without directly modifying the core codebase, providing flexibility for new features like optional backend agent integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:21:00">[00:36:21]</a>.
*   **Optimal System Prompting** Research into [[Advanced architecture for AI agents]] will also involve developing more effective "system prompts" tailored to specific LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:32:00">[00:59:32]</a>. Since different models handle prompts differently, optimizing prompts for various models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen 2.5 Coder, or Deep Seek Coder could significantly improve performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

The development team is actively working on organizing these goals into a roadmap using tools like Roadmap.sh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[00:34:07]</a>, aiming to facilitate contributions and manage tasks for future enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:27:00">[00:34:27]</a>.

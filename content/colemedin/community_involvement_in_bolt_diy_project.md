The [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | Bolt DIY]] project has seen a significant surge in its community and overall project activity since its partnership announcement with Stack Blitz, becoming the official open-source version of Bolt.new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This momentum is crucial for the project to evolve into the best open-source AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Engaging with the Community

The primary hub for community engagement is the Think Tank community at `thinktank.automator.ai` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This platform serves as a space for discussions, idea sharing, and direct contributions to the project.

## Collaborative Roadmap Development

The [[bolt_diys_roadmap_and_future_features | Bolt DIY roadmap]] is a living document, open to change, and collectively shaped by the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Its purpose is to provide a shared vision for the project's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Key foundational elements already completed include:
*   Establishing the core maintainer team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Launching the community platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   Improving documentation and FAQs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Enhancing the repository with CI/CD and issue templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The roadmap is widely accessible via links in the description, the project's README, and documentation, serving as a guiding pillar for the project's progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Financial Incentives for Contributors

The partnership with Bolt.new brings financial incentives for the project, aimed at encouraging contributions to [[introduction_of_bolt_diy_as_the_official_opensource_version_of_bolt_new | Bolt DIY]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This support facilitates initiatives like hosting events with cash prizes to incentivize contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Resources for Contribution and Hosting

To lower the barrier to entry for contributors and users, the maintainer team has developed extensive [[resources_and_tools_for_hosting_and_troubleshooting_bolt_diy | resources and tools for hosting and troubleshooting Bolt DIY]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. These include:
*   Video guides by Dustin on using Bolt DIY, and setting it up on Ubuntu and Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   Simplified documentation in the README for running Bolt DIY with or without Docker across various operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   A comprehensive guide by Michael on deploying Bolt DIY with Cloudflare Pages for self-hosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Key Community Contributions

The project has seen an incredible amount of work from community members, particularly since the Stack Blitz partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Notable contributions include:
*   **Dustin and Anirban**: Praised for their substantial work on pull requests and maintaining the project, especially in developing the new settings model and a debug tab to assist with troubleshooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Anirban (Kodakiss)**: Implemented an optimized experimental prompt system for better results with different LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a> and set up automated releases with a changelog via CI/CD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   **Edward**: Implemented token usage visibility for every prompt, helping users track costs with paid LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **Jonathan**: Added the ability to full-screen and resize the preview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **Ed**: Contributed the functionality to screenshot parts of the preview and send them to the LLM, useful for debugging visual issues and errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

## Contributing to the Project

Community members are strongly encouraged to contribute, either by discussing new feature ideas in the "new feature discussions" subcategory within the Automator Think Tank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a> or, even better, by making a pull request to implement features themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

The ultimate goal is to collectively build the best open-source AI coding assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, inviting anyone interested in joining an "awesome community working on an amazing project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

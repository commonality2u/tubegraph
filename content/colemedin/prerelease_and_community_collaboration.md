The Live Agent Studio, an agent platform by Automator, has officially launched its pre-release phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This platform is designed to be [[community_driven_platform | community-driven]], featuring cutting-edge AI agents that users can try out, learn from, and implement for personal or business use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Introducing Live Agent Studio

The Live Agent Studio is presented as a revolutionary and unique platform that showcases a variety of agents for users to try directly within the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. It is currently in pre-release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

Key features highlighted include:
*   **[[Open Source Development | Open Source]] Nature:** All agents are completely [[Open Source Development | open source]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Community Contributions:** The platform enables the [[Community contributions to software development | community to contribute agents]] to build a comprehensive collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Standardized Agent Creation:** It standardizes agent creation, allowing agents to be built with any platform (e.g., n8n, Pydantic AI, LangChain, Flowise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, provided they follow specific criteria in the developer guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **Full Chat & Conversation History:** Each agent includes full chat and conversation history capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Interactions provide real-time updates on agent processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

The goal is to create a platform where the [[Community and networking through discourse | community]] can learn and build together, keeping pace with the rapid advancements in AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## [[Community Engagement and Contributions]]

The Live Agent Studio emphasizes [[Community engagement in open source projects | community engagement]]. The speaker states that everyone contributing to the agent repository will receive full recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. There are also plans for contributors to monetize their agents in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

*   **Initial Collaborations:** The platform is already [[community_driven_platform | community-driven]] through collaborations. Zubar from AI Workshop contributed a business idea researcher agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>, and Nate, an n8n content creator, contributed a LinkedIn, X, and blog content creator agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.
*   **Agent Compatibility:** Agents can be developed using various platforms like n8n, Pydantic AI with Python, LangChain framework in JavaScript, or Flowise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Adhering to specific criteria in the developer guide allows agents to be quickly integrated into the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Trying out agents
Users receive 100 free tokens to begin trying out agents, acknowledging that a token system is necessary to manage infrastructure, LLM, and API costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

## How to Contribute

Prospective contributors can access a comprehensive developer guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>, which details requirements for agent implementation, including payload and conversation history management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. Sample agents are available on GitHub to provide templates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

Contributors are encouraged to provide URLs (e.g., LinkedIn, X, YouTube) for proper credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>, reinforcing the [[community_driven_platform | community-driven]] and [[Open Source Development | open-source]] ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. The code for all agents is available on GitHub, with a `README` for each to aid in getting started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.

## Automator: The Broader Platform

The Live Agent Studio is part of a larger platform called Automator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Automator aims to be a comprehensive resource, offering tools, networking opportunities, knowledge, and resources for success in the rapidly evolving AI industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. It functions as an extension of the creator's YouTube channel, providing a [[Community and networking through discourse | community]] to learn about local AI agents, get involved with [[bolt_new_fork_introduction_and_its_community_engagement | Bolt.DIY]], and discover the latest AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

The ultimate goal is to equip users with everything needed to succeed with AI, whether for personal use, businesses, agencies, or consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

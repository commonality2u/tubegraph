An upcoming miniseries will demonstrate the entire process for [[building_ai_agents | building AI agents]], including the creation of a full [[ai_agents_for_processing_github_repositories | AI agent designed to consume entire GitHub repositories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Purpose and Functionality
The primary goal of this GitHub agent is to enable users to ask questions about all the code within a repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This functionality is intended to save significant time in understanding a new repository, benefiting both technical and non-technical individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Development and Integration
A live stream event is scheduled for the 28th at 9:00 Central Time, focusing on building a complete prototype for the GitHub agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This prototype will utilize n8n and Gemini 2.0 Flash as the Large Language Model (LLM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Furthermore, the agent will be [[integrating_ai_with_front_ends | integrated with the Automator Live Agent Studio]], providing a comprehensive front-end interface with chat capabilities and conversation history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The agent will also be published there during the live stream for user interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The ongoing miniseries will detail each step of [[building_ai_agents | building the AI agent]], using the GitHub agent as a practical example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

[[Crawl for AI web crawling framework | Crawl for AI]] is an open-source tool designed to crawl websites and format their content for use as knowledge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for [[AI capabilities versus tools | RAG AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The project has gained significant traction, evidenced by its 42,000 stars on GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Core Functionality and Features
[[Crawl for AI web crawling framework | Crawl for AI]] excels at scraping the internet to create knowledge for LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Its primary features include:

*   **Speed** It is described as "blazing fast," effectively and quickly scraping web data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Demonstrations show it scraping entire pages in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **AI-Ready Output** It produces webpage data in markdown format, which is the optimal format for LLMs to understand pages and extract distinct sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This structured markdown includes headings and subheadings, making it highly organized for agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Parallel Processing** [[Crawl for AI web crawling framework | Crawl for AI]] can crawl batches of URLs in parallel, significantly enhancing its speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This capability allows it to process multiple pages simultaneously, such as fetching all URLs from a sitemap in batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

## Installation and Basic Usage
To set up [[Crawl for AI web crawling framework | Crawl for AI]], users need Python installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The installation process is straightforward:
1.  `pip install crawl-for-ai` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
2.  Run a setup command to install the Playwright browser, which allows the terminal to run a browser for scraping under the hood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

A basic example involves creating an instance of an async web crawler and passing a URL to it, such as the Pydantic AI documentation page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The tool then transforms the raw HTML into a structured markdown format that LLMs can better understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Strategies for Scraping Entire Websites
[[Crawl for AI web crawling framework | Crawl for AI]] offers three primary strategies for crawling entire websites, ensuring comprehensive knowledge extraction for LLMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>:

### 1. Sitemap Crawling
Many websites provide a sitemap, typically located at `/sitemap.xml` on the root domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This XML document lists all available URLs for a website, providing a structured way to access all pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. [[Crawl for AI web crawling framework | Crawl for AI]] can take this sitemap, extract all URLs, and then crawl them in parallel batches to obtain markdown from each page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This is generally the most reliable method as it guarantees access to all listed links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

### 2. Recursive Crawling
When a sitemap is not available, [[Crawl for AI web crawling framework | Crawl for AI]] can start from a homepage (or any given URL) and intelligently determine other links within the website through navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This involves recursive scraping, where the tool finds internal links, visits those pages, and continues to discover more links, effectively building a dynamic sitemap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Users can specify a `depth` parameter to control how many levels deep the crawler goes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This method is highly flexible, allowing the crawling of virtually any website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### 3. LLM.ext Crawling
Some frameworks and tools provide a dedicated `.ext` file, usually at `/lms.ext` or `/lms-full.ext` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This file typically combines all documentation pages into a single, comprehensive markdown document specifically formatted for LLM knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. [[Crawl for AI web crawling framework | Crawl for AI]] can simply take this single URL, process the combined document, and then chunk it up for storage in a vector database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This method is very fast because it only needs to pull one page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

## Integration and Applications
[[Crawl for AI web crawling framework | Crawl for AI]] is crucial for building robust RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems. It allows users to:

*   **Ingest Knowledge** Scraped markdown content can be fed into a vector database (e.g., Chroma DB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, Superbase, Quadrant, Pine Cone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>) to create a knowledge base for [[AI capabilities versus tools | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Support AI Agents** It's used in projects like Archon, an [[Creating tools and dependencies for AI agents | AI agent builder]], to ingest documentation and enhance the agent's knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **Assist AI Coding Assistants** Projects like Context 7 leverage [[Crawl for AI web crawling framework | Crawl for AI]] (or similar tools) to constantly scrape up-to-date documentation, providing critical context to AI coding assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

The ability of [[Crawl for AI web crawling framework | Crawl for AI]] to handle diverse website structures and deliver high-quality, AI-ready data makes it an indispensable tool for populating LLM knowledge bases quickly and efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Addressing LLM Limitations

One of the significant [[challenges_of_ai_memory_retention | challenges]] currently faced with large language models (LLMs) is their general and often limited knowledge, especially concerning new information due to training cut-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For instance, an LLM like Claude may not know about newer frameworks such as Pydantic AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Even LLMs capable of searching the web may return very basic information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

However, if comprehensive documentation for a framework like Pydantic AI is placed into a knowledge base for the LLM, the answers received become "spot on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[retrieval_augmented_generation | RAG]] in the current AI landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## What is RAG?

[[retrieval_augmented_generation | RAG]] stands for [[retrieval_augmented_generation | Retrieval Augmented Generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It is a [[retrieval_augmented_generation_rag_methods | method]] designed to provide external, curated knowledge to an LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The primary goal of [[retrieval_augmented_generation | RAG]] is to transform an LLM into an expert on specific subjects it previously lacked knowledge about, such as AI agent frameworks or e-commerce store details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This process effectively helps in [[implementing_long_term_memory_in_ai | implementing long-term memory in AI]].

> [!INFO] Key Benefit
> [[retrieval_augmented_generation | RAG]] allows LLMs to become specialized experts by augmenting their general knowledge with specific, relevant data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## [[introduction_to_retrieval_augmented_generation_rag | Real-world Application: Pydantic AI Example]]

Consider the Pydantic AI framework: without external knowledge, an LLM might not understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. By using [[retrieval_augmented_generation | RAG]], all the framework's documentation can be placed into a knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This allows the LLM to provide accurate and detailed answers about Pydantic AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Tools for [[basics_of_retrieval_augmented_generation_rag | RAG Implementation]]

A significant [[retrieval_augmented_generation_rag_and_its_challenges | challenge]] in [[retrieval_augmented_generation | RAG]] is the curation step, which can be difficult and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. To address this, tools like Crawl for AI have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Crawl for AI
> Crawl for AI is an open-source web crawling framework specifically designed to scrape websites and format the output in a way that is optimal for LLM comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This tool simplifies the process of curating knowledge for [[retrieval_augmented_generation | RAG]] systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Building [[retrieval_augmented_generation_rag_in_ai_agents | RAG AI Agents]]

Using tools like Crawl for AI to curate knowledge, developers can build [[retrieval_augmented_generation_rag_in_ai_agents | RAG AI agents]] that are experts in specific domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For example, an [[retrieval_augmented_generation_rag_in_ai_agents | AI agent]] can be built to be an expert on the Pydantic AI framework by feeding it curated knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This approach is versatile and can be applied to any website or specific knowledge domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

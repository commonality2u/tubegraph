This article details how to build an AI agent designed to streamline the process of converting meeting notes and summaries into actionable tasks. This agent leverages advanced AI capabilities to enhance [[planning_and_task_management_in_ai_development | planning and task management]] and [[improvements_in_project_organization_and_contribution_management | project organization]].

## Overview
The AI agent can search through meeting notes or summaries to identify action items and automatically create tasks based on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It operates via an easy-to-use chatbot interface, significantly saving time by automating the organization of tasks often derived from meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This system is an extension of a previous RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Key Improvements
The current AI agent addresses several limitations of previous RAG implementations, making it more efficient and intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:

### Intelligent Document Retrieval
*   **Problem**: Earlier RAG implementations always searched through documents regardless of the user's prompt, assuming all questions were about documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Solution**: The enhanced AI agent intelligently determines if it needs to search documents or if it can answer the user's question directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Integration with External Tools
*   **Problem**: Previous RAG implementations were standalone and did not interact with other APIs or tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Solution**: This agent integrates with external platforms like [[integration_with_asana_for_project_organization | Asana]] to create tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This allows for [[integrating_ai_agents_with_asana_for_task_creation | AI agents with Asana for task creation]].

### Efficient Vector Database Management
*   **Problem**: The vector database and documents were loaded into memory every time the chatbot ran, which was inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Solution**: The agent now uses a locally stored vector database, eliminating the need to reload documents with each script run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Building the AI Agent

### 1. Creating the Local Vector Database
The first step involves setting up a local vector database to store and retrieve meeting notes efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

*   **Documents**: The vector database is populated with meeting notes, which include both PDF and text documents, typically located in a 'meeting_notes' folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. These are often synthetic notes generated by GPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Packages**: Key packages from LangChain are imported for embedding functions, using Chroma as the vector database, and loading/chunking documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Loading Documents**: A function is defined to load documents from a specified directory using LangChain's directory loader, supporting various formats like PDF, text, HTML, Markdown, and Word documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Chunking**: Documents are split into smaller chunks (e.g., 1,000 characters per chunk) to optimize retrieval and reduce the context passed to the large language model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Database Instantiation**: Chroma is instantiated using an open-source Hugging Face embedding model and saved to a local folder (e.g., 'chroma_DB') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Once created, the AI agent can load this pre-populated database without reloading documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### 2. Implementing RAG into the AI Agent
The next phase involves integrating the RAG capability into the existing [[building_an_ai_agent_for_task_management | AI agent for task management]], specifically the Asana agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

*   **Loading Chroma Instance**: A function is created to load the existing Chroma database instance, using the same embedding model used during document loading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Querying Documents Tool**: A new tool function is defined to query documents using RAG. This tool's docstring guides the large language model on when and how to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
    *   It performs a similarity search with the Chroma instance, returning the top three matching documents based on cosine similarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Integration**: This new document querying tool is added to the agent's mapping of available tools, allowing the AI agent to intelligently decide whether to use its Asana tools or the RAG tool to search documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Demonstration

The agent is accessible via a Streamlit UI in a web browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

1.  **Querying Meeting Notes**: A user can ask a question related to meeting notes, such as details about a wellness program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The AI agent searches the loaded documents and provides the relevant information, like "Emily proposed that we have yoga sessions and Mental Health Resources as a part of the wellness program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This demonstrates the effective functioning of the RAG component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

2.  **Creating Tasks in Asana**: After retrieving information, the user can instruct the AI agent to create tasks in Asana based on that information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. For example, the user can ask to create a new project in Asana called "wellness program" and make "yoga sessions" and "Mental Health Resources" tasks within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   The agent processes this complex request, utilizing the retrieved information from the meeting notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    *   The agent confirms the creation of the "wellness program" project in Asana with the two specified tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
    *   Verification in Asana shows the new project and tasks ("Mental Health Resources" and "yoga sessions") successfully created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Benefits
*   **Time-Saving**: Automates the process of extracting action items and creating tasks, saving significant manual effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Improved Organization**: Reduces the friction of going through meeting notes to pull out action items, leading to better organization and reduced risk of neglecting tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: Keeps individuals more efficient by minimizing the number of missed tasks and enhancing overall [[improvements_in_project_organization_and_contribution_management | project organization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Future Extensions
Future developments will include extending the AI agent to the cloud, allowing documents to be stored in services like Google Drive and the vector database to be hosted remotely, transforming it into a production-ready application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

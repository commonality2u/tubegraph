## Miniseries Overview

The miniseries will walk through the entire process for [[building_ai_agents | building AI agents]], starting with basics and progressing to having an agent in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. As part of this series, a full AI agent capable of consuming entire GitHub repositories will be built, allowing users to ask questions about the code, which is beneficial for both technical and non-technical individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

A live stream is scheduled for the 28th at 9:00 AM Central Time, where a full prototype for the GitHub agent will be built using n8n and Gemini 2.0 Flash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The agent will also be integrated with the Automator Live Agent Studio, providing a full front-end with chat and conversation history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Process for Building AI Agents

The following is a bird's-eye view of the entire process, which will be broken down step-by-step throughout the miniseries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:02">[02:14:02]</a>.

### 1. Planning Your Agent

Planning is crucial to avoid wasting time on incorrect approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>. It's recommended to write out answers to key questions or chat with an LLM about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:04">[02:56:04]</a>.

**Key Planning Questions:**
*   What are the core functionalities desired for the agent? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:04">[03:03:04]</a>
*   Which LLM will be used (e.g., researching local LLMs)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:05">[03:07:05]</a>
*   Which APIs need to be set up in advance? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:05">[03:12:05]</a>
*   What defines a good "V1" (first version) of the agent? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:02">[03:21:02]</a>
    *   Starting with a simpler, proof-of-concept agent is often a good strategy to avoid fatigue from grandiose initial ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:02">[03:31:02]</a>.

### 2. Building a Prototype (No/Low Code)

The next step is to quickly build a powerful prototype using a no-code or low-code tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:04">[03:42:04]</a>.

**Recommended Tools:**
*   n8n <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>
*   Flowise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:03">[03:45:03]</a>
*   Voiceflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:02">[03:46:02]</a> (Sponsor of the video, highly recommended for its `Intents` feature, production readiness, and API for agent interaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:07">[04:21:07]</a>

The goal is to create a working, useful proof of concept that can chat and interact with tools, without focusing on the front end or database yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:07">[03:57:07]</a>. The live stream will demonstrate this step using n8n with Gemini 2.0 Flash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:03">[04:11:03]</a>.

### 3. Setting Up Your Database

A database is essential for chat history, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with a knowledge base, and storing other backend information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:03">[06:42:03]</a>.

**Recommendation:**
*   **Supabase**: Free, uses PostgreSQL, powerful, can be used for RAG, and is the tool used for the Automator Live Agent Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:02">[06:51:02]</a>. Keep table and knowledge base setup simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:06">[07:07:06]</a>.

### 4. Moving Your Agent to Python (Optional)

While no-code/low-code platforms can be sufficient for production, custom coding in Python often provides the desired customization and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:06">[07:24:06]</a>. This step is optional but recommended much of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:03">[07:38:03]</a>.

**Python Frameworks and Tools:**
*   Agent Frameworks: Pydantic AI, LangChain, LangGraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:07">[07:44:07]</a>
*   AI IDEs (to make coding less daunting): Warp, Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:02">[07:57:02]</a>
    *   These tools can help non-technical users transition prototypes from no-code to Python easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:03">[08:04:03]</a>.

### 5. Building a User Interface

Once the agent is built (either in Python or a no-code environment), a clean user interface (UI) is needed for interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:03">[08:16:03]</a>.

**UI Recommendations:**
*   **React Front End:** Using tools like Bolt.DIY or Bolt.new, or Lovable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:04">[08:24:04]</a>.
*   **Streamlit App:** A user-friendly Python UI library designed for LLM interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:02">[08:41:02]</a>. AI IDEs like Warp or Cursor can assist in building Streamlit apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:09">[08:50:09]</a>.
*   **Live Agent Studio:** The speaker's recently released platform, offering a full front-end with chat and conversation history instantly upon integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:05">[09:01:05]</a>.

### 6. Testing Your AI Agent

Testing is a critical, though often less enjoyable, part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:04">[09:27:04]</a>.

*   AI IDEs like Warp or Cursor can help write unit and integration tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:05">[09:35:05]</a>.
*   Thorough testing is vital to cover edge cases, ensure security, and verify accurate information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:01">[09:43:01]</a>. It's crucial before trusting the agent or releasing it to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:01">[09:56:01]</a>.

### 7. Taking Your Agent to Production & Deployment

Once the agent is built, has a UI, and is tested, it's time for deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:07">[10:05:07]</a>.

*   If custom-coding in Python, containerize the agent with Docker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:02">[10:18:02]</a>.
*   For no-code platforms like n8n or Voiceflow, they have their own deployment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:08">[10:24:08]</a>.

**Hosting Recommendations:**
*   **Runpod:** Recommended for hosting agents using local LLMs due to competitive GPU instance pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:06">[10:37:06]</a>.
*   **DigitalOcean:** Recommended for general instances (non-GPU) due to affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:06">[10:43:06]</a>.
*   **API:** Generally, the agent should be behind an API (e.g., built with Fast API if using Python) to allow the front end to interact with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:02">[11:09:02]</a>.

### 8. Setting Up Monitoring

Monitoring can be set up before or after deployment, but usually, it's implemented once the production environment is stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:09">[11:40:09]</a>. It's crucial for watching agents for failures and performance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:09">[11:48:09]</a>.

**Monitoring Tools:**
*   **LangSmith:** Excellent for agents built with LangGraph or LangChain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:09">[11:59:09]</a>.
*   **Langfuse:** An open-source LLM observability platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:08">[12:05:08]</a>.
*   **Logfire:** Fantastic for monitoring agents using Pydantic AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:02">[12:12:02]</a>.

### 9. Agent Evaluation

Agent evaluation is distinct from testing and more advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:01">[12:25:01]</a>.
*   **Testing** ensures the agent doesn't encounter errors (e.g., application crashing, LLM unable to process requests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:09">[12:35:09]</a>.
*   **Evaluation** ensures the agent provides *correct responses* and takes *correct actions* for given inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:04">[12:47:04]</a>.

### 10. Advanced Topics / Enterprise-Grade Agents

These are advanced concepts not covered in detail in the miniseries but are important for [[building_productiongrade_ai_agents | building production-grade AI agents]] and enterprise-level solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:04">[13:18:04]</a>.

**Advanced Considerations:**
*   **Cost Optimization:** Prompt caching, managing token window, batching requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:01">[13:23:01]</a>.
*   **Load Balancing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:05">[13:29:05]</a>.
*   **Security & Data Privacy Best Practices:** Rate limiting, input sanitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:08">[13:30:08]</a>.

These areas demonstrate the continuous improvement opportunities for agents to become more robust and enterprise-ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:04">[13:47:04]</a>.

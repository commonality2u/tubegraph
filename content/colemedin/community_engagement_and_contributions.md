The Autod Dev project, a fork of Bolt.new aiming to be the best open-source AI coding assistant, has seen a significant increase in [[community_engagement_in_open_source_projects | community engagement]] and contributions following the official launch of its community in the Automator Think Tank. A celebratory live stream further boosted the project's visibility and involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Impact of Community Contributions

Since the community launch, there has been a big uptick in the engagement on the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Many individuals are making significant additions to Autod Dev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, and the core team of maintainers has stepped up considerably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Specific contributions highlighted include:
*   **Tommy**: Ensured the provider choice in the UI is consistently used in the backend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Muutin**: Added support for Groq, the latest Sonet, and Haiku models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Patrick**: Implemented configuration within Autod Dev to simplify the process of using various AMA models, eliminating the need for separate model file creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **The Codus**: Made significant improvements, including code streaming, which allows users to see the large language model type out code as it's generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. He also added a Bolt terminal attached to the workbench, providing visibility into command outputs, which is crucial for debugging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Aaron**: Contributed to containerization efforts and repository cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Janen**: Added a missing flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Ally**: Performed important bug fixes after other features were merged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Edward**: Standardized model provider code, allowing Autod Dev to automatically fetch all available models from providers like OpenRouter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. He also added a button linking users directly to obtain API keys or download pages for providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Chris**: Played a crucial role behind the scenes, merging contributions, coordinating efforts, and managing PR and bug tags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

These [[community_contributions_to_software_development | community contributions to software development]] are highly valued and respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Community-Driven Roadmap and Vision

An initial roadmap for Autod Dev has been shared, created using Road map.sh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This roadmap is a "rough draft," as the community is still actively in the planning phase, collectively deciding the direction of Autod Dev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The emphasis is on developing a strong vision to prevent the project from becoming a collection of random features and ultimately dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Key aspects of the community-driven roadmap include:
*   **Crowdfunding**: Exploring options like Kickstarter to fund features and pay developers through bounties, ensuring rapid project progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The community's desire for donation options was expressed during a live stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **High-Priority Features**: Addressing issues like preventing Bolt from constantly rewriting files, improving prompting for smaller LLMs, and implementing the highly requested feature of loading local projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Extension Marketplace**: A major future goal is an extension marketplace that allows developers to create plugins for Autod Dev without needing to update the core repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This will prevent feature bloat and allow users to toggle on/off desired functionalities in the UI, ensuring a clean and scalable platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

The roadmap is expected to be updated frequently, demonstrating the community and core maintainers' commitment to a clear vision and scalable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Community Support and Troubleshooting

The project encourages [[community_and_networking_through_discourse | community and networking through Discourse]] for troubleshooting and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Users are encouraged to share error messages in the community, specifically in the "Think Tank" or YouTube comments, to receive better help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. A pinned comment in the issues and troubleshooting category of the community offers guidance on how to fix common errors or provide sufficient information for others to assist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

The project is continually being built "together as a community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

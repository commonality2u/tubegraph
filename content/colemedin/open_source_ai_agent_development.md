The Live Agent Studio has been launched as a pre-release platform designed to foster [[opensource_ai_coding_assistant_development | open-source AI agent development]] and community collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. It is described as a revolutionary and one-of-a-kind platform within the [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agent]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.

## The Live Agent Studio

The Live Agent Studio is a [[communitydriven_ai_agents | community-driven]] platform offering cutting-edge agents that users can try out and learn to implement for themselves or their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Its primary goal is to provide a unique platform where users can:
*   Try out agents directly in the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.
*   Access all agents as completely open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   Contribute agents to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.
*   Build agents using [[frameworks_and_tools_for_ai_agent_development | any platform]] by adhering to a standardized approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>.
*   Benefit from full chat and conversation history for every agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

The platform ensures that contributors receive recognition for their contributions to the repository of agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. There are also plans to enable future monetization of contributed agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

### Community and Contribution
The Live Agent Studio emphasizes a [[communitydriven_ai_agents | community-driven]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. It serves as a place for the community to learn and build together, helping to keep pace with the rapid advancements in AI, especially [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

To facilitate contributions, a comprehensive developer guide provides detailed information on how to implement agents compatible with the studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This includes specific requirements for agent payloads and conversation history management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. Sample agents are available on GitHub to serve as templates for new contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

When submitting an agent, contributors are encouraged to provide a URL for credit, such as their LinkedIn, X, or YouTube channel, ensuring proper attribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. All code is available to view on GitHub, with a README for each agent to help users get started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

### Supported Frameworks and Tools
The Live Agent Studio is designed to be compatible with agents built using various [[frameworks_and_tools_for_ai_agent_development | development platforms]] and frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This includes:
*   n8n <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>
*   Pydantic AI with Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>
*   LangChain framework in JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>
*   Flowise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>

## Automator: The Broader Platform

The Live Agent Studio is a component of a larger platform called Automator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:50">[03:40:50]</a>. Automator aims to be a comprehensive resource providing tools, networking opportunities, knowledge, and resources for success in the rapidly evolving AI industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. It serves as an extension of the YouTube channel, offering a community for learning about local agents, contributing to Bolt.DIY, trying out agents, and discovering the latest AI tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## Examples of Agents

Initially, the platform features nine agents, with contributions from other content creators:
*   **Business Idea Researcher Agent:** Developed in collaboration with Zubar from AI Workshop, this agent scours small business forums to find problems and generate business ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. It is an n8n workflow using Claude 3.5 Haiku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.
*   **LinkedIn, X, and Blog Content Creator Agent:** Created with Nate, another n8n content creator, this agent generates content for various platforms based on a target audience and topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. It is built with n8n and provides real-time updates during content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   **Pydantic AI Web Researcher Agent:** Developed by the platform creator, this advanced web research agent searches the web and summarizes articles before providing answers. It uses Pydantic AI, a Python framework, and Claude 3.5 Haiku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. It provides real-time updates on its search progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

These examples demonstrate the platform's ability to host agents built with different [[frameworks_and_tools_for_ai_agent_development | tools]] while offering an interactive experience with features like chat history and real-time updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

## Future Vision

The Live Agent Studio is part of a larger [[opensource_ai_coding_assistants_and_community_building | open source community]] being built around Bolt.DIY, local AI agents, and n8n <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. The mission includes [[building_productiongrade_ai_agents | building production-grade AI agents]] and empowering users to be the best AI content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The studio will integrate future YouTube channel agent builds, making them immediately available for users to try out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

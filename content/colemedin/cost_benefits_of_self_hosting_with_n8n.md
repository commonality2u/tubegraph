[[workflow_automation_with_n8n | n8n]] is a powerful [[overview_of_n8n_as_a_workflow_automation_tool | workflow automation tool]] that distinguishes itself from competitors like [[workflow_automation_with_n8n_compared_to_other_tools | make.com]] or [[workflow_automation_with_n8n_compared_to_other_tools | Zapier]] primarily due to its self-hosting capability, which offers significant cost benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Zero Execution Costs
One of the primary advantages of self-hosting [[overview_of_n8n_as_a_workflow_automation_tool | n8n]] is that users pay "a grand total of 0 to run your workflow executions with [[workflow_automation_with_n8n | n8n]] no matter how many you have per month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This contrasts sharply with other services that often charge based on the number of workflow executions.

## Significant Savings Compared to Alternatives
The cost savings can be substantial. For example, a user previously paid $174 a month for [[workflow_automation_with_n8n_compared_to_other_tools | Zapier]] while their business still had room to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. By switching to self-hosting [[workflow_automation_with_n8n | n8n]], this can save thousands of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Minimal Hosting Expense
The only cost associated with self-hosting [[workflow_automation_with_n8n | n8n]] is for the cloud machine used to host the instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This can be as inexpensive as $6 per month if using a service like DigitalOcean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. DigitalOcean is a recommended service for cloud compute that provides sufficient power to run [[workflow_automation_with_n8n | n8n]] at this low price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

The affordability of [[overview_of_n8n_as_a_workflow_automation_tool | n8n]], regardless of scaling, makes it a favored feature, alongside its direct integration with LangChain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Comprehensive documentation is available to guide users through the self-hosting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

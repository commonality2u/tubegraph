The advancement of genomic prediction and the potential for genetic selection and editing raise significant and complex ethical questions. These discussions often involve historical context, concerns about social equity, the nature of scientific inquiry, and the future trajectory of human society.

## Historical Context and Shifting Views

The societal perspective on practices resembling genetic selection has evolved considerably.

### Early 20th Century Progressives and Eugenics
In the early 20th century, many figures considered progressive at the time, such as Margaret Sanger, were proponents of what would today be termed eugenics [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]]. These individuals, seen as forebears of some modern progressive movements, believed that thanks to Darwinian insights, society should take steps to ensure its health, including in reproduction.

### Modern Opposition and "Wokeism"
Conversely, many contemporary individuals, particularly those described as "wokeist," express strong opposition to these technologies and research areas. This represents a significant flip in perspective among some progressive circles compared to their early 20th-century counterparts. The definition of what is considered "left" or "progressive" can change significantly over time, as exemplified by historical stances on issues like prohibition [[impact_of_culture_and_environment_on_intelligence | impact of culture and environment on intelligence]].

### International Perspectives
Different cultures may hold varying views. For instance, in China, the term for eugenics is reportedly viewed positively, translating to concepts like "healthy production". This perspective is noted even among those who identify as communists in China [[the_impact_of_mao_zedongs_policies_on_chinese_society | the impact of Mao Zedong's policies on Chinese society]].

## Concerns about Inequality and Social Stratification

A primary ethical concern is the potential for genetic selection technologies to exacerbate social inequalities.

### Access and the "Billionaire Effect"
There's apprehension that if significant enhancements (e.g., greatly extended healthy lifespans) become possible, they might initially only be accessible to the ultra-wealthy, such as billionaires [[meritocracy_and_the_role_of_billionaires_in_entrepreneurship | meritocracy and the role of billionaires in entrepreneurship]]. This could lead to a scenario where, for example, the grandchildren of prominent figures are predicted to live extraordinarily long lives, causing public anger and protests.

### Potential for Societal Divergence
A significant fear is the creation of a "Morlocks and Eloi" type of society, where genetic enhancements lead to a runaway divergence between different segments of the population [[the_future_impact_of_genetic_engineering_on_society | the future impact of genetic engineering on society]]. This technology could potentially counteract natural regression to the mean, allowing elites to maintain and amplify advantages across generations. This is acknowledged as a fair concern and a risk of grotesque inequality. However, it's also pointed out that significant inequalities already exist in society, for example, in access to basic healthcare in wealthy nations.

## Fear of "Dangerous Knowledge" and Suppression of Research

The potential for genetic research to uncover uncomfortable truths about human differences leads to anxieties and, in some cases, attempts to suppress inquiry.

### Research on Group Differences
There is a worry that research could definitively show average differences in certain traits between ancestral populations, which might become taboo or have negative social consequences. Examples include potential differences in height (e.g., Nordics vs. Italians) or even behavioral traits like extraversion between populations (e.g., Japan vs. Sicily), which could cause people to "freak out" [[human_genetic_and_cultural_adaptations | human genetic and cultural adaptations]]. Some individuals who understand the implications of this research are reportedly so alarmed that they attempt to suppress it.

### Lagging Research in Sensitive Areas
Research into the genetic basis of traits like intelligence is particularly fraught and is described as lagging due to "crazy wokeism and fear of crazy wokeists". Despite valid medical reasons to study cognitive ability (e.g., in aging and dementia research), researchers are often afraid to collect this data due to its controversial social implications [[scientific_research_and_the_role_of_institutions_like_nih_and_fast_grants | scientific research and the role of institutions like NIH and Fast Grants]].

## Societal Benefits vs. Risks

The debate also weighs the potential positive outcomes against the potential harms.

### Reducing Disease Burden and Enhancing Health
Proponents argue that the goals of achieving healthier populations, potentially with significantly longer lifespans (e.g., 200 years), are inherently progressive. This technology could also be a tool to address existing inequalities by providing families with resources to improve health outcomes for the next generation [[advancements_in_genomics_and_ai | advancements in genomics and AI]].

### Loss of Genetic Diversity
A counter-concern is that widespread genetic engineering for specific desirable traits (e.g., "blonde and 6'4") could reduce overall human genetic diversity, making the population more susceptible to diseases. However, it's suggested that a "natural reservoir of the wild type" with greater genetic diversity would likely persist, especially if IVF and selection are used by a minority (e.g., 10-20%) of the population [[demographic_trends_and_fertility_technology | demographic trends and fertility technology]]. The argument about evolutionary diversity loss is sometimes suspected to be a "front" for deeper moral reservations about the technology itself.

## Regulation and Adoption

The practicalities of regulating such technologies and the patterns of their adoption are also ethically relevant.

### Difficulty in Regulation
Given that the core of advanced genomic analysis and selection advice can be reduced to "bits" of information, effective regulation may be challenging. Data could potentially be uploaded from one country to a vendor in another, less restrictive jurisdiction, which then returns a report [[geopolitical_implications_on_technology_and_data_centers | geopolitical implications on technology and data centers]]. This makes it hard to enforce bans if the technology is merely software-based analysis.

### Adoption and National Policies
The rate and manner of adoption are uncertain. Some, like commentator Gwern, express pessimism about widespread uptake due to public hostility, the complexities of advanced family planning, financial costs, and the physically demanding nature of IVF.
Societal responses could vary: some countries might ban the technology, while others might integrate it into national healthcare systems, potentially offering it for free [[the_role_and_future_of_microsoft_in_the_context_of_global_technological_advancements | the role and future of Microsoft in the context of global technological advancements]]. Government intervention could even be used to redistribute access to these technologies, for example, by allowing more aggressive edits or more embryos for below-average families to mitigate inequality. Countries like Denmark and Israel already cover IVF in their national health systems and are aggressive with genetic testing [[china_and_the_uss_race_in_ai_and_superintelligence | China and the US's race in AI and superintelligence]].

In conclusion, the ethical landscape surrounding genetic selection is multifaceted, involving deeply held beliefs about human nature, equality, and the role of science in society. The trajectory of these technologies will likely be shaped by ongoing debate across these ethical dimensions [[ethical_considerations_and_deployment_of_ai | ethical considerations and deployment of AI]].

CCTV footage analysis is a system designed to automatically pinpoint critical security events from hours of surveillance footage, converting them into actionable insights and detailed reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a>. This solution addresses the challenge of unnoticed events in extensive video recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03"></a>.

## Core Technology and Functionality

The system leverages [[twelve_labs_video_embedding_and_retrieval | Twelve Labs]] for video analysis and detailed reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21"></a>. It also integrates [[pegasus_11_video_analytics | Pegasus 1.1]] for generating comprehensive incident reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34"></a>.

### Process Overview
The analysis process involves:
1.  **Video Embedding**: Collecting and embedding varied video footages, such as car accidents, street fights, and paranormal activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24"></a>.
2.  **Search and Pinpointing**: Instead of watching entire videos, users can search for specific events, instantly finding crucial moments with the help of [[twelve_labs_video_embedding_and_retrieval | Twelve Labs]]' API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42"></a>.
    *   Search results include a confidence score (e.g., whether it's high) and specific time stamps where the incident occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07"></a>.
3.  **Detailed Analysis and Reporting**: Utilizing [[pegasus_11_video_analytics | Pegasus 1.1]], the system analyzes the video to provide exact reports describing what happened, why it happened, and details about the surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34"></a>.
    *   These reports can be viewed and downloaded, containing information like priority level, generated date, and analysis type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06"></a>.

### Example Demonstrations
*   **Car Accident Search**: A search for "car accident on Highway section" quickly yields results with high confidence scores, showing videos related to roads, cars, and dash cams, along with time stamps indicating the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57"></a>. The detailed analysis might describe events like a truck causing a minor traffic jam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48"></a>.
*   **Paranormal Activity Identification**: Searching for "Paranormal Activity identified" can show videos of dark rooms or roads associated with abnormal activities, providing detailed analysis of static environments, unoccupied spaces, and sounds like loud bangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29"></a>.

## Technical Implementation Details

The application is built as a Flask app, with its frontend comprising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12"></a>. It can be deployed on platforms like Render <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19"></a>. The code is available as a Replit file, allowing users to fork it and start working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02"></a>.

### Adding Video Footages
There are two primary methods to add videos to the system for searching:
1.  **[[twelve_labs_video_embedding_and_retrieval | Twelve Labs]] Playground**: Generate an API key, create an index with [[pegasus_11_video_analytics | Pegasus 1.1]], and upload videos directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26"></a>.
2.  **AWS S3 Bucket Integration**: For large volumes of video footages, directly integrate with [[twelve_labs_video_embedding_and_retrieval | Twelve Labs]]' AWS S3 integration by connecting an index ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35"></a>.

### Key API Calls
*   **Stage 1: Search**: The `client.search` function is used for the initial search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41"></a>. It requires an index ID (containing indexed video footages) and a query text (e.g., "car accident on highway") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45"></a>. The results include video ID, score, confidence, start and end clip time stamps, and video URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07"></a>.
*   **Stage 2: Report Generation**: For detailed analytics and report generation, `client.generate.text` is used with [[pegasus_11_video_analytics | Pegasus 1.1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54"></a>. This function takes the video ID and an open-ended prompt (e.g., "provide a detailed analysis of the key events") to generate comprehensive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07"></a>.
*   **PDF Generation**: A `report_generator.py` module, utilizing ReportLab, handles the creation of PDF reports from the analysis text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56"></a>.

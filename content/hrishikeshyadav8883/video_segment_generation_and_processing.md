Video segment generation and processing addresses the significant challenge content creators and YouTubers face when manually noting video timestamps to create proper highlights or chapters, a task that consumes considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The YouTube Chapter Timestamp Generator

This application helps users build a YouTube chapter timestamp generator with the aid of [[Twelve Labs video embedding and retrieval | Twelve Labs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It offers two main options: uploading a new video or selecting an existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Core Functionality

The generator aims to provide snippets in a format suitable for direct copying and pasting into YouTube video descriptions, making all highlights visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It also provides segmented video clips, simplifying the upload process for content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

For already uploaded videos via the application, users can regenerate timestamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Technical Architecture and Process

The entire application is built on Streamlit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Key components include:

*   **File Management**: Uses `tempfile` for handling file management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **SDK Integration**: Imports the [[Twelve Labs video embedding and retrieval | Twelve Labs]] SDK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Utility Functions**: Contains `util` functions that encapsulate the application's operations and functionalities, such as fetching existing videos, generating timestamps, and creating video segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Session State**: An important feature that remembers the timestamp, video ID, and video URL across sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

#### Video Processing Stages

1.  **Video Indexing**: When a video is processed, its [[video_indexing_and_processing | indexing]] begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This involves generating embeddings using Mango 2.6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  **Analysis**: After embedding generation, the results are analyzed with Pegasus 1.1 to obtain structured snippets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
3.  **Segment Cutting**: Once a video is indexed, segments are cut from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   The URL of the embedded video, typically in M3U8 format, is retrieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    *   These segments are then converted to MP4 format for easier sharing across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   The `movie.editor` Python library is utilized for handling timestamp and segment cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
4.  **Timestamp Generation**: The `generate_timestamp` function uses `client.generate_summarize` with the `type` parameter set to `'chapter'` to create video chapters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The output, initially in seconds, is converted to the minute:second format required for YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
5.  **Video Download**: `YT DLP` is used to download videos from a URL, enabling segment creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
6.  **Long Video Handling**: For videos longer than 30 minutes (e.g., podcasts), a trimming process is applied where the video is cut into 30-minute chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The end timestamp of one segment becomes the start timestamp for the next to ensure complete timestamp generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

#### Environment Variables and Setup

Crucially, users need an API key and index ID as environment variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. These can be generated from the [[Twelve Labs video embedding and retrieval | Twelve Labs]] playground by selecting the Mango 2.6 and Pegasus 1.1 engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. All embedded or indexed videos will reside within this specified index ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Usage and Demonstration

The application allows users to upload video files and select their type (e.g., less than 30 minutes or more than 30 minutes for podcasts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Once processed, the generated timestamp format can be easily copied and pasted into the YouTube description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, instantly displaying the video's chapters and highlights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Users can access a Replit link to interact with the code and run it live for hands-on experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

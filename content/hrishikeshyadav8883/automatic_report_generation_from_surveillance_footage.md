Automatic report generation from surveillance footage provides a solution to the challenge of identifying critical security events in vast amounts of surveillance data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This system allows users to instantly pinpoint exact moments from footage and convert them into actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## System Overview

The system, built with [[using_twelve_labs_for_video_indexing | Twelve Labs]], performs [[cctv_footage_analysis | CCTV footage analysis]] and detailed reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It addresses the need to quickly find crucial moments, such as accidents or emergencies, without manually watching entire videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Core Functionality

The process involves several stages, leveraging AI models for efficient [[video_indexing_and_processing | video indexing and processing]] and analysis:

### 1. Video Ingestion and Indexing

Video footages, including varied content like car accidents, street fights, and paranormal activity, are collected and embedded into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

There are two primary methods for adding videos:
*   **Twelve Labs Playground**: Users can generate an API key, create an index using [[pegasus_11_video_analytics | Pegasus 1.1]], and upload videos directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **AWS S3 Bucket Integration**: For large volumes of footage stored in AWS S3, direct integration with [[using_twelve_labs_for_video_indexing | Twelve Labs]] is possible by connecting an index ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

Once indexed, the API key and index ID are used for further operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### 2. Event Search and Retrieval

Users can search for specific events using natural language queries, such as "car accident on Highway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The [[using_twelve_labs_for_video_indexing | Twelve Labs]] search API processes this query against the indexed video footages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Search results provide:
*   Video ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
*   Confidence score (e.g., high confidence if > 0.7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
*   Start and end timestamps of the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
*   Video URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>

This stage is crucial for [[video_segment_generation_and_processing | video segment generation and processing]], identifying relevant clips without manual review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### 3. Detailed Incident Analysis

After identifying relevant video segments, the system proceeds to generate a detailed analysis of what happened and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This is achieved using [[pegasus_11_video_analytics | Pegasus 1.1]] through an open-ended prompt that requests a detailed analysis of key events, actions, and notable elements in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

For example, for a car accident, it might describe a truck carrying construction material causing a minor traffic jam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. For paranormal activity, it could explain details about a static environment, unoccupied spaces, or loud bangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### 4. Automated Report Generation

The final stage involves generating a professional PDF report from the detailed analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This report includes information like priority level, generation date, and analysis type, providing comprehensive documentation of the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The report generation is handled by a backend component, using libraries like ReportLab for formatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Use Cases

This system has broad applications, extending beyond basic surveillance:
*   **Surveillance Operator Support**: Assisting operators in quickly identifying and understanding critical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Security Analytics**: Providing deeper insights into security incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Private Security**: Enhancing the capabilities of private security services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Automated Documentation and Report Generation**: Streamlining the creation of incident reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Traffic Surveillance and Management**: Analyzing traffic flow and identifying incidents for better management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

The underlying technology can also be applied to broader [[building_video_classification_applications | video classification applications]] where video intelligence is required to understand human or more-than-human actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Implementation

The system is implemented as a Flask application, with front-end components in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. It can be forked and run directly from Replit, or deployed on platforms like Render <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Detailed instructions and the GitHub repository are available for local setup and further exploration of use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

HealthX is an innovative AI-powered healthcare platform aiming to revolutionize the healthcare sector through automation and [[predictive_diagnostics_in_healthcare|predictive diagnostics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The project focuses on leveraging AI and advanced Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) device integration to provide a holistic AI approach to healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Problems Identified in Healthcare

Several key issues in the healthcare sector are addressed by HealthX:
*   **Rising Costs** Healthcare expenditures are significant, leading to an unsustainable financial burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Lack of [[healthcare_personalization|Personalization]]** There is a need for more tailored healthcare solutions based on individual health data to enable data-driven decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Doctor Shortages** Particularly in countries like India, there's a shortage of doctors and inadequate medical facilities in rural and remote areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This highlights a need for a platform to coordinate doctors and patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Reactive Treatment Model** The current model is often reactive, especially for critical diseases like heart disease and lung cancer, necessitating a shift towards preventive measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## HealthX Mission and Vision

The core mission of HealthX is to revolutionize healthcare by assisting both doctors and patients in understanding health conditions and taking correct preventive measures or actions through AI and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

The business model for HealthX focuses on:
*   Subscription-based services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   [[virtual_doctor_consultations|Virtual doctor consultations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Healthcare provider partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Platform Portals

### Doctor's Portal
The doctor's portal displays total patient records, categorized by male and female, and allows doctors to log in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Doctors can manage patient statuses (e.g., updating a patient's status to "process") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. They can view patient profiles, where data is seamlessly generated and collected from [[iot_integration_in_medical_solutions|IoT devices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Doctors can also input new data for predictions and have conversations with patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Patient Dashboard
From the patient dashboard, users can converse with their doctor and utilize AI to predict or analyze their health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The system uses a Gen AI model that evaluates medical knowledge and provided data. Although limited [[iot_integration_in_medical_solutions|IoT]] data might result in general recommendations, it can still advise on investigations, scheduling appointments (e.g., with a cardiologist), and addressing issues like high cholesterol or blood pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

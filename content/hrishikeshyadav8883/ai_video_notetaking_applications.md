[[AI video notetaking applications | AI video notetaking applications]] leverage artificial intelligence to help users extract information and create notes from video content. These applications are often powered by platforms like [[Twelve Labs video embedding and retrieval | Twelve Labs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, exploring various [[use_cases_for_video_understanding | use cases for video understanding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> and enabling rapid solution development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Application Overview

A typical [[AI video notetaking applications | AI video notetaking application]] is built using frameworks like Streamlit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Its core functionality includes:

*   **Adding New Notes** Users can add new notes by providing the URL of a YouTube or any other video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Searching and Filtering Notes** Existing notes can be searched by keywords, such as "intro" or "horror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The application also supports filtering by tags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Summarization** The application can summarize the main points of a video based on user prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Scene-by-Scene Description** For visual content, the application can describe what is happening in the frame every two to three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Editing and Deletion** Notes can be edited or deleted as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

> [!info] Session State
> The application uses session state to save notes in the cache for demonstration purposes, though a database could be connected for persistent storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Core Technology and Process

The application utilizes [[Twelve Labs video embedding and retrieval | Twelve Labs]]' engines to process videos and generate notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>:

*   **Marango 2.6 Engine** Used for embedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Pegasus 1.1 Engine** Used for the generative part, handling visual and conversational understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

The [[technical_process_of_video_notetaking_app | technical process of video notetaking app]] for generating a note involves several steps:

1.  **URL Validation** The application first checks if the provided YouTube URL is valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
2.  **Video Processing Status** The status of video processing is checked at 5-second intervals, transitioning from "pending" to "indexing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
3.  **Indexing Success** Once the video is successfully indexed, its status changes to "ready" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The `task.ID` is crucial for retrieving the video ID, which allows for conversational interaction with the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
4.  **Note Generation** After indexing, the system proceeds to generate the text notes based on the user's prompt (e.g., "summarize the main points of this video") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

> [!example] Output Example
> A generated note might describe a video as "a mass speaking POS patiently in a Garden setting he is describing a variety of topics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## Use Cases for Video Understanding

These applications go beyond simple video transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, offering deeper understanding of video frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. They are particularly useful for:

*   **Lecture Videos** Especially those without spoken content, relying instead on slides, text, graphs, or plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Custom Applications** Users can build their own specific [[use_cases_for_video_understanding | use cases]] around the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Twelve Labs Dashboard Integration

Users can also monitor and interact with their indexed videos directly through the [[Twelve Labs video embedding and retrieval | Twelve Labs]] dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The dashboard allows viewing video configurations, understanding engine settings (like Pegasus 1.1), and performing actions such as searching, classifying, or generating content (summaries, highlights, chapters) from the indexed video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This provides a platform for experimentation before building a full application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

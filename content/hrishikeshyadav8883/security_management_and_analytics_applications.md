[[security_event_detection_with_twelve_labs | Critical security events]] in hours of surveillance footage can often go unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. A surveillance analysis system aims to instantly pinpoint exact moments from footage and convert them into actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This system performs CCTV footage analysis and detailed reporting with the help of [[TwelveLabs platform and capabilities | Twelve Labs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Core Functionality

The system allows users to search for specific events within varied video footages, such as car accidents, street fights, or paranormal activity, rather than watching entire videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Instant Search**: Users can search for specific events like "car accident on Highway section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Confidence Scoring**: Search results display a confidence score indicating the likelihood of the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. A confidence score greater than 0.7 is classified as "high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **Timestamp Identification**: The system highlights the particular time segments within the video where the incident occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Visual Search Options**: The search function utilizes visual options, providing video IDs, scores, confidence levels, and start/end clip timestamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

For example, searching for "Paranormal Activity identified" might display videos of dark, unoccupied rooms or roads where abnormal activities might occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Detailed Analysis and Reporting

After identifying an event, the system can generate a detailed analysis and report using [[Pegasus 11 video analytics | Pegasus 1.1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This stage provides a proper report of what is happening and why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

*   **Incident Description**: It describes the incident, explaining what happened, the problem, and understanding about the surrounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. For instance, a truck carrying construction material causing a minor traffic jam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Open-ended Prompt Analysis**: It uses `client.generate.text` with an open-ended prompt (e.g., "provide a detailed analysis of the key events, actions, and notable elements in this video") to generate the report based on the video ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Report Download**: The generated report can be downloaded as a PDF, including details like priority level, generated date, and analysis type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This [[automatic_report_generation_from_surveillance_footage | report generation]] utilizes a backend `report_generator.py` file, leveraging the `reportlab` library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Implementation and Development

The application is built using a Flask app, with front-end components in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The showcased app is deployed on Render <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Adding Videos for Analysis
There are two primary methods to add videos for [[video_indexing_and_processing | indexing]] and searching:
1.  **Twelve Labs Playground**: Generate an API key, [[creating_and_managing_indexes_on_twelve_labs_platform | create an index]] with [[Pegasus 11 video analytics | Pegasus 1.1]], and upload videos directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
2.  **AWS S3 Integration**: For large volumes of footage, integrate directly with Twelve Labs from an AWS S3 bucket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Once an index is ready, the index ID and API key are used to initialize the Twelve Labs client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Code Structure
*   **Search Function**: The main search function takes an `index_id` (containing indexed video footages) and a `query_text` (e.g., "car accident on the highway") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Report Generation**: For detailed reports, `client.generate.text` is used with [[Pegasus 11 video analytics | Pegasus 1.1]] to provide open-ended prompts based on a specific video ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **PDF Generation**: A `report_generator.py` module handles the conversion of the analysis text into a PDF report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

The process of [[building_video_classification_applications | building this application]] with [[TwelveLabs platform and capabilities | Twelve Labs]] is designed to be straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Use Cases

Beyond the showcased demo, this type of system can be applied to various scenarios:
*   Surveillance operator and security analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>
*   Private security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   [[Automatic report generation from surveillance footage | Automated documentation and report generation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   Traffic surveillance and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>

This tool can be utilized for any application requiring video intelligence to understand events at a human or superhuman level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

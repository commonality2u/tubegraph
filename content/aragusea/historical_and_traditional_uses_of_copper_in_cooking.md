Copper has been utilized in cooking and food preparation for centuries due to its unique physical and chemical properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Its beauty is an obvious draw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, but its functional advantages have cemented its place in culinary traditions.

## Properties of Copper Cookware
[[benefits_and_characteristics_of_copper_cookware | Copper]] is renowned as an incredible heat conductor, surpassed only by diamond and silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. It heats very evenly, preventing hot spots that could burn or seize ingredients, especially important in sugar work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This high thermal conductivity allows for quick heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> and cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. It is 25 times more thermally conductive than stainless steel and almost twice as conductive as aluminum, enabling thinner layers of copper to achieve desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This is why many high-quality stainless steel cookware pieces feature layers of copper sandwiched inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

Historically, copper was the first metal widely used by humans, often found in its pure elemental form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. It doesn't require high heat for shaping and can be worked cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. It is highly malleable and ductile, meaning it can be easily formed into shapes using a hammer or drawn into thin wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Specific Traditional Applications

### Beating Egg Whites
In classical European cooking, a raw, unlined copper bowl is the traditional choice for beating egg whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. [[copper_cookware_and_chemical_reactivity | Copper]] is very chemically reactive, which is a desirable property in this application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

When egg whites are beaten, the goal is to unfold and tangle egg proteins to create a web that traps water and air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. If over-beaten, proteins can tighten, releasing water and air, causing the foam to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Using copper bowls or utensils introduces copper ions, which form complexes with an egg protein called ovotransferrin (or conalbumin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. According to Harold McGee, these complexes make the foam more stable during beating and cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Other research suggests copper ions may bond with sulfur groups on egg proteins, preventing strong disulfide bonds that can make the foam brittle and prone to breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Experiments show that using a copper bowl can achieve stiff peaks in egg whites in 90 seconds, compared to 120 seconds in a stainless steel bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The foam produced in a copper bowl is also more stable, leaking significantly less water after 30 minutes compared to foam whipped in steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For those without a copper bowl, a pinch of cream of tartar or a squeeze of lemon juice can achieve a similar stabilizing effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Alcohol Distillation
[[use_of_copper_in_alcohol_distillation | Copper]]'s affinity for sulfur is also a key reason for its use in alcohol distillation vessels, such as traditional pot stills and modern column stills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

As distiller Justin Huey explains, copper pulls sulfur out of the distillate when it is in vapor form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This is particularly beneficial when distilling brandies, which are extracted from wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Wine contains sulfur compounds that would otherwise vaporize with the alcohol and end up in the brandy, imparting an undesirable "rotten eggs" taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Even low amounts of sulfur are detectable due to the low pH of spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Copper bonds with this sulfur, effectively removing it from the distillate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Early distillers may not have known this chemical benefit, but they appreciated copper's excellent heat conductivity and ease of workability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Jam and Candy Making
Pure copper pots, known as jam pans, are commonly used for making sweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. It is believed that the high sugar content in solutions inhibits copper from leaching into the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The French have traditionally made jam in pure copper pots for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

A common belief is that jam should be cooked very quickly to avoid driving off volatile fruity aromas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Copper's high thermal conductivity allows the jam to heat up rapidly to its target temperature, potentially preserving more flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. In general sugar work and candy making, copper is favored because it heats very evenly, preventing hot spots that could cause sugar to burn or seize, and its rapid heating meets the high heat requirements of candy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Safety and Linings
While copper has many benefits, it is chemically reactive with acidic foods, which can cause copper to leach into food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. While copper is an essential micronutrient in small amounts, large doses can be acutely toxic, and smaller but excessive doses over time can cause chronic toxicity, leading to symptoms like nausea, vomiting, anemia, and liver and kidney diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

This is why, traditionally, copper pans are lined on the inside with an inert, non-reactive material. Historically, this lining was tin, but nowadays, stainless steel is more commonly used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### Moscow Mule Concern
The [[safety_concerns_with_copper_cookware_and_moscow_mules | Moscow Mule cocktail]], a popular acidic drink traditionally served in an unlined copper mug, became a public health concern in 2017 when the U.S. state of Iowa issued guidelines recommending that such mugs be lined with inert materials like tin or stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. A study in the *Journal of Environmental Health* confirmed that a standard Moscow Mule can extract dangerous levels of copper from an unlined mug, with ginger beer being a significant culprit rather than lime juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The study also noted that it takes a long time for a significant amount of copper to leach out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

Paradoxically, some people believe Moscow Mules are served in copper mugs to keep them cold, due to copper's high thermal conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. However, this property is a "double-edged sword": while it chills quickly, it also rapidly conducts heat from the room, warming the drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Experiments show that a Moscow Mule in a copper mug warms up faster than one in an insulating ceramic mug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Despite this, the copper mug itself feels very cold to the touch, and this sensation on the lips can enhance the perception of coldness and overall enjoyment of the drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Some individuals also report tasting the copper, which they feel enhances the drink's flavor, possibly by enhancing astringency through copper's interaction with salivary proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

Historically, salt has been a primary method for preserving butter, long before the advent of modern refrigeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>. This practice significantly influenced butter's taste and cultural perceptions over centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## [[historical_use_of_salt_in_butter | Historical Salt Preservation]]

Salt served as an ancient preservative for various foods, including fish and meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. Butter, being a natural food product, was also salted to extend its shelf life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

### Evolution of Salt Levels

Historically, salted butter was much saltier than contemporary versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
*   **Viking Butter** The first notable European butter makers were likely the Vikings in Northern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Their butter contained about ten times the amount of salt found in modern salted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. This level of salt, approximately 16.4%, would have made the butter inedible initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. It was typically soaked in cold water to leach out some of the salt before consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Such high salt content provided necessary preservative power for extended periods, like winter when animals were not lactating, or for lengthy sea voyages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Medieval and Early Modern Butter** Even in medieval times, table butter was roughly three times saltier than today's salted butter, at about 4.9% salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. Around a hundred years ago, dairy industry publications reported butter with three or four percent salt, which is two to three times the salt content of modern butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This was considered the minimum salt needed to keep butter fresh for more than a few days without refrigeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.
*   **Modern Salted Butter** Land O'Lakes salted butter, a popular brand in the United States, contains 90 milligrams of sodium per tablespoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This translates to approximately 1.64% salt by weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Other common salted butters in grocery stores typically range from 80 to 110 milligrams of sodium per tablespoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

## Alternative Preservation Methods

Beyond salting, other methods were developed to preserve butter.

### Ghee (Clarified Butter)
In India and surrounding regions, butter was preserved by boiling it down to evaporate off the liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This process results in ghee, which, without water, prevents bacteria from forming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Making ghee was a practical necessity in the hot Indian subcontinent where solid butter cannot exist at ambient temperatures above 90°F (32°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

### Pickled Butter
A 19th-century White House cookbook contained a recipe for "pickled butter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This method involved wrapping freshly made butter in muslin and soaking it in a brine containing salt and a small amount of sugar for preservation, particularly for winter butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

### Fermentation (Cultured Butter)
[[history_of_food_preservation_methods | Fermentation]] is another means of food preservation that also imparts desirable flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **French Cultured Butter** In France, particularly regions outside Paris, dairymaids produced cultured, unsalted butter that could fetch two to three times the price of regular salted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. "Cultured butter" is made with bacterial cultures, giving it a tangy, yogurt-like taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. This practice contributed to the [[cultural_perceptions_of_butter_types | cultural notion]] that unsalted butter is fancier, as it was a luxury item prior to refrigeration, available primarily to wealthy families who could contract dairymaids for fresh, unsalted batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## Impact of Modern Technology

The significant change in butter preservation came with the advent of refrigeration and industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Large-scale, temperature-controlled logistical networks enabled the delivery of fresh butter to a wider population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. As butter production moved into creameries and factories, manufacturers could market their product as "super fresh" by reducing the salt content, implying they weren't masking rancidity or off-flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

The rise of culinary figures like Julia Child and Jacques Pépin in the 1960s and 70s also introduced the American palate to [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | unsalted butter]] not just for table use, but for [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | cooking]] as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. This further cemented the shift away from heavily salted, preservation-focused butter.

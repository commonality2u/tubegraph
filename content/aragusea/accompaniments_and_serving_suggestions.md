Indian American restaurant-style tandoori chicken is a satisfying meal on its own, especially when served with complementary vegetables and garnishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

## Prepared Vegetables

For an ideal accompaniment, fresh vegetables like white onions and green bell peppers can be prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

To prepare the vegetables:
*   **White Onion** Peel the onion, sacrificing the outermost edible layer for ease. Cut it into big, thick slices and push the rings out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   **Green Bell Pepper** Cut off the top, remove the seeds, and then lay it on its side to cut into big rings that match the onion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. This amount of vegetables is sufficient for two or three people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

### Cooking the Vegetables
While ideally the vegetables would be grilled alongside the chicken, they can also be cooked indoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. A cast iron pan on high heat is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Add a little neutral oil to the hot pan until it's smoking, then quickly add the vegetables and a little salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. Allow them to sit for a moment to achieve brown edges while keeping the interior virtually raw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. Toss once or twice. To maintain crispness, remove them from the heat before they appear fully cooked, as they will continue to soften as they sit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

## Final Plating and Garnish

Serve the tandoori chicken on a bed of the prepared vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. A wedge of lemon is an essential garnish; squeeze plenty of fresh lemon juice over the chicken and vegetables before serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

## Completeness of the Meal

The combination of protein from the chicken and the accompanying vegetables creates a totally satisfying meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. There is no need to prepare additional side dishes like rice, naan, or roti with this meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

Historically, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommended cooking whole cuts of pork to 160 degrees Fahrenheit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This conservative guidance was largely based on concerns about trichinosis, a severe parasitic disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

## Modern Guidelines and Trichinosis

In 2011, the USDA updated its recommendations, stating that whole cuts of pork are safe to eat when cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit, provided they are allowed to rest for a couple of minutes afterward. This resting period allows the internal temperature to rise slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Pork cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit post-rest will appear slightly pink, which is considered safe and tasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

The decline in trichinosis cases in the United States is largely due to improved practices within the [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | pork industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Currently, most people who contract trichinosis in the U.S. do so from wild game rather than commercially produced pork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## Other Bacterial Risks

Despite the reduced risk of trichinosis, bacteria such as Salmonella can still pose a concern with pork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. For whole cuts of pork, like beef, these bacteria are primarily found on the surface of the muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Therefore, pink pork chops are generally safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

However, the situation differs for ground pork products like sausage. Similar to [[contamination_and_cooking_of_beef_and_ground_beef | ground beef]], the external surface of the meat, which may have been exposed to bacteria during processing, gets mixed throughout the product during grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Because of this, pink sausage is considered unsafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

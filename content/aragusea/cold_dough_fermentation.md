Cold dough fermentation, often achieved by aging [[pizza_dough_preparation_and_cold_rise_method | pizza dough]] in the refrigerator, is a simple method to achieve exceptionally crispy and flavorful "pizza bread" or pizza crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This technique leverages the slow activity of yeast at cold temperatures to develop complex flavors and improved textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Benefits of Cold Fermentation

Unlike traditional methods using sourdough starters or biga, [[aging pizza dough | cold dough fermentation]] in the age of refrigeration makes complex flavor development easy and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The primary advantages include:
*   **Enhanced Flavor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>
*   **Improved Texture** (crispier exterior, chewier interior) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>
*   **Easier Handling** (cold dough is stiffer and less sticky) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   **Gluten Development** (gluten develops over time, effectively "kneading" the dough for you) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>

## Pizza Dough Recipe for Cold Fermentation

A large batch of standard [[pizza_dough_preparation | pizza dough]] is ideal for this experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Ingredients
*   Warm water (half a cup, plus four more cups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   Sugar (two teaspoons, plus two tablespoons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Yeast (two teaspoons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   Salt (two tablespoons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Olive oil (about a quarter cup, plus more for coating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   Bread flour (ten cups initially, with more added as needed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

### Preparation
1.  **Activate Yeast:** Combine half a cup of warm water with two teaspoons of sugar and two teaspoons of yeast. Stir and let bloom for five minutes to ensure the yeast is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
2.  **Mix Liquids:** Add four more cups of water, two tablespoons of sugar, two tablespoons of salt, and about a quarter cup of olive oil to the yeast mixture. Stir to combine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
3.  **Incorporate Flour:** Begin by adding ten cups of bread flour and mix with a spatula until it comes together. Then, switch to hand-kneading, adding just enough flour to make kneading possible while keeping the dough wet and sticky for better flavor and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
4.  **Knead:** Knead the dough until it can be stretched thin without tearing, which took about seven minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
5.  **Portion and Store:** Divide the dough into approximately 300-gram portions, suitable for a 12 or 13-inch pizza or one "pizza bread" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Coat each portion with olive oil, as this helps the dough brown at home oven temperatures and contributes to the final texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Store in sealed glass containers to prevent leaching chemicals during the long rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Immediately refrigerate the portions (samples 2 through 8 for the experiment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. It is not necessary to pre-rise the dough at room temperature before refrigerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Day-by-Day Changes in Dough and Baked Product

The cold rise significantly impacts the dough's characteristics and the final baked result.

### Day 0 (No Cold Rise)
*   **Dough:** Smooth on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Baked Product:** After a two-hour room temperature rise and immediate baking, the "pizza bread" tastes bland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The texture is very soft and pillowy, lacking crispness and chewiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Internal bubbles are large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Day 1 (24 Hours Cold Rise)
*   **Dough:** Dough has risen significantly in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The underside becomes rougher and bubbly, which helps it hold more oil and crisp in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. It's much easier to handle when cold due to its stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Baked Product:** The bubble structure is finer; a slow cold rise produces the same amount of air divided among a larger number of smaller bubbles, which is preferred for pizza crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The flavor is still a bit flat, but the texture is less pillowy, offering some crunch and chew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Day 2 (48 Hours Cold Rise)
*   **Dough:** The dough becomes a little stickier and begins to emit a beer-like smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Baked Product:** The texture is still slightly pillowy in an undesirable way, but the flavor has improved, exhibiting a yeasty, fermented taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Day 3 (72 Hours Cold Rise)
*   **Dough:** The dough becomes very sticky, and the underside is noticeably uneven and bubbly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Baking with the bottom side up is recommended to utilize this bubbly surface for extra crispness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Baked Product:** The surface becomes much crispier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This is likely due to the breakdown of starches into simpler sugars during fermentation, which caramelize more readily in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It also starts to develop a "glassy top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Day 4 (96 Hours Cold Rise)
*   **Dough:** A delicious smell like ripe banana becomes noticeable in both the raw and cooked dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Day 5 (120 Hours Cold Rise)
*   **Dough:** The dough becomes extremely gooey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It would be almost impossible to handle if not cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Baked Product:** Despite being slightly undercooked, the flavor is "insane" with a ripe banana note, funky, and complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Day 6 (144 Hours Cold Rise)
*   **Baked Product:** The top surface becomes incredibly crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The interior is also notably chewier. Given enough time with wet dough, gluten develops on its own, essentially "kneading" the dough for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Day 7 (Full Week Cold Rise)
*   **Dough:** The dough is super gooey and sticky, making it very difficult to handle even when cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The underside (which is now the top for baking) is very craggy, allowing oil to soak in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Baked Product:** The top is extremely crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The flavor is comparable to sourdough, and in a semantic sense, it essentially becomes sourdough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This method provides similar results to traditional sourdough starters without the maintenance required to keep a starter alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Baking Pizza Bread
To make "pizza bread":
1.  Coat the dough surface with plenty of olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
2.  Grind on pepper, shake over plenty of garlic powder (which provides an umami taste), and sprinkle a good amount of large, crunchy flaky salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Be careful not to burn the garlic powder, as it tastes nasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
3.  Bake on a pizza stone (preheated for at least half an hour at maximum convection oven temperature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. A pizza steel tends to burn this type of bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
4.  Bake until brown, typically 7 or 8 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
5.  Remove with tongs onto a cooling rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
6.  Slice once lengthwise and then into smaller strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

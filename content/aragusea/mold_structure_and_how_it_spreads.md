[[moldy_food_and_its_potential_health_risks | Moldy food]] generally shouldn't be eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While consuming a large amount of mold at once can cause severe sickness, eating a small amount usually won't have an immediate effect, unless one is allergic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, repeated consumption of small quantities of mold over many years is thought by scientists to lead to serious health problems, including cancer, and kidney and liver disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## What is Mold?

Molds are a type of fungi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Unlike animals, fungi do not move or possess nervous systems, making them somewhat plant-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Yet, they differ from plants because they do not photosynthesize or produce their own food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Instead, fungi consume existing organic matter, akin to animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

While molds are fungi, they are distinct from [[textural_analysis_and_characteristics_of_cooked_mushrooms | mushrooms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Molds are considered smaller, distant cousins of mushrooms, though they share many molecular similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Dr. Megan Bianco Daniels, a mycologist specializing in food spoilage, compares mushrooms to trees, which have roots, trunks, leaves, and various specialized tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Mushrooms similarly have underground root equivalents and a fruiting body (the mushroom itself) with a stem, cap, and gills for reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

In this analogy, mold is to a mushroom as green algae is to a tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. If this algae is considered a plant, it has very few distinct parts, lacking stems or leaves, and is mostly composed of threads of the same basic cell type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Molds are the fungal equivalent, generally lacking tissue specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Mold Structure

For the most part, molds consist of threads of fungal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Hyphae**: These are the individual threads of fungal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Mycelium**: This term refers to the broader network of interconnected hyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. In moldy bread, mycelia can sometimes be seen with the naked eye, appearing as thin, white, spider web-like structures that can be difficult to distinguish from gluten strands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. While [[textural_analysis_and_characteristics_of_cooked_mushrooms | mushrooms]] also grow from mycelia, with molds, the mycelia constitute almost the entire organism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Spores**: Molds may send up tiny, microscopic spore-bearing structures for reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. The blue-green fuzzy material often seen on the surface of moldy bread is typically the spores themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## How Mold Feeds and Spreads

Mold threads (hyphae) begin from an individual spore and grow, actively searching for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Like other fungi, molds release enzymes into their environment to dissolve nutrients in the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. They then absorb these digested nutrients to sustain their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Mold spreads primarily through its spores. These spores are naturally loose on the surface of the mold and easily become airborne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. They can be carried away by a gust of wind or an animal (including humans) to other wet and nutrient-rich environments, where they can then germinate and grow into new hyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The incredible diversity and resilience of mold spores allow them to remain dormant in the environment for extended periods, simply awaiting favorable conditions, such as a fresh loaf of bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Invisible Growth

The visible portion of mold on food is often just the "tip of the iceberg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The majority of the organism, the mycelia, spreads freely through the soft, open structure of foods like bread, where it can easily go unnoticed because it resembles gluten strands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. If visible spores are present on a food's surface, it's highly likely that extensive mycelia have already permeated the entire item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

The hidden mycelia are often where the mold produces chemicals that can alter the food's texture and flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This includes [[mycotoxins_and_their_effects_on_health | mycotoxins]], which are toxic secondary metabolites not essential for the mold's basic growth but can migrate beyond the mold's physical body in the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This migration is more probable in soft or wet foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Prevention

To minimize the risk of mold growth, especially on susceptible foods, keep them tightly wrapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Mold needs air to grow once its spores land on food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Sealing foods away from air can help them last longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. However, as long as nutrients are available and the food is not too acidic, mold will eventually appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

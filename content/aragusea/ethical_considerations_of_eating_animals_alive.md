From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

The practice of consuming animals that remain alive during and after the process of being eaten raises profound questions about the nature of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This differs from animals that are merely alive when consumption begins but die shortly thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Oysters: An Initial Example

Oysters are a common example of an animal that is alive when eating begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. When ordered at a restaurant, the bivalve is fully intact and alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Upon shucking, the oyster begins to die, but if shucked fresh, it is still living when consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The animal then dies in the consumer's stomach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Stone Crabs: The Case of Ongoing Life

A more complex example involves animals that not only are alive when eating starts but remain alive throughout the process and long after the meal is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. These animals can survive the experience of being eaten and potentially live to be harvested again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This refers to certain types of crabs, most commonly the stone crab in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Harvesting Method

Millions of stone crabs are caught in traps off the Florida coast annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Since there is almost no usable meat in their main central body (carapace), only the giant, meaty claws are harvested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. To harvest, a claw must be measured, and if it's more than 2.75 inches, it can be removed, and the crab returned to the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Autotomy and Regeneration

Stone crabs, once returned to the water, are theoretically able to survive, thrive, reproduce, and even regrow their claws, potentially allowing for future harvests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This ability stems from a biological function called autotomy, where crabs can self-amputate their own claws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

This function is also seen in animals like lizards, which can detach their tails to evade predators and regrow a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. However, crabs are more adept at regeneration; while a lizard's regrown tail is often short and lacks bone, a crab can regrow a real, fully functional claw through its molting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Crabs can actively "throw off" their own limb as a reflex action, not necessarily a conscious choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This active ejection allows the animal to break away at a specific point where there is a diaphragm that can close off and seal the wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Historical Assumptions vs. Scientific Findings

Historically, fisher folk believed that since crabs deliberately jettison their claws, tearing them off for consumption was essentially the same, causing no harm and allowing the crab to live another day, making it a highly sustainable practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. However, scientific research has challenged this view:

*   **1978 Everglades National Park Study**: Researchers collected 200 healthy stone crabs and ripped off their claws in aquariums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   Approximately half of the crabs that lost both claws died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   About one-third of the crabs that lost one claw died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
    *   A majority of deaths occurred within 24 hours, primarily due to trauma and fluid loss (their equivalent of blood) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   It was posited that in the wild, where declawed crabs must compete for food, mates, and shelter, and avoid predators, the mortality rate would be even higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

*   **Recent Florida Wildlife Commission Study (2011-2012)**: This study observed crabs in large pens in their natural habitat along the Gulf Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   40% of one-armed crabs died during the season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   60% of crabs with no arms died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   A control group of crabs that kept their claws had a 13% mortality rate, as "nobody lives forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
    *   Declawing significantly increased mortality odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
    *   Higher temperatures also seemed to increase mortality rates for declawed crabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

*   **Impact on Survival and Reproduction**: Research indicates that even if crabs survive the declawing trauma, they struggle in the wild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. They have difficulty cracking open shellfish, their preferred food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, and energy that could be used for reproduction is diverted to regrowing the claw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

*   **Odds of Second Harvest**: A study from South Carolina found that only 3% of crabs successfully regrew a claw of legally harvestable size, meaning the odds of a second harvest from the same crab are very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This is partly due to the crab's natural, relatively short lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Animal Harvesting Practices

While the mortality rates for declawed crabs are significant, they are still better than the 100% mortality rate for beef cattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The argument is made that "where there's life, there's hope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
[[comparison_between_different_animal_harvesting_practices | Comparison between different animal harvesting practices]] reveals that even if a stone crab dies after declawing, its body remains in the ocean ecosystem and can become food for other creatures, unlike a whole crab cooked and discarded in a landfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

The research suggests that stone crabs have a much better chance of survival if their claws are removed properly, specifically by breaking them along the diaphragm that seals off the wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### The Question of Pain and Consciousness

A significant ethical question arises: "Is the crab suffering?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> It is debated whether an animal with a small brain and simple nervous system has the capacity to experience pain in a way similar to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Crabs have been observed to recoil from physical danger and avoid situations where they have been harmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. However, whether this behavior is merely instinct or reflex, or evidence of consciousness, remains scientifically uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

In contrast, when bigger-brained animals are eaten, there is generally an effort to extinguish their consciousness before slaughtering them, such as knocking a cow unconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. For crabs, the possibility of surviving the process of becoming dinner always exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

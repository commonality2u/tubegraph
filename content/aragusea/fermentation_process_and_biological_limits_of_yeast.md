## Introduction to Alcoholic Beverages

Broadly, liquor is defined as any alcoholic beverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. An alcoholic beverage is generally considered drinkable and contains at least one or two percent ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Ethanol is the specific type of alcohol consumed for recreational purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It is chemically structured with two carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms, which are then attached to a hydroxyl group (an oxygen atom bonded to a hydrogen atom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Drinks with less than one percent ethanol are virtually impossible to cause intoxication, regardless of the quantity consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. For instance, most fruit juices sold in grocery stores contain about half a percent ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Most beverages recognized as alcoholic contain at least a few percentage points of ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Role of Yeast in Alcohol Production

In traditionally made beer or wine, the creation of alcohol begins with the introduction of [[process_of_yeast_fermentation_in_bread_making | yeast]] to a sweet, nutrient-rich liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The [[process_of_yeast_fermentation_in_bread_making | yeast]] [[process_of_yeast_fermentation_in_bread_making | metabolize]] (eat) this liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The byproducts they produce, essentially "poop out," include ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This process is a key aspect of [[vinegar_production_and_fermentation_process | fermentation]].

## Biological Limits of Yeast Fermentation

Ethanol is, in fact, a poison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. When [[process_of_yeast_fermentation_in_bread_making | yeast]] are used to make beer from grain or wine from grapes, they can only raise the ethanol concentration in the brew to a certain level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Beyond this point, the ethanol becomes toxic to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. High concentrations of ethanol disrupt proteins and cell membranes within the [[process_of_yeast_fermentation_in_bread_making | yeast]] cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Depending on the specific type of [[process_of_yeast_fermentation_in_bread_making | yeast]] used and other variables, the ethanol content typically reaches the "teens" (percentage) before the [[process_of_yeast_fermentation_in_bread_making | yeast]] can no longer survive or function effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This biological limitation explains why beer and wine generally do not exceed an alcohol content somewhere in the teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. To achieve higher alcohol concentrations, these fermented beverages must undergo further processing, such as distillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

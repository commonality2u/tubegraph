America's popular Hershey bar is perceived very differently by people from other parts of the world, with many non-Americans stating it tastes like "vomit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This specific taste is so dominant in the U.S. market that other major chocolate brands there often imitate it, shaping what American consumers expect chocolate to taste like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with chocolate from other regions, such as Cadbury, particularly British Cadbury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

## The Role of Milk in Chocolate History

The distinct taste differences between Hershey's and Cadbury's likely originate from how milk was incorporated into their respective chocolates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### Evolution of Milk Chocolate
For much of its 4,000-year history, chocolate was consumed as a beverage by ancient Mesoamericans, often for medicinal and ceremonial purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Europeans, who acquired chocolate via the Aztecs, initially used it as medicine, but soon began adding sugar for pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Milk was eventually introduced to these chocolate drinks to smooth and thicken the texture and round off bitter flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>.

It was not until the 19th century that European confectioners began experimenting with solid chocolate products, combining cocoa powder, cocoa fat, sugar, and eventually milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Early dark chocolate was often described as gritty and harsh, making the addition of milk particularly advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Nestle and Cadbury Innovations
Since milk is mostly water and does not mix with fat, and high water content confections can mold, a solution was needed for solid milk chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. The Nestle company was founded in Switzerland when Henri Nestle developed a process for dehydrated powdered milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Nestle's neighbor, Daniel Peter, added this powdered milk to his solid chocolate mix, creating an early form of milk chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Cadbury's first solid milk chocolate in England also utilized powdered milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. However, chocolatiers soon discovered that using condensed milk, which has much of its water boiled out but remains a liquid, resulted in an even smoother, tastier product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### Hershey's Unique Process
In the United States, Milton Hershey developed his own milk chocolate process starting in 1903 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. He initially used skim milk, as milk fat would go rancid and was unsuitable for the shelf-stable, mass-produced product he envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Hershey cooked milk in a giant copper vacuum pan at low temperatures to drive off water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

Eventually, a factory worker named John Schmalbach found success by mixing skim milk with sugar and cooking it in the vacuum pan at a very low temperature for a long time, then allowing it to cool in the vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. This process yielded a chocolate that was smooth, shelf-stable, and well-suited for mass production using a system of pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

## The Distinctive Hershey Taste: Butyric Acid
Chocolate experts generally agree that the unique "sour" taste in Hershey's chocolate comes from [[chemistry_of_butyric_acid_in_hershey_chocolate | butyric acid]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. This "butter acid" is created by lipolyzing (breaking down fat content) in the milk during the low-temperature reduction process that Schmalbach invented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

Butyric acid can be produced through anaerobic fermentation, which occurred in Hershey's vacuum pan process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Importantly, butyric acid is also created in our digestive systems and is responsible for the signature "twang" or smell associated with vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. This is why people who didn't grow up consuming Hershey's often describe its taste as reminiscent of vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

However, for Americans who grew up eating Hershey's chocolate frequently, butyric acid tastes like chocolate, not sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. This highlights the powerful role of exposure and conditioning in taste perception.

## Taste and Texture Comparison

### British vs. American Perceptions
For many Americans, British chocolate like Cadbury's can taste "flat" or "dull," lacking the acidity they are accustomed to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. British chocolate often feels "fatty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>, partly because Cadbury uses vegetable oils in addition to cocoa butter, contributing to its smoother, creamier texture compared to Hershey's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

### American Cadbury
It is important to note that the American version of Cadbury Dairy Milk is distributed and partially manufactured by Hershey's itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. Its recipe has been adjusted for the U.S. market and does not contain vegetable oil, as this is not legally allowed in products labeled as "chocolate" in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a> Despite this, it still tastes significantly different from a Hershey bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

### Texture: Waxy vs. Creamy
Hershey haters often describe its texture as "waxy" when compared to Cadbury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. Cocoa butter can become waxy when cold, and some, like the speaker, enjoy this characteristic "snap" when storing chocolate bars in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

A 2015 BBC focus group comparing Hershey's and Cadbury found that adult participants generally preferred Cadbury, describing Hershey's as "harder," "more bitter," and "not as rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. Interestingly, British children were more likely to choose the Hershey bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

## Sugar and Cocoa Content

### Sugar Content
Despite popular belief, a BBC investigation found that Hershey's and Cadbury have approximately the same proportion of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. The perception of higher sugar in Hershey's is largely due to different labeling regulations in the UK versus the US; British labeling lists milk based on its liquid weight, not evaporated weight, making it appear higher on the ingredient list for Cadbury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

### Cocoa Content
It may be the case that the Hershey bar has proportionately less cocoa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. European Union standards for minimum cocoa content in milk chocolate are higher than U.S. standards, though direct comparison is complex due to different measurement metrics (dry cocoa solids vs. chocolate liquor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. A Hershey spokesman claimed Hershey's contains 30% cocoa solids, which would be higher than the 23% Cadbury claims for its product (though this may refer to the UK version of Hershey's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Regardless, a Hershey bar certainly has far less cocoa than a fine European dark chocolate bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. This is largely due to cocoa being expensive and having an intense flavor, both undesirable for mass-market chocolates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

## Subjectivity of Quality

The question of whether Hershey's is an "objectively inferior product" is a matter of debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. While some argue that chocolate with less cocoa is objectively "lesser chocolate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>, extending this logic would imply that unsweetened baking chocolate (100% cocoa) is the "finest chocolate bar," which is unpalatable to most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

Others argue that Hershey bars are objectively bad because they taste like human vomit, due to the presence of butyric acid, which humans are evolved to find repulsive as an indicator of danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. However, many great foods, like European fermented milk products such as Parmesan cheese, also contain butyric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

When it comes to desserts and candy, which have no nutritional purpose and are purely for pleasure, the concept of "objectively good or bad food" becomes complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. Personal pleasure and [[cultural_perceptions_of_butter_types | childhood memories]] often heavily influence taste perception; for example, the speaker's positive association with Hershey's stems from growing up with it in central Pennsylvania and visiting Hershey Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

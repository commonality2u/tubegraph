Using a cast iron skillet can replicate restaurant-quality results for dishes like naan, even without specialized equipment like a tandoor or oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Benefits of Cast Iron Skillets

*   **Effective for Specific Techniques**
    *   A cast iron skillet works well for cooking naan using a method that requires the dough to stick to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
    *   It is considered a good alternative to a traditional tawa, a flat round griddle pan used in Indian cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
*   **Versatility with Heat Sources**
    *   Cast iron skillets perform well on electric resistance coil stoves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. The technique of inverting the pan over the burner also works well with cast iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. However, this inversion method is not suitable for induction stoves because induction doesn't heat the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.
*   **Superior Adhesion Control**
    *   With proper [[maintenance_and_seasoning_of_cast_iron_pans | seasoning]], cast iron allows the naan dough to stick when desired and release when ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.
    *   Compared to stainless steel pans, cast iron yields much better results for methods where dough needs to stick, as naan tends to fall out of stainless steel pans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

*   **Baked Flavor Profile**
    *   Cooking naan in a cast iron skillet without oil, relying on a starch paste layer for adhesion, results in a baked flavor rather than a fried one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
    *   This cooking method in a cast iron skillet, with the top cooked by hot, dry air, creates crispy bubbles and a baked taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

## Challenges of Using a Cast Iron Skillet

*   **Learning Curve for Temperature and Timing**
    *   Finding the correct heat setting (e.g., medium or slightly less than medium) on a stove for cooking naan in a cast iron skillet requires experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
    *   Guessing when the bottom of the dough is cooked, without un-sticking it to check, takes practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. The first hint of a burnt smell often indicates it's time to cook the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.
*   **[[maintenance_and_seasoning_of_cast_iron_pans | Seasoning]] Maintenance**
    *   The seasoning coat on cast iron can be "messed up" and may require re-seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. A quick re-seasoning involves cleaning the pan, heating it on high, applying a thin spray of oil, and letting it burn until it stops smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.
*   **Cleaning Between Uses**
    *   A quick wash and dry of the pan are necessary after cooking each naan, as residue from the previous naan can interfere with the sticking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.
*   **Releasing Cooked Naan**
    *   Unsticking the bread from a cast iron skillet can be challenging, particularly because the skillet has sides that can get in the way, unlike a tawa which has no sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

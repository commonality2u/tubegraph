Making a great vegetable soup is described as a comically easy and cheap process that emphasizes simplicity and the natural flavors of vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20">[05:20]</a>. The core principle involves boiling chopped vegetables in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32">[03:32]</a>.

## Starting the Soup Base

The foundation of a good vegetable soup begins with simple ingredients and minimal fuss.

### Onions and Carrots
To start, chop up some form of onion, such as a shallot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15">[00:15]</a>. Contrary to complex methods involving slow caramelization with star anise for half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19">[00:19]</a>, the true "secret" is to simply chop the onion and put it in a pot with water to boil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31">[00:31]</a>.

Next, peel and chop a carrot into small pieces and add them to the boiling water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34">[00:34]</a>. Start with longer-cooking ingredients like onions and hard vegetables such as carrots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13">[01:13]</a>.

### Broth
Instead of spending hours making homemade chicken stock or buying expensive carton stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41">[00:41]</a>, the recommendation is to use plain water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54">[00:54]</a>. Cooking vegetables in plain water allows their flavors to shine through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59">[00:59]</a>. Onions, especially, create a delicious broth with just water, heat, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06">[01:06]</a>, and carrots add sweetness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11">[01:11]</a>. Not every meal requires an animal product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57">[00:57]</a>.

## Tomato Preparation

While some culinary techniques suggest elaborately preparing tomatoes, a simpler approach is recommended for vegetable soup.

### Simple Tomato Inclusion
Avoid the complex process of [[steps_to_concasse_a_tomato_for_soup | concass√©ing a tomato]], which involves boiling for 10 seconds, plunging into ice water to remove the skin, and then cutting out the seeds and acidic gel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20">[01:20]</a>.

For vegetable soup, simply chop any decent tomato into random chunks and boil it in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57">[01:57]</a>. Tomato skins are rich in lycopene (a great antioxidant) and pectin, which helps thicken the soup as it cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19">[02:19]</a>. The acidity from the seeds and gel is also desirable in the soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29">[02:29]</a>. Tomatoes should be added after the hard ingredients have been in the water, allowing them to cook until they fall apart while still retaining some freshness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45">[02:45]</a>.

## Enhancing Flavor

Even without animal broth, several ingredients can significantly elevate the soup's taste.

### Acidity with Wine or Vinegar
Adding white wine provides fruity sweetness and acidity to the broth, and it helps extract alcohol-soluble flavors from the vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54">[02:54]</a>. This technique helps compensate for the absence of animal broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08">[03:08]</a>.

If you prefer to avoid alcohol, a small quantity of white balsamic vinegar, just a splash at the end, can be used for a similar acidic effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11">[03:11]</a>.

### Incorporating Leafy Greens
After hard vegetables have cooked for about 20 minutes, add some form of cabbage, such as Tuscan kale or Savoy cabbage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19">[03:19]</a>. Crinkly-leaved varieties are preferred as they deliver more broth per square inch to the mouth, providing a satisfying, juicy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28">[03:28]</a>. Chop the greens into ribbons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39">[03:39]</a>. These "brassicas" should not be overcooked, as they can become unpleasant; cook them for about 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45">[03:45]</a>.

The amount of water can be adjusted; if the soup is too thick, resembling a stew, more water can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51">[03:51]</a>.

## Finishing Touches

The final additions enhance both flavor and presentation.

### Aromatic and Fresh Ingredients
*   **Garlic**: Chop some garlic and add it at the very end after turning off the heat to preserve its pungency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05">[04:05]</a>. This is a classic minestrone technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11">[04:11]</a>.
*   **Frozen Peas**: Dump in some frozen peas at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>. They are delicious, sweet, convenient, and add a bright green color, compensating for any browning of the cabbage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[04:17]</a>. Their coldness also helps cool the soup to eating temperature faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27">[04:27]</a>, which is important because dissolved pectins in the broth won't thicken until the soup cools down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39">[04:39]</a>.

### Seasoning and Garnish
Once the soup reaches eating temperature, season it with salt to taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50">[04:50]</a>. A large batch of soup may require a significant amount of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>.

Before serving, consider tearing in some fresh basil or other herbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00">[05:00]</a>. A drizzle of nice, fruity raw olive oil on top is also recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06">[05:06]</a>. This not only tastes amazing but helps the body absorb fat-soluble vitamins from the vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13">[05:13]</a>.

## Philosophy of Simple Soup
The concept of boiling whatever ingredients are available in water and eating it is a classic method of food preparation that has existed for thousands of years since the advent of water-safe pottery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23">[05:23]</a>. There is "no honor in making your own dinner the hard way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37">[05:37]</a>; the goal is simply to create a satisfying and beneficial meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43">[05:43]</a>.

From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

The broiling method for cookies is an unconventional approach primarily used to achieve a specific aesthetic appearance on the cookie's surface while maintaining a desirable chewy interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This technique is applied to a specific variation of the [[chocolate_chip_cookie_recipe_variation | chocolate chip cookie recipe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Dough Recipe Variation

The dough for this method is a variation of the traditional [[chocolate_chip_cookie_recipe_variation | familiar recipe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Ingredients

*   **Butter**: Two sticks of salted butter, melted all the way down instead of softened. This yields a denser, chewier texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Sugar**: Two full cups of sugar, which is more than a typical cup and a half. The extra sugar contributes to the chewier texture rather than increased sweetness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Molasses**: A small amount ("glug") of molasses, used as a substitute for keeping brown sugar in the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Vanilla**: A small amount ("glug") of vanilla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Eggs**: Two whole eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Salt**: Two teaspoons of salt. Extra salt is considered delicious in cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Baking Soda**: One teaspoon of baking soda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Flour**: [[bread_baking_techniques | Bread flour]] is used, starting with two cups and adding more until the desired texture is achieved (approximately two and a half cups total). While it was thought to contribute to chewiness, it primarily results in a smoother texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Preparation Notes

*   **Mixing**: The wet ingredients are mixed until smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Dough Consistency**: The ideal dough should look wet but not be very sticky, pulling away from the fingers easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Less flour can be used for thinner cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Chilling**: The dough is refrigerated for at least 30 minutes. This makes the dough easier to work with and helps prevent the cookies from spreading too thin during baking, especially when using melted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Traditional Baking vs. Broiling Method

While the dough can be baked traditionally by shaping it into golf balls and baking at 375°F (190°C) for about 12 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, this often results in a pale, slightly gray hue in the underdone middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The broiling method is used to solve this cosmetic issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Broiling Method Steps

The broiling method aims to achieve a golden top while retaining the desired gooey, underdone center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

1.  **Shape the Dough**: Form the chilled dough into golf balls, then smash them down into "hockey pucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
2.  **Parchment Paper**: Place the shaped dough on parchment paper on a baking sheet to prevent sticking and eliminate the need for washing the sheet pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
3.  **Broil**: Place the hockey pucks under the [[cooking_techniques_grilling_vs_broiling | broiler]] (similar to [[using_an_oven_broiler_for_pizza | using an oven broiler for pizza]]) until their tops are just golden, which takes approximately one minute. Close attention is required to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
4.  **Bake**: Turn the oven to its baking mode and allow the broiler to cool down for about a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Then, return the cookies to the oven for 10 to 12 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
5.  **Observe Doneness**: As the cookies bake and spread, cracks will appear on their formerly smooth surface. These cracks are used to judge the doneness of the cookie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

This method results in cookies that look nicer with a more appealing appearance, while still maintaining the desired slightly underdone, gooey center when hot, and chewy texture when cooled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Multiple pans of cookies can be broiled in succession and then baked together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

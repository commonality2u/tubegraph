When purchasing salmon fillets, a primary consideration is whether to choose farmed or wild varieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Key Differences

### Color
The color of salmon meat is a noticeable differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>:
*   **Farmed Salmon** typically has a pale orange color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This flesh would naturally be gray if farmers did not add the pigment astaxanthin to their feed to mimic the wild color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Farmers may "skimp" on astaxanthin because it is an expensive feed additive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Wild Salmon** exhibits a more intense color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For example, sockeye salmon, one of the five major wild salmon species, has the most reddish hue, often compared to the inside of a blood orange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Wild salmon naturally obtain astaxanthin from the crustaceans they consume, and they get significantly more of it than farmed salmon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Fat Content and Type
*   **Appearance**: White ribbons running through the meat are an indicator of fat content and are common in farmed salmon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Farmed salmon generally has a higher overall fat content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Omega Fatty Acids**: Both farmed and wild salmon contain a mix of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   Wild salmon is considered superior due to its fat type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For individuals consuming a standard Western diet, a higher intake of omega-3s and lower omega-6s is often recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Wild salmon provides this beneficial ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   Farmed salmon has a proportionally much higher omega-6 content, which may make it less healthy for most consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   [[Nutritional benefits of salmon | Nutritional Benefits]]: Wild salmon is rich in omega-3s and naturally full of astaxanthin, both of which offer potential health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Availability and Freezing
Unless one lives near an Alaskan fishery, wild salmon will typically be sold frozen, having been thawed by the grocery store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This is because the wild salmon harvest occurs once a year, necessitating freezing for year-round availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Modern flash-freezing methods are highly effective at preserving quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Freezing also eliminates parasites, which are the main pathogen concern in raw salmon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Sourcing
Bristol Bay, Alaska, is home to the largest and most sustainable wild salmon run globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Over 90% of wild salmon caught in the U.S. originates from Alaska, with 75% of wild sockeye salmon caught in Alaska coming from Bristol Bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This region supports approximately 8,000 small-boat fishermen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

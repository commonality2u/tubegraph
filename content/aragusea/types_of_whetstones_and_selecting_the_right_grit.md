Whetstones, or "stones" as they are commonly called (from an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning "to sharpen" or "to prepare"), are used for sharpening kitchen knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. While [[Differences between pullthrough sharpeners and whetstones | pull-through sharpeners]] are convenient and effective for home cooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, professionals generally sharpen with stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Sharpening with stones offers several advantages:
*   A stone remains cool, which prevents the blade from detempering (losing its hardness), a common issue with mechanical grinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   It results in a finer, cleaner edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Less steel is removed during sharpening compared to mechanical grinding, extending the life of the knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Stones provide total control, allowing for very narrow (sharp) or wider (tough) cutting angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   They can be used for both standard Western double-beveled knives and single-beveled Asian-style knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Whetstone Grit and Knife Teeth

The profile of a knife edge, also known as its "teeth," is determined by the grit of the stone used for sharpening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   A coarser stone, with larger micro-particles, will cut bigger, wider teeth into the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   A finer stone, with smaller particles, will take smaller chunks out of the blade, resulting in smaller teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

The number on a sharpening stone indicates the particle size; confusingly, a *bigger* number means a *smaller* particle size, because the number relates to the spatial density of particles (more small particles fit in a given area) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

For general sharpening, a medium-grit stone (e.g., around 1200 grit) is used for the initial phase of cutting the new edge and creating a "burr" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. A finer stone is then used to polish off the burr and align the micro-serrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. A truly sharp knife, with fine teeth, can shave hair and dice an onion without causing tears, as it ruptures fewer cell walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

However, if teeth are too small, they may struggle to bite into tough items like tomato skins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Advanced sharpeners may finish a knife with a coarser stone for specific tasks (e.g., cutting certain things) or a finer stone for others (e.g., raw fish like sashimi, where a glossy smooth finish is desired) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Selecting Grit Based on Knife Type

The choice of stone grit also depends on the type of knife and its steel hardness, indicated by the Rockwell hardness scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

*   **German or European-style knives:** These typically have a Rockwell hardness of 52-58 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. For these, finishing in the 2000 to 4000 grit range is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Going beyond this range might not improve the edge and could even make it feel duller due to the steel's chromium content and softness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Japanese or Asian-style knives:** These often have higher Rockwell hardness, frequently reaching into the 60s, making them harder than window glass (which is around 60 Rockwell hardness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Harder steel can hold a finer, narrower edge with very tiny, spiky teeth, resulting in very sharp, clean cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. However, extremely hard steel is less flexible and more brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. For such knives, a coarser finishing stone would knock off the fine edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. A much finer finishing stone (e.g., 6000-8000 grit) is needed for these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Hybrid East-West Knives:** These knives, like a typical low-to-mid-market chef's knife, combine elements of Japanese smithing tailored for the German and French market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. They are designed to hold a 15 or 17-degree cutting edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a> and use steel that is slightly harder than normal German steel but not so hard as to be brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. For these, a 4000 to 6000 grit finishing stone is ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Essential Whetstone Gear

To begin sharpening with stones, you will need a minimum of three items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>:

1.  **A Coarse Stone:** Used for the initial phase of cutting out the new edge and forming the burr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Beginners are advised to start with a medium-grit stone rather than super coarse ones to avoid grinding off too much material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
2.  **A Fine Stone:** Used to polish off the burr and align the knife's micro-serrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
3.  **A Flattening Stone:** Also called a lapping stone or leveling plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Sharpening removes material from the stone, causing it to become uneven or "dished" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. A flattening stone, which must be bigger and harder than your sharpening stones, is used to re-level them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. It also helps bring up "mud," the grit that acts as a lubricant during sharpening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. A diamond plate is a common type of flattening tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a> and can also be used to fix major structural flaws in a knife, like chips or dull points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

### Combo Stones

While combo stones have one grit on one side and a different grit on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, they are not highly recommended. Because sharpening wears down both sides, a combo stone can eventually become uneven on both sides, leading to inconsistent angles when sharpening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## Whetstone Types: Soaking vs. Splash-and-Go

All whetstones (with an 'h') need to be wet (without an 'h') for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Soaking stones:** These must be soaked in water far in advance until air bubbles stop releasing, indicating they are ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Pros often keep them permanently submerged ("perma-soak"), though the water needs periodic changing to prevent mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Soaking stones are generally less expensive and more porous, offering better tactile feedback for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Splash-and-go stones:** These only need to be wet as you use them, offering more convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. However, they are typically more expensive, harder, and less porous, which can make them less ideal for beginners due to reduced tactile feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

When setting up for sharpening, place the stone on a damp towel for stability, and keep a bowl of water handy to keep the stone wet during the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. A loaf pan or similar object can be used to raise the stone, preventing knuckles from banging into the counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. For an easier and less messy setup, a "sink bridge" can be used to hold the stone over a sink, containing all the mess and providing a constant water source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

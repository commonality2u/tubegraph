Roasting chicken is a popular method for preparing a meal, often served with mashed potatoes, peas, and gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. An unconventional method of roasting chicken can lead to particularly good [[gravy_preparation_from_roast_chicken | gravy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Preparation

A 4-pound chicken is typically used for roasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Scoring the Legs
Scoring the chicken legs with three cuts straight down to the bone can help ensure thoroughly cooked, fall-apart, and crispy drumsticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Seasoning
The chicken should be seasoned generously with pepper and salt, enough to cover both the top and bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The oil and seasoning can be smoothed around the entire chicken while it's in the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Aromatics
Optionally, a piece of lemon, a shallot, and herbs can be placed inside the chicken for added flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Performing all preparation steps directly in the pan minimizes hand-washing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Unconventional Roasting Method: Stovetop Start

One key technique involves starting the chicken on the stovetop before transferring it to the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

1.  **Stovetop Browning**: Place the chicken in a 10-inch skillet with a little olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Turn the heat to medium under the skillet while the oven preheats to 400°F (200°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Cook the bottom of the chicken on the stovetop for about 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
2.  **Benefits**: This method addresses the common issue of white meat finishing before dark meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The [[different_methods_for_cooking_chicken_thighs | dark meat]] (thighs) and the thick part of the breast are on the bottom, receiving direct heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The chicken is cooked on the stovetop until it smells like the bottom is about to burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
3.  **Oven Transfer**: Once the bottom is sufficiently browned, transfer the skillet directly to the preheated oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Using a convection setting is beneficial for [[cooking techniques | roasting chicken]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Mid-Roast Adjustments
Approximately 30 minutes into oven roasting, check the white meat temperature; it should be around 120°F (49°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. At this point, garlic powder can be added to the breast, as applying it earlier may cause it to burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The oven temperature can be slightly increased for the final stretch to help brown the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Doneness and Resting

The chicken is typically done after about 45 minutes in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Target Temperature**: The white meat should reach 160°F (71°C) when pulled from the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The internal temperature will rise to the safe 165°F (74°C) as it rests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. For extra caution, it can be cooked a few degrees higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Resting**: Rest the chicken on a plate to collect its juices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. These juices can then be easily poured back into the [[gravy_preparation_from_roast_chicken | gravy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Resting also allows the chicken to continue cooking to a safe temperature and helps retain moisture.

## Gravy and Fat Utilization

The stovetop pre-cooking creates an "incredible layer of Fond" (browned bits at the bottom of the pan) which is ideal for making [[gravy_preparation_from_roast_chicken | gravy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Roasting at high temperatures evaporates most of the pan juices, leaving behind essentially straight fat for the roux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Fat for Gravy/Potatoes**: Some of this rendered fat can be poured directly into mashed potatoes, replacing some of the butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Gravy Preparation**: The remaining fat in the pan is used to create a roux by whisking in flour to form a thick paste, then cooking it until nutty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Liquids like white wine and water are then added and simmered for 5-10 minutes, allowing the brown bits to dissolve and color the gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The cooked shallot and lemon from inside the chicken can also be added for flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Carving

Carving the chicken is made easier with this method:
1.  **Leg Quarters**: The leg quarters can be easily torn off by hand because they are so well cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, similar to [[airsoft_rotisserie_chicken_method | grocery store rotisserie chickens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The legs can then be cut off the thighs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
2.  **Breasts**: Each breast can be cut off whole for a cleaner cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Removing the bone before roasting can simplify this but is not always deemed worth the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
3.  **Remaining Meat**: Any remaining bits clinging to the carcass can be torn off by hand, suitable for other dishes like chicken pot pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
4.  **Slicing**: Once removed, the breast can be sliced as desired, including against the grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

The pre-cooking of the dark meat allows the breast to be cooked to just done, resulting in very juicy white meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The thigh pulls apart like barbecue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, and the scored legs are well-browned and seasoned, also pulling apart easily due to the scoring allowing faster cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Roasting Methods

Another common [[cooking techniques | roasting technique]] involves roasting the chicken breast side down for the first half of [[cooking techniques | cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. While this method can give [[different_methods_for_cooking_chicken_thighs | dark meat]] a head start, it can be harder to execute and may not yield as good a color as the stovetop-start method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The breast side down method often results in less desirable browning on the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

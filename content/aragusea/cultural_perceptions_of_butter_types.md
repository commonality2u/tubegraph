From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

The perception and use of different butter types, particularly [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | salted versus unsalted butter]], are influenced by historical preservation needs, economic factors, and evolving culinary trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. While a home cook's opinion might be that either type can work with proper adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, the societal dynamics surrounding butter types are surprisingly loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Historical Context and Salt Content

Salt has historically been used as an ancient preservative for various foods, including fish and meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Butter, being derived from milk, naturally contains trace amounts of sodium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The primary reason for adding significant salt to butter was not initially for taste, but for [[preservation_and_fermentation_of_butter | preservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

According to Elaine Kostova, author of "Butter: A Rich History," butter was a natural candidate for salting to extend its shelf life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Exceptions to Salting

In regions like India, butter was preserved differently, by boiling it down to evaporate liquid and create ghee, which prevents bacterial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This method was a practical necessity in the hot Indian subcontinent, as solid butter melts in ambient temperatures above 90°F (32°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Western Tradition and High Salt Content

The Western tradition of solid butter making likely originated in Northern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The Vikings, among the first notable European butter makers, produced butter that was significantly saltier—about ten times as much salt as modern salted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This highly salted butter, which would have been inedible directly, was later soaked in cold water to leach out some of the salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

For context, Land O'Lakes salted butter, a popular brand in the U.S., contains about 1.64% salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Therefore, Viking butter would have contained approximately 16.4% salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, providing the necessary [[historical_use_of_salt_in_butter | preservative power]] for long winters or voyages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Even into medieval times, table butter was likely three times as salty as today's salted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, measuring around 4.9% salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. One hundred years ago, dairy industry publications reported butter with 3% or 4% salt, which was likely the minimum required for freshness without refrigeration for more than a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## The Impact of Modernization

The shift from highly salted butter to today's less salty versions was primarily due to the advent of refrigeration and industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Large-scale, temperature-controlled logistical networks allowed for the delivery of fresh butter to more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

As butter production moved to creameries and factories, a selling point became the reduction of salt, implying that the butter was so fresh it didn't need to cover up off-flavors or rancidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Unsalted Butter as a Status Symbol

This change also capitalized on a long-standing [[cultural_identity_and_dietary_distinctions | cultural notion]] that unsalted butter was fancier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Historically, the French, particularly in regions outside Paris, produced highly prized unsalted, cultured butter, which could be sold for two to three times the price of regular salted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Cultured butter is fermented with bacterial cultures, resulting in a tangy, yogurt-like flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This aligns with the Anglophone world's perception of French goods as high class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

Wealthy families who didn't produce their own butter would contract dairy maids to make small batches of unsalted butter exclusively for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Before refrigeration, unsalted butter that hadn't spoiled was a luxury item because scarcity makes it expensive, and rich people desire expensive things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Culinary Influences

In the 1960s and 1970s, cooking became more sophisticated, with figures like Julia Child and Jacques Pépin introducing the American palate to unsalted butter not just for the table but for [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | cooking]] as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Later, Alton Brown further popularized unsalted butter in home kitchens for the sake of standardization and precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. He taught home cooks to measure by weight and use unsalted butter to better control the salt content in food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Modern Culinary Approaches

Despite the emphasis on precision, particularly in professional kitchens where standardization is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, many home cooks find that using either salted or unsalted butter works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The amount of salt in commercially available salted butter varies within a narrow range (e.g., 80-110 mg of sodium per tablespoon among popular brands) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, making it manageable to adjust the overall salt in a dish.

Ultimately, individual salt perception and preference vary widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. For home cooking, tasting the food as you go, regardless of the butter type, is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Even for baked goods, where raw batters are often tasted for seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[0:10:38]</a>.

Julia Child herself, in her 1961 classic "Mastering the Art of French Cooking," stated:
> "Except for cake frostings and certain desserts for which we have specified unsalted butter, American salted and French butter are interchangeable in cooking." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>

For recipes, authors often specify salted butter because it is far more popular in North America and the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. However, advanced cooks using unsalted butter are generally assumed to be capable of adjusting salt content themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. There is room in the culinary world for both precise, measured cooking and a more intuitive, "feel-it-out-as-you-go" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

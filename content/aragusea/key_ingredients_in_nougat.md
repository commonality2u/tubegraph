Nougat is an aerated confection where air is stabilized by a protein, and the main structure (continuous phase) is a sugar matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Within this sugar matrix, a web of proteins surrounds the air bubbles, making the whipped sugar syrup stable, solid, and stretchy or bouncy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Four primary variables dictate the characteristics of nougat:
*   Air content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   Water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   Kind of sugar used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Kind of protein used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

These variables are crucial in distinguishing nougat from other aerated sugar confections like [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | meringue]] or [[homemade_honey_marshmallows | marshmallow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Proteins
The type of protein used significantly impacts the texture of nougat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Nougat** is typically made with egg protein (albumin) and sometimes soy protein (globulin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These proteins form simpler networks that result in a texture that generally stays compressed when pushed, rather than bouncing back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. At Crown Candy, a mid-sized confectionery, dried egg albumen is a key ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Marshmallow** often uses gelatin, which is a protein derived from boiled animal parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Gelatin creates a squishy, elastic texture that bounces back when pressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This elasticity comes from the gelatin's secondary and tertiary structure, which forms complex helices at junction zones, acting like springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Sugars
The kind of sugar used and its state (crystalline vs. amorphous) are critical for nougat's texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Cane sugar (sucrose)** is a common ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. When sucrose crystallizes, it contributes to a more brittle or "short" texture, like that of a 3 Musketeers bar, which breaks cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The size of these crystals also matters; 3 Musketeers has many small crystals, achieved by adding powdered sugar as "seed crystals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Corn syrup** (or honey in some fancier candies) acts as a "doctoring agent," inhibiting the formation of sugar crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. It's a molecule that gets between sucrose molecules, preventing them from linking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The more corn syrup, the fewer crystals, resulting in a chewier nougat, such as a Charleston Chew, which stretches when pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Inverted sugar**, formed by breaking down sucrose into monosaccharides through heat or acid (e.g., with cream of tartar), can also inhibit crystallization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Factory production often combines different sugars like fructose and corn syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Water Content
The amount of water in a confection directly correlates with its softness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   [[nougat_manufacturing_process | Candy makers control water content]] by boiling sugar syrup to a specific temperature; higher temperatures mean more water has been boiled off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   At Crown Candy, nougat is boiled to 270°F (132°C), resulting in a much firmer product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   In contrast, [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | Italian meringue]] (similar to [[homemade_honey_marshmallows | homemade marshmallow fluff]]) is cooked to about 240°F (115°C), leaving more water and creating a softer, spreadable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   Divinity, a softer southern treat, has syrup cooked to around 250°F (120°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   [[factors_affecting_the_texture_of_nougat | Humidity]] also plays a role, as sugar is hygroscopic (sucks water from the air). Candy makers adjust boiling temperatures to account for ambient moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Air Content
The amount of air whipped into the confection significantly impacts its density and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   Nougat is much denser than marshmallow, with a density closer to 0.9 to 1.0, compared to marshmallow's 0.3 to 0.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   Air helps explain why nougat is a common ingredient in candy bars: "the more air you can so, the more money you make" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Air is free bulk, making products like 3 Musketeers seem larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

All these subtle variations in protein, sugar, water, and air contribute to the diverse textures and forms of nougat found in the world of confections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

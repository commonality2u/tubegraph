Aging [[pizza_dough_preparation | pizza dough]] in the refrigerator for up to a week can result in an "insanely crispy and flavorful" "pizza bread," which is a loaf of bread baked from [[aging_pizza_dough | aged pizza dough]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method simplifies the process compared to traditional sourdough starters or pre-ferments, making it easier to achieve complex flavors and textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Benefits of Aging Pizza Dough

Refrigeration allows the dough to slowly ferment, developing:
*   **Enhanced Flavor:** From bland to yeasty, fermented, and even notes of ripe banana, becoming "funky" and "complex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. After a week, the flavor can be likened to sourdough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Improved Texture:** The dough becomes increasingly crispy on the surface and chewier on the interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The slow cold rise produces a finer, more uniform bubble structure compared to a quick room temperature rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The dough's underside also becomes rougher and more bubbly, holding more oil for crisping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Easier Handling (when cold):** As the dough ages, it becomes gooier and stickier, but when cold, it is stiffer and easier to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## [[Pizza dough ingredients and preparation | Pizza Dough Ingredients and Preparation]]

A standard recipe for a giant batch of [[pizza_dough_preparation | pizza dough]] includes:
*   Warm water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   Sugar (to activate yeast and enhance browning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   Yeast (stirred in warm water and sugar, bloomed for 5 minutes to ensure activity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   Salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Olive oil (about a quarter cup for flavor and to help browning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   Bread flour (start with 10 cups, anticipating more during kneading) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

### [[Best practices for pizza dough preparation | Best Practices for Pizza Dough Preparation]]
*   **Dough Consistency:** [[Preparing and handling pizza dough | Pizza dough]] has better flavor and texture when it's very wet and sticky. Add just enough flour to make kneading possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Kneading:** Knead until the dough can be stretched thin without tearing, which took about seven minutes in the example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Storage Containers:** Use glass containers for long rises to avoid chemical leaching. Coat containers with olive oil, allowing the dough balls to oil themselves in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Portioning:** For consistent results, especially when making multiple portions, weigh the dough. Approximately 300 grams is good for one 12 or 13-inch pizza or pizza bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Refrigeration:** Dough can go directly into the fridge without an initial room temperature rise; it will still rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This is an easy way to make and [[how_to_make_and_store_extra_pizza_dough | store extra pizza dough]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Aging Process Day-by-Day (Cold Rise)

### Day 0 (No Cold Rise)
*   Dough rises on the table for two hours and is baked immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Appearance:** Smooth underside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Texture:** Very soft and pillowy, not crispy, only slightly chewy, with big bubbles on the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Flavor:** Bland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Day 1 (24 Hours Cold Rise)
*   Dough rises significantly in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Appearance:** Underside becomes rougher and bubbly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Texture:** Stiffer and easier to handle when cold. Finer bubble structure, less pillowy, with some crunch and chew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Flavor:** Still a little flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Day 2 (48 Hours Cold Rise)
*   **Appearance:** Dough is a little stickier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Texture:** Still a little pillowy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Flavor:** Starts to smell and taste like beer, with a yeasty fermented flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Day 3 (72 Hours Cold Rise)
*   **Appearance:** Dough is getting really sticky; underside is uneven and bubbly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Texture:** Surface is getting much crispier, possibly due to starches breaking down into simpler sugars that caramelize more readily. A glassy top may appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Day 4 (96 Hours Cold Rise)
*   **Flavor:** A delicious smell like ripe banana starts to be noticeable, both when raw and cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Day 5 (120 Hours Cold Rise)
*   **Appearance:** Dough is looking very gooey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Handling:** All but impossible to handle if not cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Flavor:** Insane, with the ripe banana note, funky, complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Day 6 (144 Hours Cold Rise)
*   **Texture:** The top gets very crispy. The interior becomes much chewier, as the gluten develops itself over time with a wet dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Day 7 (One Week Cold Rise)
*   **Appearance:** Dough is super gooey and sticky. The underside (which will become the top when baked) is very craggy, allowing oil to soak in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Handling:** Hard to handle even when cold due to extreme softness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Texture:** Amazing crispiness on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Flavor:** Sourdough-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Baking "Pizza Bread" (or [[Making New Yorkstyle pizza dough at home | Pizza]])

This method is shown for "pizza bread," which are strips of dough baked with toppings, similar to [[french_bread_pizza_preparation_and_tips | French bread pizza]]:
1.  **Topping:** Coat the surface with plenty of olive oil, grind on pepper, shake over plenty of garlic powder, and sprinkle on a good amount of large, crunchy flaky salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   *Caution:* Be careful not to let the garlic powder burn, as it tastes nasty if it does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
2.  **Preheating:** Preheat a pizza stone for at least half an hour at maximum convection oven temperature (e.g., 550°F / 287°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. A pizza stone is preferred over a pizza steel for this type of bread, as the steel tends to burn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
3.  **Placement:** Drop the dough onto the hot stone. For aged dough with a rough underside, bake it bottom side up to utilize its oil-holding, crisping surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This also helps with the stickiness that makes it difficult to deliver with a pizza peel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
4.  **Baking:** Bake until brown, typically 7 or 8 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
5.  **Cooling:** Pull the bread off with tongs onto a cooling rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
6.  **Serving:** Cut once lengthwise and then into strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

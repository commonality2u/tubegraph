From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Pork is a polarizing meat, being the most popular globally by some reckonings, yet avoided by about a third of humanity, particularly due to religious prohibitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While the specific historical origins of the [[historical_and_cultural_origins_of_the_pork_taboo | pork taboo]] remain without clear scholarly consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, several theories propose health and safety as the underlying reasons for its avoidance.

## Biblical and Quranic References

The Torah, specifically Leviticus and Deuteronomy (written in the first millennium BCE), codifies the [[religious_prohibitions_on_eating_pork | pork taboo]] in Abrahamic religious law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Ancient Jewish law states that pork is forbidden because pigs have a cloven hoof but do not chew their cud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Unlike ruminants such as cows, goats, and sheep, pigs have digestive systems very similar to humans and do not chew cud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, these texts do not explain *why* these characteristics make pork bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The Quran forbids the flesh of swine, along with carrion (rotten meat) and blood, unless one is starving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Carrion and blood are particularly likely to harbor dangerous pathogens and toxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, although these can be killed through cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This grouping led many to assume the prohibition against pork was an ancient health and safety code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## The Trichinosis Theory

This theory suggests that the [[religious_prohibitions_on_eating_pork | pork taboo]] arose from an understanding of diseases carried by pigs.
### Origin and Popularity
The theory gained traction in the 19th century when scientists linked the parasitic disease [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | trichinosis]] to roundworms found in undercooked pork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | Trichinosis]] was prevalent in Europe and the Americas at the time. Intellectuals were eager to reconcile religious teachings with scientific knowledge, and the understanding of [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | trichinosis]] seemed to provide a scientific logic for the Old Testament prohibition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Counter-Arguments
More recent scholarship casts doubt on the [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | trichinosis]] theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. American anthropologist Marvin Harris argued in the 1980s that there is nothing exceptional about pork as a source of human disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>:
*   **Universal hazard**: All domestic animals are potentially hazardous to human health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. For example, anthrax is a severe bacterial infection that herd animals like cattle and sheep can pass to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Ancient people had knowledge of anthrax, which may have been the fifth plague of Egypt described in Exodus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Lack of ancient evidence**: There is no evidence that [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | trichinosis]] was particularly pervasive in the ancient Middle East, nor that ancient Middle Easterners were aware of its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Nature of parasitic diseases**: Meat parasites cause relatively mild illnesses, often asymptomatic, with serious problems unfolding over years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. It would have been difficult for ancient people to link meat consumption to such diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Modern projection**: Harris concludes that the [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | trichinosis]] theory is a case of modern people projecting their own 19th-century experiences onto ancient societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Maimonides' Cleanliness Theory

In the Middle Ages, the philosopher Maimonides, a Sephardic Jewish rabbi serving as court physician to the Islamic ruler Saladin, offered a different reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Around 800 years ago, he wrote that the primary reason for forbidding swine's flesh is "its habits and its foods are very dirty and loathsome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. He argued that allowing pork consumption would make "the streets and houses dirtier than any cesspool," referencing the Franks (Crusaders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

Pigs are notably more visibly "gross" than most farm animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. They are omnivores that eat anything, including trash, roadkill, and even human excrement, and they wallow in mud, potentially their own waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Marvin Harris's Environmental-Economic Theory (linked to cleanliness)

Marvin Harris found Maimonides's reasoning persuasive, proposing an environmental-economic explanation for the perception of pigs as unclean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>:

*   **Pigs and Wallowing**: Pigs do not sweat and have small lungs, making panting ineffective for shedding heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. In hot, sunny climates, their primary way to cool down is by covering themselves in mud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Given the option, they prefer clean mud, but will use their own excrement if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Ancient Middle East Environment**: The ancient Middle East, once forested, underwent deforestation and desertification due to population growth during the Iron Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Wild pigs in forests are less gross, rooting for seeds, nuts, and truffles, and using natural shade instead of wallowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. As the environment changed, pigs increasingly needed to wallow.
*   **Urbanization and Competition**: Urbanization led to thousands of humans living closely, filling streets and dumps with food scraps and human waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Pigs were attracted to these discarded calories. This new context caused people in the Middle East to view pigs, and thus pork, as inherently unclean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Economic Inefficiency**: Furthermore, pigs cannot digest grass and compete directly with humans for grains and similar foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. In the arid Middle East, pigs became both "gross and uneconomical," leading to the [[religious_prohibitions_on_eating_pork | religious prohibitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. In contrast, in ancient Rome or rapidly urbanizing China, pigs were beneficial as they cleaned waste and converted it into protein without significant competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Counter-Arguments to Harris's Theory
*   **Other "dirty" animals**: Goats also eat anything, including poop, but are not forbidden to Jews and Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Chickens**: Chickens, despite living in gross coops and competing for grains, are also not forbidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Chicken Efficiency**: Archaeologist Richard Redding (2015) suggests that chickens may have simply supplanted pork in the Middle Eastern diet because they were more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Chickens can thrive in cramped urban spaces, convert food scraps into protein more efficiently than pigs, produce eggs, and are smaller, making them easier to slaughter and consume entirely before spoilage in hot climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. If this were the case, a religious prohibition might seem unnecessary, as people would naturally choose the more efficient option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

While these theories offer explanations for the pork taboo rooted in health and safety, the historical origins remain uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. It is clear that once the [[religious_prohibitions_on_eating_pork | pork taboo]] took hold, it also served as a means for distinct groups to define and distinguish themselves from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Overview
Establishing aquaculture systems in residential settings involves raising fish for entertainment or consumption, often utilizing existing structures not originally intended for fish keeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A notable example is the conversion of old residential cisterns into active fish habitats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Utilizing Cisterns for Aquaculture
[[raising_fish_in_home_cisterns | Cisterns]], historically one of the oldest human technologies for collecting fresh water, can be repurposed for aquaculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. They were commonly built in areas lacking municipal water mains or clean groundwater, such as a Kentucky suburb south of Cincinnati where Nick Tobler's family home is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Cistern Construction and Water Collection
Typically, cisterns involve gutters on the roof to collect rainwater, which is then directed via pipes into a water-safe containment area, often under the house or garage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Nick's cistern is a large concrete structure under his garage, designed to hold significant volumes of water for household needs like drinking, bathing, and mopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### The "Eel Pit" Example
Nick Tobler, a naturalist and pet shop worker, discovered a large, empty cistern under his garage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. He converted it into a significant aquaculture system he calls the "eel pit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

*   **Size and Volume**: While a typical PVC tank sold for aquaculture might hold 300 gallons, Nick's cistern is estimated to hold 5,000 to 6,000 gallons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Water Level**: Nick maintains the water level at about thigh-level (for a 5'8" person), which is below its maximum capacity carved in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. A higher water level would require raising concrete block islands used for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Nick keeps fish in the cistern as pets and does not plan to eat them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Finding Forgotten Cisterns
Many old houses might have forgotten cisterns, which could potentially be used for aquaculture or simply for water collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Fish Species for Cistern Environments
[[species_of_fish_suited_for_home_cistern_environments | Species of fish suited for home cistern environments]] benefit from the stable, cool, and clean water conditions found in underground cisterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

*   **Nick's Collection**: His "eel pit" houses freshwater American eels, Diamond sturgeon, Albino sterlets, Gar (which resemble alligators), blue crabs (saved from a market), and catfish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Sturgeon**: These fish are difficult to farm commercially due to their need for cool, very clean water, similar to a mountain stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Cisterns, being underground and fed by rain, provide remarkably stable temperatures (40-60Â°F year-round) and pure water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Best Food Fish**: Trout are considered an excellent choice for a cistern setup due to their delicious taste, productivity, and preference for cold water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Most edible fish species thrive in cold water, where they evolve to be larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Catfish are another option for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Maintaining Water Quality and Oxygenation
[[water_purification_and_oxygenation_methods_in_fish_tans | Water purification and oxygenation methods in fish tanks]] are critical for aquaculture systems, especially when maintaining a dense population of fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The primary challenge is preventing fish from self-poisoning with ammonia from their waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

*   **Water Changes**: Nick regularly pumps dirty water out and replenishes it with clean rainwater or, if no rain, a garden hose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Filtration System**:
    *   A plastic tank above the cistern is used to acclimate new fish or grow babies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   Water passes through a filter drum containing bioballs, which provide extensive surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   Beneficial bacteria grow on the bioballs, converting harmful ammonia into nitrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Oxygenation**:
    *   Splashing water as it returns to the cistern is intentional to introduce oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   Several airstones are also used to further oxygenate the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
    *   High oxygen levels are crucial for sturgeon, which require constant water flow over their gills, similar to sharks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Substrate and Plants**:
    *   Plants are generally not recommended in Nick's "eel pit" because sturgeon can get caught and drown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
    *   Additionally, rotting plant matter in a cold, confined space could produce dangerous gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   A river rock substrate is preferred over sand to prevent gas pockets from building up in the enclosed environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Ample gas exchange is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Historical Precedent
Keeping fish in cisterns has a long history, dating back thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The famous Cisterns of Constantinople (now Istanbul) are fabled to have held fish that served as an early warning system for poisoned city water supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Inspiration for Home Aquaculture
Despite historical use, there isn't much public information on individuals raising fish for food in old home cisterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Nick Tobler's "eel pit" on social media (handle "cow turtle" on YouTube and TikTok) aims to inspire others to successfully grow fish like trout or catfish in their own forgotten home cisterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

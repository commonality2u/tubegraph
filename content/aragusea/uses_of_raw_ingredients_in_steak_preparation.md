The "dressing the board" technique is a classic method for flavoring steak, allowing for preparation of seasonings while the meat is cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This method leverages the principle that meat, as it cools, will reabsorb moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Instead of seasoning the steak directly, flavorings are applied to the cutting board, which the cooked steak then rests on and absorbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This process takes advantage of the juices expelled during cooking, allowing the meat to reabsorb them along with the added flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Preparing the Steak for Cooking

Before cooking, only oil is applied to the steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While some salt and pepper can be added at this stage, the concept that immediate salting enhances browning is considered a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. If salting in advance, it should be done at least 40 minutes prior to cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Dressing the Board: Raw Ingredient Application

This technique involves applying raw ingredients directly to the cutting board. When the hot steak rests on these ingredients, its heat softens the herbs, melts the butter, and mellows the raw garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. After slicing, tossing the steak pieces in the accumulated juices and flavors ensures even distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Key Raw Ingredients Used

*   **Rosemary:** Chopped rosemary from the yard is a classic and highly compatible pairing with steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Garlic:** A small clove of garlic is finely grated using a microplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Due to its potent raw flavor, careful moderation is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Citrus:** A small amount of lemon, lime, or even grapefruit juice can add a complementary flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Pepper:** A generous amount of coarsely ground pepper is preferred raw because cooking can cause it to burn on the steak and diminish its pungency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This is why high-end restaurants often offer fresh pepper at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Salt:** Only a small amount of fine salt is added to the board to ensure even distribution throughout the steak slices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The majority of the salt is applied as a coarse finishing salt, providing bursts of concentrated flavor rather than a uniform saltiness, similar to a pretzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Butter:** A couple of slivers of fresh butter are placed on the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The milky taste of fresh butter offers a desirable contrast to the steak's deep flavor, a finishing technique favored by many classic American steakhouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Resting and Serving

A steak cooked for nine minutes total and rested for five minutes will absorb the board's flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The heat from the steak will soften the rosemary, melt the butter, and take the edge off the raw garlic as it rests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. After initial resting, the steak is sliced thin and tossed in the accumulated flavored beef juice, allowing the meat to reabsorb moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For optimal experience, the meat can be allowed to rest a second time to absorb even more liquid and kept warm in a heated bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Serving the steak immediately off the board or on a warmed plate prevents it from getting cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. A plate can be warmed by running it under hot water for a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. A hot plate can even slightly reheat a well-rested piece of meat, a practice common in steakhouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

This method allows for a quick total preparation time, with only 15 minutes from start to dinner including pan preheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Any tender cut of meat can be used with this approach, and even without added flavorings, simply tossing the meat in its own juices is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

While [[benefits_and_characteristics_of_copper_cookware | copper cookware]] is visually appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> and an "incredible heat conductor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, its pure solid form can be "potentially dangerous for others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> due to its chemical properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Chemical Reactivity and Toxicity
Copper is a very [[copper_cookware_and_chemical_reactivity | chemically reactive]] metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Common food acids can "leech copper out of the cookware and into your food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. While copper is an essential micronutrient in our diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, it is "acutely toxic in huge doses and chronically toxic in smaller but still excessive doses over time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Excessive copper intake can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, anemia, and liver and kidney diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## Moscow Mules: A Public Health Concern
The Moscow Mule cocktail is a significant example of copper's potential danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This acidic cocktail is traditionally served in an unlined copper mug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Iowa's Regulatory Action
In 2017, the U.S. state of Iowa garnered headlines by effectively banning unlined copper mugs in bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Their regulation stipulated that only copper mugs lined with an inert material like tin or stainless steel could be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Scientific Confirmation of Leaching
Research supports Iowa's caution. A study published in the journal *Environmental Health*, co-authored by undergraduate students at Carroll College in Montana, demonstrated that a standard Moscow Mule "absolutely can extract dangerous levels of copper from a mug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Interestingly, the ginger beer component, not the lime juice, was identified as the primary culprit for copper leaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. However, it takes "a long time for the drink to leech out a lot of copper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Mitigating Risks with Moscow Mules
If consuming a Moscow Mule from an unlined copper mug, it is advisable to drink it quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This also aligns with the drink's nature, as it is meant to be served "super super cold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Traditional Uses of Copper in Cooking
Despite these [[risks_associated_with_hot_sugar_syrups_in_cooking | risks]], copper has [[historical_and_traditional_uses_of_copper_in_cooking | traditional uses]] in the kitchen and distillery where its reactivity is either beneficial or mitigated.

### Beating Egg Whites
In classical European cooking, unlined copper bowls are traditionally used for beating egg whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Copper ions released from the bowl form complexes with egg proteins (like ovotransferrin or conalbumin), making the foam more stable during beating and cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This results in a quicker stiff peak and a more stable foam compared to stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. A similar effect can be achieved by adding cream of tartar or lemon juice to egg whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Alcohol Distillation
[[use_of_copper_in_alcohol_distillation | Copper vessels]] are traditionally used in alcohol distillation, including pot stills and modern column stills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Copper's affinity for sulfur is key here; it "pulls sulfur out of the distillate when the distillate is in vapor form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, which is particularly beneficial for brandies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, preventing "rotten eggs" flavors from sulfur compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Jam and Sugar Work
Pure copper pots, known as jam pans, are still commonly used for making sweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The high sugar content in solutions appears to prevent copper from leaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Copper heats very evenly, preventing hot spots that could burn or seize sugar, and it heats "super fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, which is crucial for candy making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Importance of Lining Copper Cookware
Due to the health [[risks and safety concerns of smoked foods | risks]] of prolonged contact between acidic foods and copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, copper pans are traditionally lined on the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Historically, tin was used, but stainless steel is now more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. High-quality stainless steel cookware often features layers of copper sandwiched inside to leverage copper's superior thermal conductivity while preventing direct food contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

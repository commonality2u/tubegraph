From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Deboning a turkey involves completely removing the skeleton from the bird before roasting, allowing for easier preparation and carving on the day of a holiday feast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This method simplifies the process, making the hard work anticipatory, and results in boneless meat that is very easy to slice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The bones removed during this process can be used to make a delicious [[making_turkey_demiglace | turkey demi-glace]] or gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

It is recommended to start the deboning process two days before your planned feast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This technique can be applied to any size bird, including large ones like a 20-pound (9 kg) turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Essential Tools
*   Kitchen scissors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   Boning knife or any really sharp knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   Pliers (for removing leg tendons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>

## Steps for Deboning

Before attempting to debone a turkey, it is advisable to have basic knowledge of bird anatomy and to practice by breaking down a few whole chickens (cooked and raw) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### 1. Preparing the Turkey for Deboning
Lay the turkey on your counter with its backbone facing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. There are only four main points where the skeleton protrudes through the meat: the shoulder joints and the hip joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. All other meat simply sits on top of the bones and can be peeled off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### 2. Removing the Main Carcass
1.  **Cut Along the Spine:** Cut straight down along one side of the spine. Let your knife follow the bones, slowly peeling the meat off the central skeleton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
2.  **Dislocate the Hip Joint:** Once you reach the hip joint, use kitchen scissors to get around the joint. Grip down, twist hard to lever the joint around, and dislocate it. Once open, use the scissors to snip away ligaments and other tissues connecting the femur to the pelvic girdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  **Dislocate the Shoulder Joint:** At the shoulder joint, perform the exact same action: use scissors to twist and lever it apart, then snip or cut the ligaments attaching the humerus to the scapula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. On a large turkey, the wing or shoulder joint may be small enough to dislocate by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
4.  **Peel Meat from Ribs and Breastbone:** With both joints on one side cut, continue peeling the meat off the ribs, making small slices and following the bones with your knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Stop when you reach the sternum (breastbone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
5.  **Repeat for the Other Side:** Rotate the bird and repeat the process for the other side, peeling meat off the backbone until you hit the other hip joint, then dislocating it with scissors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
6.  **Free the Carcass:** Continue peeling the breast meat off the ribs and breastbone until the meat from both sides converges. Peel the meat off the sternum and break off the wishbone. The central skeleton or carcass will then be free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Save the carcass, neck, and giblets for making gravy or [[making_turkey_demiglace | demi-glace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### 3. Deboning the Legs and Thighs
1.  **Expose the Thigh Bone (Femur):** Cut straight down to the thigh bone, then peel some meat off its sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
2.  **Remove the Femur:** Slip your knife in and under the femur, sawing out toward where the hip was to free that end of the bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
3.  **Expose and Remove the Shin Bone (Tibia):** Repeat a similar process for the knee and shin bone (tibia). Cut straight down along its length and peel meat off the sides until you can see clearly. Grab the thigh bone, get under with the knife, and saw out toward the ankle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
4.  **Finish Leg Bones:** Once at the ankle, lever the bones over and use scissors to snip off any remaining connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Save all bones for sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
5.  **Remove Tendons:** Large turkeys have significant tendons in their legs that can make the meat inedible. Use pliers to grab the end of each tendon, hold the meat back, and pull hard to extract them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### 4. Deboning the Wings
You can cut off the wings whole and add them to the sauce bones, as there isn't much quality meat on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. If deboning, cut straight down along the humerus (upper portion, or drumette) and peel the meat off the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. You may choose not to debone the winglets or wing tips and save them for sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### 5. Trimming and Preparing the Deboned Meat
1.  **Remove Unwanted Bits:** Inspect the deboned meat for any remaining bits of cartilage or blubbery globs of fat and trim them out, ensuring the final roast is 100% edible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. All trimmings can be saved for sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
2.  **Even Thickness:** Flip back the pectoralis minor muscles (poultry tenderloin) to create a more even thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Butterfly the thickest part of the breast with one or two shallow cuts to help it lie flatter and cook more evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
3.  **Separate Meat (Optional):** A 20-pound deboned turkey may be too large for a single baking tray. You can snip off the leg quarters, as there's typically only skin attaching the breast to the thigh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This allows you to place dark meat on one tray and white meat on another, providing independent control over their cooking, as they cook differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Post-Deboning Curing and Roasting Tips
After deboning, you can perform a quick salt cure or dry brine by applying salt, pepper, and herbs (like dried thyme and sage) to the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Garlic and onion powder can be applied to the underside but may burn on exposed skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Tuck any exposed meat under the skin to prevent it from becoming leathery in the fridge, while allowing the skin to dry out for crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Store raw meat at the bottom of the fridge in case of leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Roast the deboned turkey at 400°F (200°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. While a turkey on the bone might take five hours, a deboned turkey cooks in just over an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

The prickly pear, scientifically known as the *Opuntia* genus, is a cactus with nearly every part being edible and potentially quite tasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While the plant is abundant in the warmer parts of the Western Hemisphere and is very popular in Latin American cuisine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, its consumption might seem unbelievable to those unfamiliar with [[eating_cactus_safely | eating cactus safely]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Identifying and Growing Prickly Pear

The *Opuntia* genus includes hundreds of distinct species native to the Americas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. It can be easily propagated by simply planting any chunk of the plant in the ground, which will then send out roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The plant was named after the city of Opus in ancient Greece, which was rumored to have an edible plant that could be grown this way, although the prickly pear itself is almost certainly not the plant Theophrastus wrote about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Edible Components and Harvest Times

Two main edible parts of the prickly pear are:

*   **Tuna (Fruit)**: These are true fruits, or berries, that grow from the outer leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. In Spanish, "tuna" is a word of indigenous American origin applied to the cactus fruit, unrelated to tuna fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. They have soft, sweet, and sour flesh with a pulpy core of small seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Tuna generally ripen in the fall, but can still be found ripening in winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. They are ripe when they are no longer green and twist almost effortlessly off the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Nopales (Paddles/Pads)**: These are the flat, fleshy "leaves" of the cactus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The best nopales are typically the new growth paddles that sprout in the springtime, which are lighter green and more tender than mature ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Both the tuna and nopales are edible but are best at different times of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Hazards of Prickly Pear: Glochids

Beyond the obvious large spines, prickly pear cacti possess insidious, nearly microscopic thorns called glochids (or glochidia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. These barbed hairs hook into the skin and break off when removed, leaving painful tips embedded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. They can cause a minor but sharp pain when pressure is applied and a generalized dull aching or dermatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Some people may have a stronger reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Brushing carelessly against the plant can result in being covered in millions of glochids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Removing Glochids

To remove glochids, researchers in the 1980s found success by immediately removing the exposed part of the glochid with tweezers and then applying household glue, letting it dry, and ripping it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## [[harvesting_and_preparing_prickly_pear_fruit | Harvesting and Preparing Prickly Pear Fruit]] (Tuna)

It is highly recommended to use tongs when harvesting the fruit to avoid contact with glochids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Twisting the fruit is the preferred motion for removal, rather than pulling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Although some botanical texts suggest ripe fruits drop their glochids, wild prickly pears may still be covered in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Methods for Removing Glochids from Fruit

*   **Scrubbing**: Some people use tongs to hold the fruit under running water and scrub it vigorously with a stiff brush, then rinse multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This may be more effective for store-bought varieties, which often have fewer glochids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Rolling in Sand**: An ancient indigenous method involves vigorously rolling the fruits in sand, which theoretically dislodges the prickles before washing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Burning (Traditional Method)**: A traditional and highly effective method is to singe the glochids off with fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This can be done over a gas stove burner or a campfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Care must be taken not to keep them in the heat too long, or they will burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. After burning, wash them off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Processing the Fruit

Once glochids are removed, the skin can be peeled off. It may be easier to trim the blossom and stem ends first, as the skin tends to stick around those areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Using a fork to hold the fruit upright and filleting off the skin with a knife is an effective method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

The fruit tastes "purple," with a generic fruity flavor and a slight vegetal taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Less ripe fruits are more acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The seeds are very hard and cannot be crunched through like papaya seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Due to the limited amount of fruity flesh and numerous seeds, the fruit is often juiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The fruit can be mashed by hand or blended with a little water to help it flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The juice is then strained to remove seeds and pulp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

Juiced tuna can be boiled down to make [[alternative_dessert_recipes | candies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, or used to make a soft drink called *agua fresca de tuna* by stirring in simple syrup and lime juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## [[preparing_nopales_for_consumption | Preparing Nopales for Consumption]] (Paddles)

Store-bought nopales often have only the large, conspicuous thorns that can be easily shaved off with a knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. However, wild nopales may also have many glochids, requiring them to be burned off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Shaving off the skin with glochids is not ideal, as they can become stuck in the sticky flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Nopales are filled with mucilage, a gluey polysaccharide similar to what makes okra slimy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The slime is generally not an issue when eaten raw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Nopales have a flavor that can be described as a "fruity tasting vegetable," akin to sour green beans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Harvesting pads in the morning can result in a lower acid content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

When cooked, the slime can become more unpleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. In Mexican cuisine, nopales are often boiled, then strained and washed to reduce the slime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. When well-prepared, they make a very tasty taco filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Mozzarella is widely recognized as the best cheese for pizza. A 2014 study indicated that only mozzarella, or a mozzarella-based cheese blend, provides the desired browning and stretching characteristics expected of pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. However, mozzarella comes in several forms, each with distinct properties that affect the final pizza.

## Fresh Mozzarella

Fresh mozzarella, historically originating from Italy and often made from water buffalo milk, is characterized by its softness, high moisture content, and milky quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[01:00:00]</a>. It is sweet, fresh, and subtle in taste, often described as solidified milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>. Its most significant characteristic for pizza making is its wetness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

Fresh mozzarella is difficult to shred because it's too soft and smooshes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. When used on a [[New York style pizza | New York style pizza]] (wide, thin, with a solid sheet of cheese), it tends to make the crust unappetizingly soggy due to its high water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Ideal Use: Neapolitan Style Pizza

Fresh mozzarella is best suited for [[Neapolitan vs New York style pizza cheese preferences | Neapolitan style pizza]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Unlike [[New York style pizza | New York style pizza]], Neapolitan style uses much less cheese, applied in splotches rather than a full sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[02:02:51]</a>. This style of pizza is typically baked in very hot ovens, around 700°F (370°C) convection, which helps prevent sogginess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[03:03:05]</a>.

## Low-Moisture Part-Skim Mozzarella (LMPS)

Low-moisture part-skim mozzarella was developed in the United States after World War II, particularly in dairy-producing regions like Wisconsin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[03:03:28]</a>. American cheesemakers sought an alternative to fresh mozzarella, which was too wet, soft, messy, and not shelf-stable for commercial mass production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[03:03:40]</a>.

### Manufacturing Process

This cheese is often referred to simply as "pizza cheese" in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[03:03:57]</a>. Its moisture is removed chemically, not physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[05:05:12]</a>. The process involves:
*   Standardizing milk to a lower fat content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[04:04:07]</a>.
*   Adding rennet (an enzyme that coagulates milk) and specific bacterial cultures to ferment lactose, dropping the pH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[04:04:14]</a>.
*   Heating the curd in a cooker stretcher to about 60°C (a pasteurizing step) to inactivate bacteria and enzymes, extending shelf life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[04:04:24]</a>.

This process results in a firmer, more stable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[04:04:01]</a>. The acidification (from bacterial fermentation by brands like Grande, or vinegar by brands like Paesana) gives low-moisture mozzarella a sharper taste than fresh mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[05:05:22]</a>.

### Impact on Pizza

When used for [[New York style pizza | New York style pizza]], low-moisture part-skim mozzarella provides:
*   Nice browning on the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[04:04:45]</a>.
*   A crispy and dry crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[04:04:49]</a>.
*   A firmer cheese with a slight snap when cooled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[04:04:51]</a>.
*   The more acidic qualities crucial for [[New York style pizza | New York style pizza]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[06:06:03]</a>.

## Whole Milk Low-Moisture Mozzarella (WMLM)

A further distinction within low-moisture mozzarella is between part-skim and whole milk varieties. Many [[New York style pizza | New York style pizza]] makers prefer whole milk low-moisture (WMLM) mozzarella for its rich flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[06:06:09]</a>.

### Challenges and Availability

WMLM is harder to find in grocery stores compared to part-skim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[06:06:23]</a>. This is due to a few reasons:
*   **Grease Layer**: Higher fat content can result in a grease layer on the pizza, which some general consumers may not prefer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[06:06:29]</a>.
*   **Machinability**: Removing fat makes the cheese firmer and easier to cut and shred by machine, which is beneficial for large-scale manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[06:06:42]</a>.

Despite these challenges, many prefer the flavor of full-fat cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[07:07:03]</a>. It can sometimes be found at deli counters (e.g., Boar's Head brand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[07:07:13]</a>. Historically, some full-fat low-moisture mozzarella was sold in string cheese form, like Galbani sticks, which was considered excellent for pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[07:07:31]</a>. In the US, Walmart sometimes carries a whole milk low-moisture mozzarella option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[09:09:01]</a>.

## Medium Moisture Mozzarella

Some retail mozzarella products, such as a full-fat Paesana brand sold in stores, fall into a "medium moisture" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[08:08:26]</a>. This type is softer and wetter than true low-moisture mozzarella and is not the same as the commercial loaves sold to pizza shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[08:08:41]</a>. It can cause issues like excessive rising and boiling over in the oven, leading to a wet pizza with an unappealing flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[08:08:30]</a>.

## Pre-Shredded Mozzarella

Pre-shredded mozzarella offers convenience but comes with a significant drawback: it contains anti-caking agents like corn starch, potato starch, and calcium sulfate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[09:09:30]</a>. These agents prevent the cheese from clumping in the bag but can interfere with melting and browning during baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:55">[09:09:55]</a>.
*   They may not melt at pizza baking temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.
*   They can act like a batter, preventing the outer surface of the cheese from melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[10:10:10]</a>.
*   They can soak up moisture released during baking, making the cheese surface too dry, which leads to toasting or burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[10:10:20]</a>.

While it is possible to make a good pizza with pre-shredded cheese, consistency can vary widely between brands due to differences in the amount of anti-caking mix used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[10:10:45]</a>.

Ultimately, for pizza, even small differences in ingredient quality, particularly cheese, can lead to significant variations in the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[11:11:12]</a>.

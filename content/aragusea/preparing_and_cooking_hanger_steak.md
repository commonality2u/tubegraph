From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

The hanger steak is a lesser-known cut of beef, sometimes called the "butcher's cut" or "butcher's steak" because butchers historically kept it for themselves due to its excellent flavor and unique preparation requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. There is only one hanger steak per animal, making it somewhat difficult to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

It comes from just above the diaphragm of the animal, above the brisket on the top side, and is known for its extremely beefy taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Hanger steak from a younger animal will be more tender, while that from an older animal will have a beefier flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Preparation

Hanger steak requires some specialized knife work before cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. If frozen, it can be thawed in a bowl of cool tap water, which may take around 40 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Trimming Silver Skin
The first step is to trim off the "silver skin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This is a rubber band-like connective tissue that will not melt during cooking and must be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
It helps to use a very thin, sharp knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. A useful technique is to get a strip of silver skin started, pull up on it, and then shave through the rest, removing as little meat as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. It is important to avoid trimming off any fat, as it is delicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Removing Central Connective Tissue
Hanger steak also contains a central band of connective tissue that runs straight through the middle of the meat and is extremely chewy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
While you can cook the steak whole and then carve off this tissue after resting, it is often preferred to remove it before cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This allows for separate treatment of the two sides, as they are not the same size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. To remove it, slowly "unzip" the meat along the seam of the connective tissue, cutting right along the white part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

### Portioning and Butterflying
Once separated, the two halves of the hanger steak will resemble tenderloins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Smaller piece:** This can be cut in half to create two pieces of more consistent thickness, suitable for pan roasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Bigger piece:** This can be roasted or grilled whole, or butterflied into thinner steaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. To butterfly, slice the meat to half its thickness, stopping before cutting all the way through, and then open it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Shallow cuts can be made to help it lay flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This technique is associated with French bistros, where hanger steak (called *onglet*) is a classic cut for steak frites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Cooking

Before cooking, season the hanger steak pieces with salt, pepper, and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Pan-Roasting Thicker Pieces
For thicker pieces, such as the "loin-like" cuts from the hanger, use a lower heat to avoid burning the fond in the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   Cook on medium-low heat, frequently rolling the meat around until a decent crust forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   Begin butter basting, either with a spoon or by continuing to flip the meat in the butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This creates an omnidirectional heat that helps cook thicker cuts through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   A thermometer can be used to judge doneness, or you can "poke and peek" by snipping a small piece with scissors for examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

### Searing Thinner Steaks
For thinner, butterflied hanger steaks, use a hot pan to achieve a golden crust without overcooking the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   A good indicator for cast iron pan temperature is when the residual oil just begins to smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   Flip the steak frequently, every 30 seconds or so, to build a gradual crust and ensure more even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   The coarse grain of hanger steak makes it easy to visually assess doneness by looking for pink juice pooling in the grooves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. A good amount of juice surfacing indicates medium-rare to medium doneness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

### Doneness
Hanger steak is tender, but not as tender as tenderloin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. It can be cooked to medium-rare or medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Remember that [[carryover_cooking]] means the internal temperature will continue to rise after the steak is removed from the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Resting and Slicing
After cooking, let the hanger steak rest for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. It is crucial to slice hanger steak thin and against the grain to ensure it is tender and not chewy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Slicing on the bias (at a shallow angle) can yield prettier, wider slices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Serving with Sauce

Hanger steak has a strong beef flavor and may not require a marinade or extra flavoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. However, its wide open grain structure is excellent for holding onto a pan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

### Pan Sauce for Hanger Steak
Traditionally, pan sauces are less common for steak than for other meats because the high heat needed for searing can burn the fond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. However, with thicker cuts of hanger steak cooked at a lower heat, the fond can be preserved for a delicious sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

#### Ingredients
*   **Shallots:** Classic allium for pan sauces due to their thin layers, which cook quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   **Red Wine:** Used for deglazing the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. As an alternative, water followed by a splash of balsamic vinegar can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **Demi-Glace:** Optional, but a great addition for richness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Butter:** Stirred in off the heat to create a thick, luscious emulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. If not using demi-glace, more butter can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Parsley:** Fresh parsley can be torn in at the last second to wilt without turning brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

#### Method
1.  After removing the cooked steak, saut√© chopped shallots in the pan until brown and soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
2.  Deglaze the pan with red wine, scraping up the fond with a wooden spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
3.  If using, add demi-glace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
4.  If the sauce looks over-reduced, add water instead of more wine to prevent bitterness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
5.  Turn off the heat and, once bubbling has stopped, stir in butter to form an emulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
6.  Pour any juices from the resting meat board into the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.
7.  Add fresh parsley if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
8.  Spoon the sauce over the sliced hanger steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

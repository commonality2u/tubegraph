From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

A pot roast is considered a monarch's meal that is both cheap and easy, requiring primarily time for preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This version aims for deep and complex flavors through strategic lid removal during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Essential Equipment & Setup

A large Dutch oven is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The burner should be set to medium, and the oven preheated to 350째F (approximately 180째C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Meat Selection and Preparation

The classic choice for a pot roast is a thick steak of chuck, also known as beef shoulder, weighing between 2.5 to 3 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This cut is tough but rich in collagen, which melts during [[cooking_techniques_for_less_tender_cuts | slow-cooking]] to become unctuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It also possesses a near-perfect amount of fat for braising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Fat Trimming

Chuck roasts often contain a large, concentrated "nut" of fat in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. It is advisable to remove some of this fat at the initial stage if you wish to limit the amount of melted fat in the finished gravy, as the final sauce will be too viscous to easily skim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. There's no need to worry about mangling the meat, as it will eventually be torn into chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Browning the Meat

Use a tiny amount of oil to start, as the meat will quickly melt out its own fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It's generally not necessary to season the meat at this stage, as it will be thoroughly covered in sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Browning Temperature

Contrary to some recipes, browning meat for braises on high heat is often ill-advised unless the pan is very crowded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. A superior finished product is achieved by browning on medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Burned flavors created at the bottom of the pan will spoil the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The meat will brown sufficiently on medium heat; it just requires time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The meat is ready to flip when it can be peeled off the surface without excessive sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. If exposed areas of the pan appear to be burning, move the meat to cover those parts to divert heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The meat can be removed even if not perfectly browned on all sides if the "fond" (browned bits on the bottom) is at risk of burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Building the Sauce Base

### Vegetables

*   **Onion**: Cut a large onion into thin quarter circles. These strands contribute to the structural mesh of the finished gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Celery**: An optional addition; cut into very small pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Add the onion and celery to the pan after removing the meat to give them a head start; they do not need to be fully soft as they will cook for hours with the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Thickening and Flavoring the Sauce

*   **Tomato Paste and Flour**: If the fond threatens to burn, add a generous squeeze of tomato paste and up to a quarter cup of flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Stir well to disperse the flour and allow the tomato paste to brown, which adds incredible depth and intensity to stews and sauces, even those not intended to be overtly tomato-flavored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Wine**: When burning seems imminent, add a couple of cups of red wine (up to half a bottle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Beef can be braised with white wine, but the combination of red wine and tomato is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Tomatoes**: Incorporate a quality 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The sauce will transform during cooking and will not taste like simple tomato sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Less or no tomato can be used if preferred, substituting with beef stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Worcestershire Sauce**: A significant amount provides a meaty flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Soy sauce can be an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Garlic Powder**: Ideal for this application as it rehydrates in the sauce, providing substantial umami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. It is preferred over fresh garlic for convenience and effect here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Pepper**: Add a little pepper; salt can be saved for the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Combining Ingredients

Return the meat and any accumulated juices to the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Gently stir to coat the meat. The liquid may appear thick, but the meat will release a significant amount of water during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Cooking Process

Place the lid on the Dutch oven and transfer it to the preheated oven at 350째F (180째C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Accompaniments

*   **Potatoes**: Bake 5 Russet or large Yukon Gold potatoes (or a mixture) alongside the pot roast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. They are done when easily pierced with a fork, typically after about 1.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Mashed Baked Potatoes**:
    *   Melt a generous amount of butter (e.g., 7 ounces or almost 2 sticks) on medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Peel and chop about half a head of garlic and add it to the melting butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Turn off the heat and let the garlic gently cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   Once potatoes are cool enough to handle, scoop their flesh into a ricer and extrude directly into the butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. A ricer provides the smoothest texture for mashed baked potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   Season with salt, a generous amount of milk, and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Stir to combine and homogenize the texture as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Heating the milk beforehand is not found to make a discernible difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Baked potatoes achieve a more intense, caramelized flavor than boiled ones due to higher cooking temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Rosemary**: Fresh rosemary adds a "cozy" flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Pick leaves off stems and chop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Integrating Carrots

After approximately 2.5 hours of total cooking time, when the meat is tender but possibly still uneven, return it to the oven for another hour or so to reach a melt-in-your-mouth consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

*   **Carrots**: Use about a pound of large carrots to ensure they cook evenly al dente <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Cut them into pieces of roughly equal mass despite varying girth; longer pieces near the tip, progressively shorter toward the stem end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Remember they will shrink, so cut them larger than desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   Add carrots to the pot once the meat is almost done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Get them wet with the sauce but don't submerge them completely, as they benefit from some dry heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Uncovered Cooking**: A key "game changer" for pot roast is to cook it uncovered for the final hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Although the sauce may seem thick, the carrots will release a lot of water, balancing it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Some burning around the rim is acceptable if it allows the meat to brown on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   The carrots should be tender enough to pierce with a fork after about an hour of uncovered cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Total cooking time for the roast should be 3.5 to 4 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Finishing Touches

After the total cooking time, add last-minute flavorings:
*   A pinch of salt, as the only salt previously was from the Worcestershire sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   A shot of vinegar (e.g., balsamic) to "wake things up" and counteract the dullness of long-cooked flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   Fresh pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   Chopped rosemary, added at the end to keep its green color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Shredding and Serving

For a pulled texture, stir the meat first, which will cause it to begin falling apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Avoid over-agitating to prevent it from becoming "cat food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Dissolve any burned edges into the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Finally, pull any remaining large chunks of meat into bite-sized pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

Serve the pot roast with a generous pile of mashed potatoes, which are excellent for soaking up extra sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Focusing on one main vegetable in the pot roast ensures it cooks to the perfect consistency, preventing mushiness that can occur with multiple vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The meat will be covered in melted collagen and fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, and the sauce, transformed by long, partially dry cooking, will be dark, sweet, and unlike simple tomato sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The pot roast reheats well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

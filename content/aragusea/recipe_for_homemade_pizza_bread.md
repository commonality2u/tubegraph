Every time pizza is made, a loaf of [[creating_pizza_bread_with_aged_dough | pizza bread]] is prepared, which is a favorite food for children and adults alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Ingredients
*   One aged dough ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>
*   Olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>
*   Pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>
*   Coarse salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
*   Garlic powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>

## Preparation
1.  Take an aged dough ball that has spread out nicely and flat in a wide container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
2.  Observe the spongy, bubbly surface on the dough, which will become very crispy in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
3.  Gently stretch the dough into a big oval shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
4.  Flip the dough so the original bottom side becomes the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
5.  Smear a generous amount of olive oil onto this porous surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
6.  Sprinkle with pepper, coarse salt, and garlic powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Baking
*   Bake the [[creating_pizza_bread_with_aged_dough | pizza bread]] in the oven using the same [[baking_techniques_for_pizza_at_home | baking techniques]] as for pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   It is ready when the top just begins to color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Careful: Garlic powder can burn easily, so a very light brown is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The spongy surface should crisp up nicely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Serving
*   Cut the [[creating_pizza_bread_with_aged_dough | pizza bread]] into small strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. While larger chunks are an option, strips are often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

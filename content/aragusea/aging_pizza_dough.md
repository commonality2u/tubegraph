Aging pizza dough in the refrigerator for an extended period, such as a week, can transform its texture and flavor, resulting in a crispy and flavorful [[creating_pizza_bread_with_aged_dough | bread]] that some call "pizza bread" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method simplifies the process compared to traditional techniques using sourdough starter, biga, or other pre-ferments, making it an easy way to achieve complex flavors through refrigeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Benefits of Cold Rising

The primary benefit of aging dough in the fridge (cold rise) is the development of flavor and texture that is not achievable with a quick room-temperature rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. A slow cold rise creates a finer bubble structure, distributing the air among a larger number of smaller bubbles, which is often preferred for pizza crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The dough also becomes easier to handle when cold due to its stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Basic Pizza Dough Recipe for Aging

To begin, prepare a large batch of standard [[pizza_dough_ingredients_and_preparation | pizza dough]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Ingredients
*   Warm water: ½ cup + 4 cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Sugar: 2 teaspoons + 2 tablespoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> (enhances browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>)
*   Yeast: 2 teaspoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   Salt: 2 tablespoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Olive oil: approximately ¼ cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> (helps dough brown at home oven temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>)
*   Bread flour: 10 cups (start with, may add more during kneading) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

### [[pizza_dough_preparation | Preparation]] Steps
1.  **Activate Yeast**: In ½ cup warm water, dissolve 2 teaspoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of yeast. Stir and let bloom for five minutes to confirm yeast activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This step can be skipped if you're feeling adventurous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  **Combine Wet Ingredients**: Add 4 more cups of water, 2 more tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of salt, and about ¼ cup of olive oil to the yeast mixture. Stir well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
3.  **Mix in Flour**: Start with 10 cups of bread flour and mix as much as possible with a spatula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
4.  **Knead the Dough**: Get in with your hand to continue mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Add just enough flour to make kneading possible, as wetter and stickier dough yields better flavor and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Knead until the dough can be stretched thin without tearing, which took seven minutes in one instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
5.  **Prepare for Storage**: Use glass containers to avoid chemical leaching during the long rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Coat each container with olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
6.  **Portion Dough**: Use a food scale to weigh dough portions for consistency; approximately 300 grams is suitable for a 12 or 13-inch pizza or one "pizza bread" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Use each dough ball to oil its container, coating the dough in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
7.  **Store**: Cover the containers securely, ensuring the yeast has enough air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Label samples and place them directly into the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. It's not necessary to rise the dough at room temperature before refrigeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Day-by-Day Aging Observations

### Day 0: No Cold Rise
*   **Preparation**: Let dough rise on the table for two hours, then bake immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The underside of the dough looks smooth, identical to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Baking**: Coat the surface with olive oil, grind pepper, shake garlic powder, and sprinkle large, crunchy flaky salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Preheat pizza stone for 30 minutes at maximum convection oven temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Bake until brown, about 7-8 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Results**: Shows large internal bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The flavor is bland, and the texture is very soft and pillowy; it's not crispy and only slightly chewy, resulting in an inferior product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Day 1: 24 Hours Cold Rise
*   **Dough State**: Dough rises significantly in the fridge despite being placed in straight away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The underside is rougher and bubbly, which helps it hold more oil and become crispier in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It's easier to handle when cold because it's stiffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Baking**: Bake at 550°F (or oven's maximum) until brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Results**: The bubble structure is finer compared to Day 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Flavor is still a bit flat, but the texture is less pillowy, gaining some crunch and chew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Day 2: 48 Hours Cold Rise
*   **Dough State**: The dough is a little stickier and begins to smell faintly like beer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Baking**: Be careful not to burn the garlic powder, as it happens easily and tastes nasty if scorched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Results**: Texture is still slightly pillowy in a negative way, but the flavor is improved, showing a yeasty, fermented taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Day 3: 72 Hours Cold Rise
*   **Dough State**: Dough becomes very sticky, and the underside is noticeably uneven and bubbly, ideal for holding oil and baking up crisp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Baking**: Bake the dough bottom side up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It's often easier to drop the dough onto the stone than use a pizza peel due to the oil making it stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Results**: The surface becomes much crispier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This increased crispiness may be due to starches breaking down into simpler sugars during fermentation, which caramelize more readily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A glassy top starts to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Day 4: 96 Hours Cold Rise
*   **Dough State**: A delicious smell, similar to ripe banana, starts to become noticeable in both the raw and cooked dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Day 5: 120 Hours Cold Rise
*   **Dough State**: The dough appears very gooey. If not cold, it would be nearly impossible to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Results**: Despite being slightly underbaked in one example, the flavor is exceptional, featuring the ripe banana note, making it funky and complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Day 6: 144 Hours Cold Rise
*   **Dough State**: The top of the dough becomes extremely crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Results**: The interior of the dough is significantly chewier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. For a wet dough, gluten development occurs sufficiently over time, effectively "kneading" the dough for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Day 7: Full Week Cold Rise
*   **Dough State**: The dough is super gooey and sticky, impossible to handle if not cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The underside, now the top, is extremely craggy, allowing oil to soak in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Toppings**: Be cautious with pepper, as its spice is more pronounced in this aged dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. A good coating of garlic powder is recommended; it provides an umami taste distinct from fresh garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Big, flaky salt is essential for texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The dough is so soft at this point that even cold, it's hard to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Baking**: Bake for seven or eight minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. A pizza stone is preferred over a steel for this type of bread, as the steel tends to make the bottom black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Results**: The top is incredibly crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The flavor is deeply complex and can be described as akin to sourdough, as the process effectively creates a form of sourdough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This method is an easier alternative to maintaining a traditional sourdough starter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

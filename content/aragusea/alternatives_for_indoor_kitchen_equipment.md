## Pancake Batter Preparation
While pancake batter can be made in nearly any vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, a 1-quart Pyrex measuring jug is recommended for its ability to go directly into the microwave for melting butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. When mixing ingredients like sugar into melted butter, a fork works just as well as a whisk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Cooking Surfaces
Pancakes can be cooked on various surfaces, offering different advantages:

### Nonstick Skillet
A standard 10-inch nonstick skillet is a widely available option for cooking pancakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, and is easier to use than stainless steel to avoid sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. When using a round pan, it can function like a mold, allowing batter to spread into a tidy circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Stainless Steel Pan
Pancakes can be cooked in a stainless steel pan, though this may require using extra butter to avoid sticking and cooking the first side slightly longer, resulting in a darker color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Flat Square Griddle Pan
For cooking multiple pancakes, especially for children, a cheap flat square griddle pan is a useful specialized [[kitchen_tools|tool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. On a square cooking surface, it is more geometrically efficient to cook many small pancakes rather than a few large ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This contrasts with a round pan, where small pancakes are less efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Electric Tabletop Griddle
For cooking a large quantity of pancakes simultaneously, a big, wide electric tabletop griddle is the best option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Many models are available for under one hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Pancake Flipping and Handling
Flipping pancakes can be challenging, but several methods exist:

### Spatula Challenges
A normal home [[kitchen_tools|kitchen spatula]] may be too small for a 10-inch pancake, especially in a pan with a raised edge, causing the pancake to bend or break when flipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This often necessitates waiting until the bottom side is very solid, which can lead to burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Air Flipping
Many people who make large pancakes in pans opt to flip them in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This technique allows for flipping before the pancake is solid enough for a spatula, potentially preventing it from becoming too dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. It requires confidence, as hesitation can result in insufficient force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Small Pancakes
Small pancakes are much easier to cook and flip, often only requiring bubbles forming around the edge or the edges gaining a matte finish as an indicator for flipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. If small pancakes merge, they can be cut apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. A griddle pan with a short rim also simplifies spatula use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Keeping Pancakes Warm
When cooking multiple pancakes, maintaining warmth for later servings can be a challenge:
*   **Warm Oven**: Placing a cooling rack with cooked pancakes into a warm oven can help keep them warm while more are cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Multiple Pans**: Using several pans simultaneously allows for cooking multiple pancakes at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Batter Dispensing
To achieve perfectly round pancakes:
*   **Measuring Cup**: Scooping batter out with a small measuring cup can result in almost perfectly round pancakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Pancake Batter Dispenser**: While specialized batter dispenser tools with a valve at the bottom are sold for perfectly round pancakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, they are generally only effective with thinner batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Thick batters, as preferred, do not flow evenly through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Post-Cooking Care
*   **Cooling Rack**: Transferring cooked pancakes to a cooling rack is highly effective for improving their quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This allows steam to escape, preventing condensation and sogginess that would occur if they were left on a plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Powdered Sugar Application**: For serving with powdered sugar, a small shaker cup or a sieve can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

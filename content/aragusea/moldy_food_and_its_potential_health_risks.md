From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Moldy food is generally considered unsafe to eat, with varying degrees of risk depending on the type of food and mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While consuming a large amount of mold all at once could cause severe sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, eating a small amount might not have immediate effects unless you are allergic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, scientists believe that repeated consumption of small amounts of mold over many years could lead to serious health issues, including cancer, kidney, and liver disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

The majority of food safety experts advise against risking it and recommend throwing out moldy bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Understanding Mold

### What is Mold?
Molds are a type of fungi, similar to [[Culinary myths about cooking mushrooms | mushrooms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Unlike plants, fungi do not photosynthesize; instead, they consume existing organic matter, similar to animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Molds are considered smaller, distant cousins of [[Culinary myths about cooking mushrooms | mushrooms]], sharing many molecular similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Dr. Megan Bianco Daniels, a mycologist specializing in food spoilage, compares [[Culinary myths about cooking mushrooms | mushrooms]] to trees, with distinct parts like roots, trunks, and leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Molds, in contrast, are more like green algae, consisting mostly of threads of fungal cells without significant tissue specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### [[mold_structure_and_how_it_spreads | Mold Structure and Growth]]
The visible part of mold on food is often just the "tip of the iceberg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Molds are primarily composed of microscopic threads called hyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, which form an interconnected network known as the [[mold_structure_and_how_it_spreads | mycelium]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This [[mold_structure_and_how_it_spreads | mycelium]] can spread extensively through soft foods like bread, often resembling gluten strands and being difficult to see with the naked eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Molds grow by releasing enzymes into their environment to dissolve nutrients from the food, then absorbing these nutrients to continue growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### How Mold Spreads
For reproduction, molds produce spores, which are typically found on the surface of the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. These spores are easily carried away by air currents or animals, seeking new wet and nutrient-rich environments to grow into hyphae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Common Mold Species
Mold species are incredibly diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Common types found on bread include blue-green molds like *Penicillia* or *Cladosporium*, and black/gray molds such as *Rhizopus* or *Mucorellis* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Less commonly, *Aspergillus* may also be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Mold spores are resilient and can remain dormant in the environment for extended periods, awaiting suitable conditions to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Health Risks of Mold

### Immediate vs. Chronic Exposure
Eating a large amount of mold could cause immediate illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. If you accidentally eat moldy food and don't experience immediate symptoms like vomiting or paralysis, it likely wasn't highly toxic, or you didn't consume enough to cause acute sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. However, repeated exposure to small amounts of mold over time can lead to chronic health problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Allergic Reactions
Inhaling mold spores can make people sick, especially if their immune system overreacts, leading to allergic reactions or asthma in some individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### [[mycotoxins_and_their_effects_on_health | Mycotoxins]]: The Hidden Danger
Molds produce secondary metabolites, which are chemical compounds not essential for their basic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. When these secondary metabolites are toxic to humans, they are called [[mycotoxins_and_their_effects_on_health | mycotoxins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. [[mycotoxins_and_their_effects_on_health | Mycotoxins]] are bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. They can cause acute toxicity in humans and lab animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

[[mycotoxins_and_their_effects_on_health | Mycotoxins]] are not only found in the visible spores; they are produced by the [[mold_structure_and_how_it_spreads | mycelia]] (the main body of the mold) that spreads throughout the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It is also possible for [[mycotoxins_and_their_effects_on_health | mycotoxins]] themselves to migrate beyond the mold's body into the rest of the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This migration is more likely in soft or wet foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

Chronic exposure to small amounts of [[mycotoxins_and_their_effects_on_health | mycotoxins]] over time has been linked to various health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. They can suppress the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to other diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. [[mycotoxins_and_their_effects_on_health | Mycotoxins]] can also damage DNA, potentially leading to cancer, and harm organs responsible for filtering food and drink, such as the liver, kidneys, and spleen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Difficulty Quantifying Risk
It is challenging for scientists to determine precisely how dangerous mold on food is, especially regarding long-term effects like liver cancer from chronic [[mycotoxins_and_their_effects_on_health | mycotoxin]] exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This is due to the multitude of other environmental factors people are exposed to throughout their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

There is significant concern for individuals in developing countries who rely heavily on one or two staple grains that might be contaminated with [[mycotoxins_and_their_effects_on_health | mycotoxins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Hot, humid climates common in these regions are conducive to fungal growth, and sanitary grain storage conditions may be lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Occupational exposure, such as for mill workers who breathe in spores all day, is also a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## [[food_safety_tips_for_mold_prevention | Food Safety Recommendations]]

### Soft vs. Firm Foods
The U.S. Department of Agriculture provides specific [[food_safety_tips_for_mold_prevention | recommendations]] for handling moldy foods:
*   **Soft foods** (e.g., bread, yogurt, soft cheeses, soft fruits, and vegetables): If moldy, throw them away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The [[mold_structure_and_how_it_spreads | mycelia]] and potentially [[mycotoxins_and_their_effects_on_health | mycotoxins]] can easily spread unseen through their soft, open structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Firm foods** (e.g., carrots, firm cheeses, dry-cured meats): You can likely cut away the moldy part, along with an adjoining inch, and the rest is probably safe to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The interior of these more solid foods is less likely to be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Intentional Molds in Food
Some cheeses are intentionally inoculated with mold, such as blue cheese or the molds on Brie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. These molds are deliberately cultivated and domesticated by humans for favorable flavors and appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. These specific strains have a "down regulation" of the secondary metabolites that lead to off-flavors and potential [[mycotoxins_and_their_effects_on_health | mycotoxins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Even with these intentional molds, some individuals may still have adverse reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### Preventing Mold Growth
To minimize the risk of mold growth on susceptible foods, keep them wrapped tightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Mold spores are airborne, and once they land, mold needs air to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Sealing foods away from air can make them last longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. However, as long as nutrients are available and the food is not too acidic, mold will eventually appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

This recipe details an approach to create a [[traditional_southern_fried_chicken_recipe | traditional Southern pan-fried chicken]] as easily as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It emphasizes specific techniques for seasoning and using buttermilk to achieve optimal flavor and texture.

## Chicken Preparation for Frying
For optimal [[traditional_southern_fried_chicken_recipe | fried chicken]], a small bird, ideally three to three and a quarter pounds, is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Pre-cut chicken pieces from grocery stores are often from larger, older birds, which are less ideal for frying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The chicken should be cut into at least eight pieces of similar size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, such as two breast pieces, two thighs, two legs, and two wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Initial Seasoning of Chicken
Chicken pieces are seasoned aggressively with a generous amount of salt and pepper, followed by onion powder, garlic powder, and cayenne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The seasoning is applied to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, and any leftover seasoning on the board is mopped up by the chicken pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Dried sage and thyme can be added for an herbal note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Buttermilk Brining and Coating
While some methods involve [[seasoning_and_dry_curing_chicken | dry curing chicken]] in seasoning for a few hours for a crispy skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, a preferred method for Southern-style [[traditional_southern_fried_chicken_recipe | fried chicken]] is brining in buttermilk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Instead of mixing seasoning into the buttermilk and submerging the chicken, the seasoned chicken pieces are placed into a Ziploc bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Just enough buttermilk (around half a cup) is poured in to coat the pieces in a thick paste of seasoning and buttermilk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This method achieves the same flavor while wasting significantly less seasoning and buttermilk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The chicken is then brined in the refrigerator for a full 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, resulting in appropriately salty pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Buttermilk Substitute Experiment
It is possible to approximate buttermilk by adding a splash of vinegar to regular milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This substitute was tested on a separate leg piece, brined in its own baggie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
Upon tasting, while the real buttermilk leg tasted slightly better, the difference was subtle and might not be noticed without a direct comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Breading Techniques
Before breading, the chicken is removed from the fridge to warm up, which helps it cook evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

The breading mixture consists of 2 cups of flour, a teaspoon of salt, a heaped teaspoon of baking powder, and ground pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Baking powder is considered a "magic ingredient" as it makes the crust light and crispy rather than cakey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Cayenne can also be added to the flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Garlic and onion powder are *not* added to the flour, as they burn easily, and their flavor is protected underneath the outermost crust layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

The breading process involves two coats:
1.  **Primer Coat:** Chicken pieces are scraped against the bag to remove excess buttermilk drips, then placed into a container with the flour mixture and shaken to coat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. These are then removed to a rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
2.  **Top Coat:** An egg is cracked into the remaining buttermilk and seasoning paste in the bag and beaten with fingers to combine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. All chicken pieces are returned to this bag to get an even, thin coating of this "egg sludge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. They are then shaken again in the flour mixture to coat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

After breading, the pieces are left to sit on a rack for a good half-hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This step, referred to as "wedding," allows the flour particles to hydrate in the egg and buttermilk, helping the crust to adhere during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

Bolognese sauce is a versatile dish that can be made in large batches and freezes well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The preparation involves specific [[cooking_techniques | cooking techniques]] for both vegetables and meat to achieve a rich, deeply flavored sauce.

## Preparing Vegetables

The sauce begins with a substantial amount of vegetables, which contribute to its sweetness and heartiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Carrots
A whole pound of carrots is used to make the sauce sweet and hearty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   **Preparation:** The skins are bitter and should be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Root ends also need to be cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   **Dicing Technique:** To dice carrots, cut them in half, then into long thin slices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Lay the slices flat and cut them into matchsticks, then cut across the matchsticks to create a fine dice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Efficiency Tip:** For larger quantities, a food processor can be used, ideally by breaking carrots into chunks before processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The fineness or perfection of the dice is not critical as they will cook for hours and break down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Onions
One large red onion is typically used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Food Processor Use:** When using a food processor for onions, cut them into a few chunks beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Processing one half at a time can prevent large pieces from spinning uncut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Frying Vegetables
The prepared vegetables are fried in olive oil on high heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. They contain a lot of water, which prevents burning as long as they are kept moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The goal is to give them a head start on [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] until they shrink down and become soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, after which they are removed from the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Preparing Meat

The sauce incorporates three pounds of ground meat, commonly beef chuck, though leaner options like sirloin or even lamb can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The fat content is often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Mashing and Browning
This is considered the most crucial and labor-intensive step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Mashing:** Use a wooden spoon to mash up the ground meat vigorously while stirring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This prevents the formation of small "meatballs" in the sauce, which would be difficult to break up later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Initial Cooking:** After about five minutes, the meat will appear gray and swimming in liquid, which is mostly water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Continue cooking on high heat, keeping everything moving to prevent sticking and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Browning:** As the water evaporates, the sound in the pan changes from hissing to roaring and crackling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This signifies that the meat bits are starting to fry in their own rendered fat, turning from gray to brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This browning step significantly enhances the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Secret Ingredient: Chicken Livers
A pound of chicken livers is a key addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Preparation:** Process the chicken livers in a food processor to a consistency just past a pate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Addition:** Stir them into the meat towards the end of the browning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Avoid overcooking the liver, as it can become gritty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Impact:** The livers make the sauce taste meatier without imparting a liver flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Deglazing and Combining
*   **Tomato Paste:** Stir in a six-ounce can of tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Deglazing:** Be careful as the "carpet of brown stuff" (fond) stuck to the bottom is about to burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Pour in a whole bottle of white wine and scrape the bottom of the pot thoroughly to release the flavorful browned bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Reintroducing Vegetables:** The previously fried vegetables are added back into the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Tomatoes:** Add three 28-ounce cans of good-quality crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Broth:** A big spoonful of liquid chicken bouillon is added for saltiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Simmering and Seasoning

The sauce is brought to a burbling heat and cooked for three hours, stirring every 15 minutes to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Herb and Flavor Addition
After about two hours of simmering, herbs and other flavorings are added:
*   **Herbs:** Approximately a tablespoon each of dried basil, dried parsley, and dried oregano, with slightly less dried thyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Dried herbs are generally better for long-cooked dishes and are best added during the last hour of cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Garlic & Pepper:** A good amount of garlic powder and plenty of pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Balsamic Vinegar:** About 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar is added for a sweet and sour note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The vinegar can be added whenever the sauce is hot, as the heat will boil off its harsh scent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Final Adjustments
After the full simmering time, the sauce will be thick and rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Taste and adjust seasoning with additional balsamic vinegar and salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Sauces should be seasoned strongly, as their flavor will be diluted by other food components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Serving and Storage

*   **Serving:** Serve with pasta, fresh herbs (like parsley), grated cheese, and a drizzle of raw olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Cream Variation:** For a variation, spoon some sauce into a pot, drizzle in heavy cream, and boil until thickened, then add pasta and fresh basil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Freezing:** Once cooled, the sauce can be frozen in ice cube trays for easy portioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Transfer frozen cubes to a large Ziploc bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Reheating:** To reheat, microwave desired cubes until thawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Add a little more balsamic vinegar while hot to brighten the flavor after freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This allows for a deeply flavored, slow-simmered meal in about 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

The best [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] videos on YouTube may surprisingly be infomercials for high-sodium dehydrated broth products, featuring British celebrity chef Marco Pierre White (MPW) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite MPW appearing to "barely be bothered to try anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, one can learn great things about [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] and life from watching him half-heartedly smear a steak with a bouillon cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Marco Pierre White's Influence on Culinary Status

In the English-speaking world, the United States is one of the few places where Marco Pierre White has not been a major pop culture figure for nearly 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. He never achieved the breakthrough success there that his one-time protégé, Gordon Ramsay, did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. However, many credit MPW with initiating today's global celebrity chef movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. He is arguably "patient zero" for this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Prior to Marco Pierre White, [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] was seldom considered a high-status profession, often likened to laundry work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Anthony Bourdain frequently discussed this, stating that the iconic photos by Bob Carlos Clarke, released in 1990, transformed the perception of both chefs and the culinary trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. MPW, described as a "wire thin Jackrabbit of relentless obstinate culinary perfectionism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, may have been driven by his difficult upbringing (dyslexic child of an alcoholic working-class widower, beaten down by the English schooling system) to demand respect as a young chef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. As he ascended the English social ladder, he seemed to elevate his entire profession alongside him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

While this interpretation of history might be "a bit overblown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, as there were celebrity chefs before him, none were as media-savvy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. British media embraced White as their "bad boy friend" because he was "mean to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. His "volatile genius persona," which Gordon Ramsay would later imitate into self-parody, appears to have been deliberately cultivated or invented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Evolution of Culinary Style

The early videos of Marco Pierre White showcase the cuisine that earned him three Michelin stars as the then-youngest chef ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. These dishes, such as caramelized pears with honey ice cream, appear dated and "positively Baroque," often featuring "about 15,000 garnishes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The elaborate presentations, including a sugar bird's nest, exemplify "gilding the lily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Decades later, in his [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] videos for Knorr, the stock cube manufacturer, MPW's style is vastly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This later Marco has no time for "sugar bird's nests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, focusing only on his sponsor and the food he genuinely enjoys, like a rib of beef and Yorkshire puddings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. He is portrayed as "lazy and occasionally just wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## MPW's [[kitchen_techniques_for_beginners | Kitchen Techniques]] and Explanations

Marco Pierre White exhibits a repetitive explanation for sautéing onions: "cooking them without colour just to soften them to remove the water content within them to remove the acidity to bring out the natural sweetness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. While onions are not particularly acidic (pH 5-6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, he is likely referring to their pungency, which comes from sulfur compounds that break down with heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

This demonstrates a broader phenomenon where experienced practitioners, when asked to teach, know what works but may not fully understand *why* it works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. For example, his explanation for whisking liquid into a roux — "to incorporate air into it by incorporating their you break down the starch" — is likely incorrect, yet the technique itself works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. His indifference to accuracy or coherence is seen as a charming trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

> It's worth noting that MPW's false confidence can be infuriating, especially in light of his controversial statement in an interview with the Irish Independent that men are better in professional kitchens because "they are not as emotional and they don't take things personally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Philosophy of Cooking

Regardless of personal opinion on MPW, there are lessons to be learned from his approach. His current unconcern with impressing anyone with his food, despite being a supremely accomplished chef, offers a valuable insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. A significant breakthrough in one's own [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] can come from stopping the constant effort to impress others, which can be a selfish motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This shift allows for a more gratifying journey of discovering what one, and those around them, truly enjoy eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

Marco Pierre White emphasizes finding balance in what you like, suggesting that [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] shouldn't just be a recipe but "a philosophy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. His advice is to "taste your food" repeatedly until you like it, acknowledging that even then, it might not be perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This process takes practice and self-discovery, akin to learning about oneself in intimate relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Becoming a person who understands themselves is often the first step toward becoming desirable to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Practical [[cooking_techniques | Cooking Advice]]
> MPW's advice on selecting meat, stating that a "coating of fat around the eye of the meat... tells you what's in the meat" and "if there's no fat coating you might as well... gobbled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, is incorrect. A better indication of what's in the meat is to look *at* the meat itself, as a steak is by definition a cross-section of muscle; if there's no marbling, there's no marbling, regardless of external trimming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

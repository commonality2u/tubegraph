This article discusses the cultural influences on the consumption and production of cider, highlighting its historical evolution, linguistic distinctions, and societal impacts, particularly within the United States.

## Terminology Differences and Cultural Identity
In most English-speaking countries, "cider" refers to a delightful, relatively low-alcohol, fizzy drink made from apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, in the United States, "cider" denotes a non-alcoholic, non-fizzy apple product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The alcoholic, fizzy version is known as "hard cider" in the US, a segment of the alcohol market that has been rapidly growing for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The highly filtered and refined version is called "apple juice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This distinction of three products—hard cider, cider, and apple juice—is a unique feature of United Statesian English, not typically found among other anglophones, with the possible exception of some Canadians under US influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Historical Evolution of Apple and Cider Terminology
Historically, the word "apple" itself did not always refer specifically to the fruit we know today. In English and many Indo-European languages, "apple" was once a generic term for virtually any fruit or edible bulbous plant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This linguistic heritage explains why the French refer to potatoes as "pomme de terre" (apple of the earth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The term "apple" was used generically in English as recently as the 17th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

The apple species *Malus domestica* has been popular in Britain since at least Roman times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Romans spread domesticated varieties, and subsequent Germanic settlers and French-speaking Normans further introduced varieties to Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. British growers cultivated both "dessert apples" for eating and "cider apples" specifically for juicing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term "cider" and its etymological roots have historically always referred to an alcoholic beverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Its lineage traces back to the Hebrew word "shekhar" (strong drink or intoxicant), translated into Latin as "sikara," then to "cedro" in Italian, "sidra" in Spanish, and Old French before becoming "cider" in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The earliest record of "apple juice" is from early modern English, suggesting the non-alcoholic product was not commonly described with a dedicated term in Middle English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## The Natural Tendency of Apple Juice to Ferment
Apple juice naturally ferments and becomes alcoholic, arguably its "natural state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Apples are inherently covered in yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. If unwashed apples are pressed into juice and left untreated, they will likely become a weak alcoholic beverage within a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Historically, people allowed this fermentation to occur, making the drink safer by controlling harmful bacteria through alcohol content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This fermented apple drink was nutritious, tasty, and often safer than local water supplies for the average peasant, and it had a low enough alcohol content to be given to children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Thus, until very recently, "cider" historically meant an apple-based alcoholic drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Cider in Colonial America and its Decline
When English colonists arrived in New England, they found a climate highly suitable for orchards and planted both dessert and cider apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The Pilgrims, for instance, even used an iron screw from their cider press to brace a broken beam on the Mayflower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, indicating their intent to produce alcoholic cider.

Alcoholic apple cider became a staple of the Anglo-American colonial homestead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. It was consumed by children and used to make [[cultural_and_historical_uses_of_vinegar | apple cider vinegar]] for food preservation and cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Colonists also converted cider into stronger drinks like applejack, created by freezing cider in frigid winters to concentrate the alcohol as water freezes out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

The [[impact_of_prohibition_on_the_cider_industry_in_the_us | temperance movement]], particularly fervent among descendants of English Puritans, eventually led to [[impact_of_prohibition_on_the_cider_industry_in_the_us | Prohibition]] in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. While beer largely survived [[impact_of_prohibition_on_the_cider_industry_in_the_us | Prohibition]], the "hard cider" industry was completely wiped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Post-Prohibition Resurgence and Terminology
From the ashes of the defunct alcoholic cider industry emerged "sweet cider," which was unfermented apple juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The industrialization of America's food system then introduced "highly filtered and refined cider," marketed as "apple juice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. To differentiate, the cloudy, unfiltered equivalent came to be called "cider" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

When Americans rediscovered their appreciation for alcoholic cider and began producing it commercially again, they started calling it "hard cider" to distinguish it from the "sweet" or "soft" cider that had by then become simply "cider" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The convention of using "hard" for alcoholic beverages and "soft" for non-alcoholic ones is a unique feature of American English, dating back to the colonial period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This usage may have descended from an older British English feature describing harsh-tasting drinks as "hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Johnny Appleseed
The mytho-historical figure of Johnny Appleseed is credited with planting apples across the American continent, where they are not native <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. There is a historical debate about whether his intent was for future generations to eat the apples or to produce alcoholic drinks like applejack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

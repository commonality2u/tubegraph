Rosti is a national dish of Switzerland, particularly in German-speaking regions, often served as a breakfast item or side dish, essentially a potato pancake [00:00:00]. While its core ingredients are simple—potatoes, salt, and fat [00:00:07]—there are many subtle [[differences_in_rsti_preparation_techniques | differences in technique]] [00:00:10]. Various potato types can significantly impact the final texture of the dish.

## Potato Varieties Tested

### Yukon Gold Potatoes

Initially, Yukon Gold potatoes were used for several rosti preparations [00:01:00]. This variety is described as being halfway between a waxy potato and a mealy potato [00:10:02]. Waxy potatoes tend to hold their shape when cooked, while mealy potatoes do not [00:10:07].

*   **Parboiled Method**: When parboiled, Yukon Golds developed a slightly fluffy texture in the center, nearing the consistency of [[advantages_of_mashed_baked_potatoes | mashed potatoes]] [00:02:36].
*   **Raw Method**: When used raw and unrinsed, the interior could be a little slimy due to wet starchy residue [00:05:04].
*   **Rinsed Raw Method**: Rinsing raw Yukon Golds improved the interior texture, making it not slimy, though it impacted crispiness [00:06:28].

The thin skin of Yukon Gold potatoes means there is "zero point in peeling" them for rosti, as the skin is nutritious and unlikely to be noticed in the finished dish [00:00:51].

### Russet Potatoes (Mealy Potatoes)

Russet potatoes, characterized as "mealy potatoes" or "baking potatoes," were also tested [00:09:42]. Unlike Yukon Golds, these were peeled due to their "very thick cardboardy skins," which would be unpleasant in the interior [00:09:47].

When Russets were prepared using the rinsed and baked method, their mealy nature became very apparent. The interior of the rosti became "straight [[advantages_of_mashed_baked_potatoes | mashed potatoes]]" and "totally fallen apart" [00:10:21]. It was noted that there was "no point in grating these" as one could have "just fried some [[making_mashed_potatoes_with_garlic | mashed potato cakes]]" [00:10:26].

### Combination of Russet and Yukon Gold Potatoes

For a larger, final rosti, a mixture of Russets and Yukon Golds was used due to availability [00:10:38]. This combination was prepared using the rinsed, seasoned, pan-fried, and then baked method [00:10:45]. This final version, while still affected by thickness in terms of clean slices, yielded a very nice color and texture [00:11:15].

## Considerations for Potato Preparation

*   **Peeling**: While peeling is traditionally recommended for rosti [00:00:46], it is unnecessary for thin-skinned varieties like Yukon Golds, which offer nutritional benefits with the skin on [00:00:51]. Russets, however, benefit from peeling due to their thick skins [00:09:47].
*   **[[using_parboiled_vs_raw_potatoes_for_rsti | Parboiling vs. Raw]]**: [[using_parboiled_vs_raw_potatoes_for_rsti | Parboiling potatoes]] before grating them dries them out, meaning there is less excess water to squeeze out [00:01:13]. Raw potatoes, in contrast, release a significant amount of water when squeezed [00:02:50].
*   **[[impact_of_rinsing_potatoes_before_cooking | Rinsing]]**: [[impact_of_rinsing_potatoes_before_cooking | Rinsing grated potatoes]] removes free starch, which can prevent a "slimy" interior texture [00:05:25]. However, this starch also acts as a binder and contributes to a crispy surface, so removing too much starch can make the rosti less cohesive and less crispy [00:05:49]. A quick dip to remove most free starch is suggested as a compromise [00:07:57].

Despite the [[differences_in_rsti_preparation_techniques | variations in technique]] and potato types, the differences between the resulting rostis were "not enormous," and "every version... was pretty good" [00:11:57]. Ultimately, cooking potatoes for rosti can be flexible, and the outcome will "probably be fine" [00:12:02].

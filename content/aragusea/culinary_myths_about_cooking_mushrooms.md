From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

One common culinary myth, particularly from classical French culinary dogma, is that getting mushrooms wet is the worst thing one can do to them, as it supposedly waterlogs them and dilutes their flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This belief has led to the traditional cleaning method of simply brushing off dirt from mushrooms, rather than washing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

However, this idea is largely considered "silly" because mushrooms will squeeze water back out when they cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The popularity of the [[wet_method_of_cooking_mushrooms | "water trick"]] for cooking mushrooms, which involves cooking them in a little water instead of oil, is seen by many as a satisfying repudiation of this questionable historical advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Mushroom Structure and Cooking

A mushroom's structure is comparable to a piece of bread, being a fibrous network that encloses water and mostly air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This foamy structure is finer and harder to see in mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The entire mushroom is made of tiny threads called hyphae, densely interwoven to appear solid, but with significant empty space between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Conventional Method of Cooking Mushrooms with Oil

When cooking mushrooms using the [[conventional_method_of_cooking_mushrooms_with_oil | conventional method with oil]], the spongy structure of the mushroom absorbs the oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Initially, cooking goes well, producing nice brown color and flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. However, the oil quickly disappears as it diffuses into the mushroom's cavities, leading cooks to add more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

After a few minutes, the hyphae network starts to break down, releasing internal water, which causes the pan to spit as water hits the hot oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Since mushrooms shrink significantly when cooked, a large initial pile means the pan can become flooded with water, causing the temperature to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Browning cannot occur in water; one must wait for all the water to evaporate to achieve color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

The result of this cookery is "undeniably delicious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. To avoid a fully collapsed, dense texture, it's advised to start hot and fast to get color before water comes out, then cook until mushrooms shrink by about half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. At this point, some cavities remain, resulting in a more pleasant texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Wet Method of Cooking Mushrooms (Water First)

The [[wet_method_of_cooking_mushrooms | wet method]] involves using a thin film of water in a hot pan in place of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Water acts as an effective thermal interface, preventing sticking and rapidly distributing heat, causing mushrooms to cook down quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

**Benefits:**
*   Less messy, as it avoids the spitting stage of oil-based cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

**Drawbacks:**
*   Water can only reach 100 degrees Celsius before evaporating, which is not hot enough for browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   Mushrooms must be cooked until their spongy hyphae structure collapses and most of their water has evaporated before oil can be added for browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This often results in [[textural_analysis_and_characteristics_of_cooked_mushrooms | overcooked]] mushrooms that have shrunk significantly (more than half) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   The texture tends to be a little leathery, as the method often overcooks the mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. While fungal cell walls, reinforced with chitin, are more stable at high temperatures than plant cell walls (pectin), they can still collapse to an unpleasantly dense texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Textural Differences and Oil Absorption

A raw mushroom slice floats in water due to its airy cavities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   A conventionally sauteed mushroom slice does not float but sinks slowly, suggesting some air cavities remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   A mushroom slice cooked first in water then browned in oil sinks immediately, indicating its internal cavities have fully collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This supports the hypothesis that the [[wet_method_of_cooking_mushrooms | wet method]] leads to a more complete collapse of the mushroom's internal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

The common belief that [[conventional_method_of_cooking_mushrooms_with_oil | conventionally sauteed mushrooms]] absorb "way too much oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> may not be entirely accurate. While mushrooms do absorb a significant amount of oil initially, they also squeeze some of it back out as they cook and shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Resisting the temptation to add more oil can lead to the pan feeling greasy again by the end of cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

Both [[wet_method_of_cooking_mushrooms | methods]] of cooking mushrooms work, and the results are very similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

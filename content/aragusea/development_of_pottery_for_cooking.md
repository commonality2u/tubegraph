The [[historical_evolution_of_human_diet_and_cooking | history of human diet and cooking]] began not with elaborate dishes, but with simple, dry-heat [[cooking_techniques | cooking techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Early human ancestors, such as Homo Erectus, around hundreds of thousands of years ago, likely cooked food by jamming it directly into a fire, an [[early_methods_of_cooking_and_roasting | early method of roasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, the true revolution in [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] came with the advent of wet [[cooking_techniques | cooking methods]], such as boiling and stewing, which allowed for greater nutrient extraction and the softening of tough foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The archaeological record for these early wet [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] methods is scarce because the materials used often decayed quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Early Wet Cooking: Stone Boiling

Around tens of thousands of years ago, a significant advancement emerged: the use of hot rocks to boil food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This method, known as "pot boiling," involved dropping hot stones into a water-safe container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Before the [[invention_and_evolution_of_cooking_vessels | invention of fire-safe cooking vessels]], early humans improvised containers from materials like animal hides, animal stomachs, or woven baskets lined with clay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Anthropologist John Speth observed in 2015 that flammable materials like animal hide could hold water directly over a fire without burning, as the water prevents combustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Archaeological evidence suggests that Neanderthals ate wet-cooked food as early as 50,000 years ago, indicated by a boiled barley grain found in a Neanderthal's teeth in modern-day Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The process of stone boiling could be achieved by digging a hole, lining it with a large leaf (like a banana leaf), adding water, and then carefully transferring hot, smooth river cobbles from a fire into the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Repeated heating and rapid cooling cause stones to develop a characteristic cracking and glazing pattern known as "crazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Crazed river cobbles appear in the archaeological record around 30,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This [[history_of_food_boiling_techniques | method of cooking]] persisted into the era of written history and is still practiced by some today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### [[Significance of stone boiling | Benefits of Stone Boiling]]

Stone boiling offered several advantages:
*   **Nutrient Extraction**: It allowed for greater nutrient extraction from food, as nothing dripped into the fire and was wasted; nutrients were preserved in the broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Food Softening**: Tough foods could be softened into a form that was easier to chew and digest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Feeding More People**: Wet-cooked foods like soup could feed more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Nixtamalization**: Scientists believe stone boiling might have accidentally led to the invention of nixtamalization in ancient America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. By boiling corn with limestone "pot boilers," the resulting alkaline water could nixtamalize the corn, removing its waxy hull and making amino acids more bioavailable, preventing nutritional deficiencies like pellagra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## The Dawn of Pottery

While effective, stone boiling in perishable containers had obvious disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The next major leap in the [[invention_and_evolution_of_cooking_vessels | evolution of cooking vessels]] was the creation of pottery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Clay, a common material in river basins formed by the chemical weathering of rock, is moldable when wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Early humans likely discovered clay while digging for other purposes, realizing its plastic properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### From Mud to Ceramic

The process of making pottery involved:
1.  **Molding**: Wetting and working the clay (similar to modern "wedging") to make it smooth and plastic, removing air bubbles and large impurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This was significantly easier than carving bowls from rock or wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
2.  **Drying**: Letting the molded clay dry in the sun, perhaps on leaves to prevent sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. While dry clay is hard, it will dissolve in water, leading to a muddy broth and the eventual disintegration of the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
3.  **Firing**: The crucial step was firing the clay at extreme high heat, which chemically transforms it into a ceramic that is hard and won't dissolve in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This likely happened accidentally at first, perhaps by attempting to accelerate drying with fire or by leaving a dried pot in a cooking fire until it fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

The first kilns would have been simple pits. A dried pot, preheated to prevent cracking, would be placed in a pit fire and fully encased in glowing coals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

### Archaeological Evidence and Impact

While pottery was once thought to have been invented 5,000 to 10,000 years ago in much of the world, fragments found in a Chinese cave in 2012 date back 20,000 years, representing the oldest known true ceramic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

Clay pots became the primary type of [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] vessel for a long time, extending through the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and into the early modern period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Although [[history_of_cast_iron_cookware | metal]] eventually proved superior due to its thermal conductivity and resistance to cracking, it remained prohibitively expensive for most families until relatively recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Thus, the ceramic pot was a simple, effective, and ubiquitous solution to a universal need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

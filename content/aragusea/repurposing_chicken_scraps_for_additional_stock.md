From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

For those looking to be especially frugal, leftover bones, skin, and other scraps from a cooked chicken can be repurposed to make a second, flavorful stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Process

1.  **Brown the Scraps**
    *   Take the bones, skin, and other remaining scraps from the cooked chicken and brown them off in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
    *   This step is important because much of the flavor will have already been extracted into the initial [[how_to_make_basic_chicken_soup | chicken soup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Browning helps to compensate for this flavor loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
2.  **Simmer**
    *   Throw the browned scraps into a pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
    *   Simmer for a couple of hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
3.  **Strain**
    *   After simmering, strain the liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Characteristics and Uses

While this secondary stock may not have the same fresh taste as a stock made with unbrowned chicken (as used in [[using_whole_chicken_and_giblets_for_stock | initial stock preparation]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, it still offers plenty of flavor and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

This stock is excellent for making a stew. Ingredients such as whole grains (like farro), vegetables, butter, and herbs can be added to create a hearty meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

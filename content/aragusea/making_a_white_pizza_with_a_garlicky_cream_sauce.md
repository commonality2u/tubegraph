From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Traditional white pizza sauces are often based on ricotta cheese, which can result in a bland flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. An alternative approach is to use a rich, garlicky cream sauce that offers a more distinct flavor profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Pizza Dough Preparation

This recipe utilizes a standard [[pizza_dough_preparation | pizza dough]] recipe.
The key steps for [[pizza_dough_preparation | pizza dough preparation]] include:
*   Blooming yeast in warm sugar water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   Adding more water, sugar, salt, olive oil, and bread flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   Mixing the ingredients until the dough is smooth and elastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   Dividing the dough into individual balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Placing each ball into its own oiled container, covering it, and immediately placing it in the fridge for a long, slow cold rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The dough used in this recipe was [[aging_pizza_dough | aged for almost three days]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Oven Preheating

Before tossing your dough, preheat your oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. If using a pizza stone, heat it with the oven at 550Â°F (convection) for a full hour before baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Garlicky Cream Sauce Preparation

This sauce recipe is designed for one 12 or 13-inch pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Ingredients
*   4-5 cloves of garlic, finely chopped (approximately 24 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Hard cheese, grated (Pecorino Romano is recommended for its acidity, which mimics tomato sauce; Parmesan can also be used). Aim for a pile about the same size as your garlic pile, roughly 20 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   Butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>
*   Heavy cream (also known as double cream), approximately 151 grams or half a cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   Pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

### Method
1.  In a pan over medium heat, melt a little butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A nonstick pan is easier to clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
2.  Add the chopped garlic to the butter and cook until it just begins to turn golden, before it burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
3.  Cover the pan with a good layer of heavy cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
4.  Bring the cream to a boil, then immediately turn off the heat and allow it to cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It's important to wait until the bubbling has mostly stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
5.  Grind in some pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Do not add salt, as the cheese provides enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
6.  Add the grated hard cheese. Pull the pan off the heat to be safe, as adding hard cheese to a boiling sauce can cause the proteins to overcoagulate and become grainy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
7.  The sauce has the perfect texture when it leaves a trail when a spatula is dragged across the bottom of the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This sauce is essentially an alfredo sauce that can be used on pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
8.  As the sauce cools, it will stiffen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. To achieve a very thin layer on the pizza, mix in some fresh cream to thin it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The goal is to get the sauce as thin as physically possible due to its richness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Use a silicone spatula like a putty knife to spread it thinly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. You may not need the entire recipe's worth of sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Assembling and Baking the Pizza

1.  Stretch out your dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Use cornmeal on the peel to prevent the dough from sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
2.  Spread the thinned garlicky cream sauce evenly over the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
3.  Add cheese. For a traditional New York-style flavor and texture, use whole milk, low-moisture mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
4.  Place the pizza on the preheated pizza stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
5.  Be particularly careful not to overcook the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. If the sauce gets too hot, the fat will separate and form a yellow grease layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Finishing Touches

*   Rest the cooked pizza on a cooling rack to help keep it crispier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   After the pizza has cooled for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, chop a stick or two of rosemary and sprinkle it on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This adds color contrast to the white pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   The residual heat in the cheese will soften the rosemary slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Waiting a few minutes before adding ensures the rosemary won't instantly brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

The result is a gooey, cheesy, and garlicky white pizza that is a pleasant change from tomato-based sauces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Hershey chocolate, a favorite in America, often evokes a strong, negative reaction from people in other parts of the world, with many describing its taste as akin to vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This distinct flavor profile has led to it dominating the U.S. market, influencing other American chocolate brands to imitate its taste, which American consumers have come to expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The history and science behind this taste raise questions about how food quality, especially for pleasure-driven items like desserts, is defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Role of Milk in Chocolate History

For much of its 4,000-year history, chocolate was consumed as a beverage by ancient Mesoamericans, often for medicinal or ceremonial purposes, potentially including fermented cacao for alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Europeans, introduced to chocolate via the Aztecs, also used it as medicine due to its bitter, unsweetened taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The addition of sugar transformed chocolate into a pleasure drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Milk was then added to water-based cocoa drinks to smooth texture and round off bitter flavors, similar to its use in coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The development of solid chocolate products in the 19th century initially involved cocoa powder (solids), cocoa fat (butter), and sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Milk was eventually incorporated for similar reasons, as early dark chocolates were often described as gritty and harsh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Incorporating Milk into Solid Chocolate

Adding liquid milk directly to solid chocolate is problematic because milk is mostly water, which doesn't mix with fat and can lead to microbial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The solution came with the development of dehydrated milk.

*   **Powdered Milk**: Henry Nestlé, founder of the Nestlé company, developed a process for creating powdered milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. His neighbor, Daniel Peter, then added this powdered milk to his solid chocolate mix, marking a historical milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Cadbury in England also initially used powdered milk for their first solid milk chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Condensed Milk**: Chocolatiers soon discovered that using condensed milk—milk with much of its water boiled out, but still liquid—could create an even smoother, tastier product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Hershey's Unique Production Process

Milton Hershey, an already successful caramel maker, sought to develop his own milk chocolate process in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. His experiments, primarily conducted at his Pennsylvania homestead around 1903, focused on using skim milk, as milk fat would go rancid and compromise the shelf life of his envisioned mass-produced product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Hershey's breakthrough came with the help of factory worker John Schmalbach. Schmalbach mixed skim milk with sugar and cooked it in a giant copper vacuum pan at a very low temperature for an extended period, then allowed it to cool slowly in the vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This process produced a milk product that, when incorporated into chocolate, resulted in a smooth, shelf-stable bar with a distinctive "snap," well-suited for mass production through pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## The [[chemistry_of_butyric_acid_in_hershey_chocolate | Chemistry of Butyric Acid]] and Taste Perception

The low-temperature reduction process invented by John Schmalbach for Hershey had a significant side effect: it soured the milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Chocolate experts widely agree that the sour taste in Hershey's is due to [[chemistry_of_butyric_acid_in_hershey_chocolate | butyric acid]] (butter acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This acid is created by lipolyzing, or breaking down, the milk's fat content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. [[chemistry_of_butyric_acid_in_hershey_chocolate | Butyric acid]] can also be formed through anaerobic fermentation, which aligns with the vacuum pan process Hershey used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

> [!INFO] The Vomit Connection
> [[chemistry_of_butyric_acid_in_hershey_chocolate | Butyric acid]] is produced in human digestive systems and is responsible for the signature "twang" or smell and taste associated with vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This is why individuals who did not grow up consuming Hershey's chocolate often perceive its taste as "sick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

For those raised with Hershey's, like many Americans, the repeated exposure conditions them to associate [[chemistry_of_butyric_acid_in_hershey_chocolate | butyric acid]] with chocolate, not vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This [[cultural_and_psychological_influences_on_taste_preferences | cultural conditioning]] means that other chocolates, particularly British ones, can taste "flat" or "dull" to them, lacking the expected acidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## [[Differences between Hershey and Cadbury chocolates | Comparison with Cadbury and Other Chocolates]]

British chocolate, particularly Cadbury, is often perceived as fatty and creamy by those accustomed to Hershey's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Cadbury uses vegetable oils in addition to cocoa butter, which may contribute to its smoother, creamier texture compared to Hershey's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. American versions of Cadbury Dairy Milk, ironically distributed and partially manufactured by Hershey's, have adjusted recipes to comply with U.S. labeling laws (e.g., no vegetable oil if labeled as chocolate), yet still taste very different from a Hershey bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

Hershey detractors often describe its texture as waxy compared to Cadbury's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. However, some find this waxy texture, particularly when chocolate is chilled, appealing due to the "snap" of cold cocoa butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### BBC Focus Group Findings on [[Differences between Hershey and Cadbury chocolates | Hershey vs. Cadbury]]

A 2015 BBC focus group compared Hershey's and Cadbury, finding them fair comparisons as inexpensive, mass-produced chocolates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Adult participants generally preferred Cadbury, describing Hershey's as harder, more bitter, and less rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Interestingly, British children were more likely to prefer the Hershey bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Sugar and Cocoa Content

Contrary to popular belief, Hershey's bars do not necessarily contain significantly more sugar than Cadbury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. [[Differences between Hershey and Cadbury chocolates | Differences between Hershey and Cadbury chocolates]] in perceived sugar content are chiefly due to varying labeling regulations in the UK versus the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. While the proportion of sugar is similar, Cadbury lists milk higher on its ingredients list due to ranking liquid milk weight rather than evaporated weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Regarding cocoa content, the EU standard for minimum cocoa content in milk chocolate appears higher than the US standard, though comparisons are difficult as the EU measures dry cocoa solids and the US measures chocolate liquor (a wet product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. A Hershey spokesman stated their chocolate contains 30% cocoa solids, which would be higher than Cadbury's claimed 23% (though this likely refers to the UK version of the Hershey bar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Generally, Hershey's has less cocoa than fine European dark chocolate, as cocoa is expensive and intense, making it less ideal for mass-market chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## The Subjectivity of "Good" Food

The notion that less cocoa makes a chocolate "objectively inferior" is challenged by the fact that unsweetened baking chocolate, which is nearly 100% cocoa, is extremely bitter and unpleasant to eat on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This logic, if applied consistently, would suggest pure ethanol is superior to fine scotch or wine, which is absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

The argument that Hershey's is "objectively bad" because it tastes like vomit due to [[chemistry_of_butyric_acid_in_hershey_chocolate | butyric acid]] (a substance humans are evolved to find repulsive) also faces scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Many celebrated foods, particularly fermented ones like stinky cheeses (e.g., Parmesan, which also contains [[chemistry_of_butyric_acid_in_hershey_chocolate | butyric acid]]), exist on the edge of enticement and revulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

For desserts and candy, which serve no nutritional purpose and are purely for pleasure, [[cultural_and_psychological_influences_on_taste_preferences | objective judgments of "good" or "bad" are difficult to sustain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Personal preference, heavily influenced by [[cultural_and_psychological_influences_on_taste_preferences | childhood memories]] and nostalgia, plays a significant role in the enjoyment of such foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. For example, growing up near Hershey Park and consuming Hershey's Kisses throughout childhood can imbue the chocolate with warm, positive associations that enhance its taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Ultimately, anything that brings pleasure, without harming others or long-term well-being, holds value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

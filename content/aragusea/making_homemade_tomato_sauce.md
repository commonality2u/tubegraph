Making a delicious homemade tomato sauce is a foundational step for many classic Italian-American dishes, such as stuffed shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While you can make smaller batches, it's often beneficial to make extra and freeze it for future use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Ingredients

*   Onions (two large) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Garlic (at least half a head) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Olive oil (plenty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Crushed tomatoes (three or four 28-ounce cans, about 800 grams each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Tomato paste (one 6-ounce can, 170 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   Pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   Dried herbs (oregano, thyme, dried basil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   Salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>

### [[optional_ingredients_for_tomato_sauce | Optional Ingredients]]
*   Wine (a glass of red or white) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Sugar (a pinch, to offset bitterness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>

## Preparation Steps

1.  **Prepare Aromatics**
    *   Chop two large onions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
    *   Peel and chop at least half a head of garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
    *   Open at least one can of crushed tomatoes in advance, as you'll need them quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

2.  **Saut√© Onions**
    *   Place a large pot over medium-high heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
    *   Add a generous amount of olive oil to the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
    *   Add the chopped onions and stir frequently until they soften and begin to brown, which takes about 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

3.  **Add Garlic and Tomato Paste**
    *   Once onions are browning, add the chopped garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While garlic can be added from the start, it may burn if not stirred constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    *   Stir in one 6-ounce can of tomato paste and let it fry for a moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

4.  **Deglaze and Add Tomatoes**
    *   Just before the tomato paste might burn, add the first can of crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   Scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   Add two or three more large cans of crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

5.  **Season and Simmer**
    *   [[optional_ingredients_for_tomato_sauce | Optionally]], add a glass of red or white wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   Grind in a generous amount of pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   Add desired dried herbs, such as oregano, thyme, and dried basil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   Add a big pinch of salt to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   Pour in more olive oil, as a good amount of oil enhances the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Stir everything together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   Simmer the sauce over medium-low heat while you attend to other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Stir frequently to prevent the bottom from burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This method can lead to a relatively [[making_quick_tomato_sauce | quick tomato sauce]] compared to very slow-cooked versions.

6.  **Final Adjustments**
    *   Taste the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   If it tastes bitter, try stirring in more salt, as salt can offset bitter notes in canned tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
    *   There is no shame in adding a pinch of [[optional_ingredients_for_tomato_sauce | sugar]] as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   If the sauce is too thick (especially with canned tomatoes, which can be dense), loosen it with some water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
    *   If a smoother sauce is desired, you can blend it with a stick blender; otherwise, leave it chunky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The use of canned tomatoes here highlights the [[use_of_fresh_tomatoes_versus_precooked_sauce | difference in starting ingredients]].

In the early stages of human [[historical_evolution_of_human_diet_and_cooking | cooking]], complex [[cooking_techniques | cooking techniques]] like soup, stew, brazing, blanching, poaching, or frying did not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. When *Homo erectus* first began [[historical_evolution_of_human_diet_and_cooking | cooking]] food hundreds of thousands of years ago, it was primarily done by sticking food directly into a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. [[early_methods_of_cooking_and_roasting | Roasting]], a dry heating method, was the origin of [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Advent of Wet Cooking: Stone Boiling

The [[invention_and_evolution_of_cooking_vessels | epiphany]] of wet [[cooking_techniques | cooking]], often referred to as "Stone Soup" or "pot boiling," emerged tens of thousands of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This method involved dropping hot rocks into a water-safe container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This technique served as a primary way to simmer food for millennia until fire-safe and water-safe [[invention_and_evolution_of_cooking_vessels | cooking vessels]] were developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The exact origins of the first soup or stew are unknown, as the materials and methods used for such [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] degrade quickly, leaving little archaeological evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Much of the understanding on this topic is scholarly speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Early Concepts of Containing Liquids for Cooking

In 2015, anthropologist John Speth proposed that stew or soup might be much older than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. He empirically observed that a flammable material, such as an animal hide filled with wet ingredients, would not burn when held directly over a fire because the water prevents combustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While an animal hide might drip and extinguish the fire, ancient peoples could have used more waterproof, less drippy materials like an animal stomach or a clay-lined woven basket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Archaeological evidence supports the consumption of wet-cooked food by Neanderthals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. A grain of barley recovered from a Neanderthal's teeth in modern-day Iraq, dating back approximately 50,000 years, appeared to have been boiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This predates the first archaeological indications of more advanced wet [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### The Process of Stone Boiling

A simple method for [[significance_of_stone_boiling | stone boiling]] involves digging a hole, lining it with a large, waterproof leaf (like a banana leaf), adding water, and then dropping in hot stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Smooth river cobbles were historically preferred because they are less likely to chip into the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Food items like grains are then added to the water, and hot stones are carefully transferred from the fire to the basin to induce boiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

When stones are repeatedly heated and rapidly cooled in water, they develop a characteristic pattern of cracking and glazing known as "crazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Crazed river cobbles first appear in the archaeological record about 30,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. While their use as "pot boilers" isn't certain, they may have also served as hearth stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Nevertheless, pot boilers became a significant [[cooking_techniques | cooking method]] that persisted into the era of written history and is still practiced by some today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Benefits of Wet Cooking

[[significance_of_stone_boiling | Stone boiling]] offers several advantages:
*   **Safety**: Water is kept separate from the fire, preventing it from being put out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: Perfectly soft-cooked grains can be achieved in about an hour with just a hole and a leaf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Simplicity**: It avoids the labor-intensive process of grinding grains into flour and baking bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Purity**: Impurities like sand or pebbles in crudely processed grains sink to the bottom, allowing only the clean food to be consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Beyond practical benefits, wet [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] was a significant advancement for humanity:
*   **Nutrient Extraction**: More nutrients can be extracted from food as nothing drips onto the fire and is wasted; all nutrients are preserved in the broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This relates to [[history_of_food_preservation_methods | food preservation methods]] as the broth itself preserves nutrients.
*   **Food Softening**: Very tough foods can be softened into a digestible form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Increased Yield**: Soup can feed more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Nixtamalization and Stone Boiling

Scientists believe [[significance_of_stone_boiling | stone boiling]] may have led to the invention of nixtamalization by ancient Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Nixtamalization is the process of soaking corn in an alkaline solution to remove its waxy hull and make its amino acids more bioavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Without nixtamalization, a corn-based diet can lead to pellagra, a severe nutritional deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The idea for nixtamalization may have originated accidentally when corn was boiled with limestone pot boilers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. An experiment in 2011 showed that boiling corn with Cedar Mesa Limestone, as ancient people in Utah would have done, produced boil water strong enough to nixtamalize the corn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This demonstrates a plausible accidental discovery of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## The [[development_of_pottery_for_cooking | Development of Pottery for Cooking]]

Despite its benefits, [[significance_of_stone_boiling | stone boiling]] in materials like leaves or animal skins had disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The transition to [[development_of_pottery_for_cooking | cooking]] directly over a fire using pots was a significant advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### The Discovery of Clay

Clay, a common material in river basins, forms from the chemical weathering of exposed rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Slightly acidic rainwater containing carbonic acid dissolves minerals from rocks, which then flow into river and lake basins, forming clay deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Early potters likely discovered clay (or loam clay mixed with silt and sand) while digging for other purposes, noticing its smooth, plastic, and moldable qualities when wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Adding water makes it more moldable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Modern potters "wedge" clay by working it and bashing it with a rock to distribute water, remove air bubbles, and extract large impurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Molding clay into a vessel for holding things was significantly easier than carving bowls from rock or wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Firing and the First Kiln

After drying in the sun, a clay pot becomes hard, resembling a mud brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. However, even dry clay will dissolve in water, creating a muddy broth and causing the pot to melt away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. To prevent this, the clay must be "fired" at extremely high heat, which chemically transforms it into a ceramic that is hard and won't dissolve in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

It's likely that [[development_of_pottery_for_cooking | people]] discovered firing accidentally, perhaps by using fire to accelerate drying or by leaving a dried pot in a cooking fire after the water boiled out, causing it to reach firing temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The first kiln would have been a pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. A dried, preheated pot is placed into a fire pit, and glowing hot coals are continuously fed onto it until it is fully encased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. After cooling, the pot becomes a durable [[invention_and_evolution_of_cooking_vessels | cooking vessel]] that can be used directly on the fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Archaeological Evidence and Legacy

While scientists once believed [[development_of_pottery_for_cooking | pottery]] was first invented 5,000 to 10,000 years ago, fragments found in a cave in China in 2012 date back 20,000 years, making them the oldest known true ceramic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Although it's not definitively known if these were [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] pots, they showed signs of fire use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

Clay pots were the primary type of [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] vessel for a long time, extending well past the Stone Age into the Bronze and Iron Ages, and even into the early modern period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. While metal pots are superior due to better thermal conductivity and less risk of cracking, they were historically very expensive for ordinary families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Thus, the ceramic pot remained a simple, effective, and ubiquitous solution for a universal need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

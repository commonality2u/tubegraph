Short ribs, typically known as an excellent cut for braising, can also be prepared as a steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. They are heavily marbled with fat, which helps keep them moist during [[cooking techniques|long cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. While the connective tissue around the bone dissolves and creates a delicious sauce when braised, the meat itself is surprisingly tender, especially if you select the largest, meatiest English-cut short ribs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. These usually come from the chuck or rib section, which are inherently tender parts of the animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Preparing Short Ribs for Steaks

To transform a short rib into a wide, flat steak, you need to butterfly it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Butterflying Methods

When preparing to butterfly, observe the bone, which is typically slightly off-center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. It's often easiest to begin cutting on the side of the bone closest to the edge of the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

#### Method 1: The "Book" or "Hinge" Cut

1.  Cut down along the bone, getting as close to it as possible, but stop just before cutting all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
2.  Open the meat like a book; the thicker flap of meat on one side of the bone creates a better hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
3.  Next, cut the thicker side of the "book" in half its current thickness, again stopping right before going all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
4.  Open it up completely and make a few more shallow slices to help it lay as flat as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

#### Method 2: Accordion Cutting

1.  Cut down along the bone as described in the first method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
2.  Instead of opening it up, simply flip the meat around and make another straight cut down, not all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
3.  Then, unfurl the meat like the bellows of an accordion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This method might be slightly easier if you're making three or four cuts for super-thin Korean-style short ribs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Both methods are equally effective for creating a nice, thick short rib steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Cooking the Short Rib Steak

Once butterflied, season the steak with salt, pepper, and a little oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### Heat and Flipping

Since this is a thick steak, it requires less heat than thinner cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Cook on medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Flip the steak frequently, about every 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Using a Culinary Brick

After the first flip, consider using a culinary brick (a brick wrapped in aluminum foil for hygiene) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Wait until the first side has a slight sear before applying the brick to avoid cross-contamination with raw meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. While not strictly necessary, a butterflied cut might not lie completely flat, potentially "tenting up" around the hinges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The brick helps ensure even contact with the pan surface, promoting thorough crust formation across the entire piece of meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Continue flipping every 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Doneness

Cook the short rib steak to medium or even medium-well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This cut is tender enough to withstand higher doneness, and cooking it further allows the abundant fat to render and melt, providing moisture that offsets any dryness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Look for plenty of pink juice pushing up and pooling on the meat, which typically indicates medium doneness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Resting and Slicing

Once cooked, remove the steak and let it rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Then, slice it thinly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Although short rib is tender, thin slicing further aids edibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. While you can attempt to slice against the grain, the butterflying process often results in meat where the grain runs in multiple directions, so do your best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. A little finishing salt, perhaps smoked sea salt, can enhance the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

The fat in this cut can have a slightly gamey flavor reminiscent of lamb, especially when you enjoy the meat directly around the bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

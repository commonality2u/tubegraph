When [[cooking techniques | cooking]], adding a film of oil to a pan is a common first step for nearly every recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While many believe oil is primarily for preventing sticking, its most significant role is as a thermal interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## The Role of Oil as a Thermal Interface

A pan surface is flat and rigid, but food is not, meaning only tiny bits of the food make physical contact with the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Oil, or any liquid fat, serves as a "thermal interface" by filling the gaps between the food and the pan surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Because oil is an excellent conductor of heat, energy from the pan is transmitted into more parts of the food than the pan itself could reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This results in more even and thorough browning and cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Experiments with Vegetables
[[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | Cooking vegetables]] like Brussels sprouts without oil shows a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **With oil:** Brussels sprouts achieved a nice golden color and became very brown and tender in 6 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The browning was a broad smudge of golden brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Without oil:** Brussels sprouts did not stick if kept moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, the browning was localized, appearing as patches of black with clearly defined borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. After 6 minutes, they were still hard on the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Even after 11 minutes, they were not tender and risked burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The flavor was also not as good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Infrared imaging of broccoli revealed that with oil, the whole face of the food became hot, not just the points of direct contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Without oil, the heat was more localized to contact points, and the overall heat of the food was lower, leading to slower cooking and potential burning on the outside before the inside was tender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_thermal_interfaces_oil_vs_water | Oil versus Water as Cooking Mediums]]

Water can also act as a thermal interface, and food is boiled in water for the same reason fat is used for frying: it's a heat-conducting medium that can wrap around the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Water's Disadvantages:**
    *   **Temperature:** Most cooking oils can reach around 400°F (200°C) before breaking down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Water, under normal atmospheric pressure, only reaches 212°F (100°C) before evaporating into steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    *   **Browning:** Browning reactions like the Maillard reaction and caramelization require temperatures around 330°F (165°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Water simply cannot get that hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   **Viscosity:** Water is less viscous than fat, so it doesn't coat the food as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. To use water effectively as a thermal interface, food generally needs to be submerged (boiled) or enclosed in steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Boiling and Steaming:** Boiling food in water is a common [[history_of_food_boiling_techniques | cooking technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Steaming can be done by covering a pan with a lid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, cooking with only a thin film of water in a pan without a lid still takes a very long time; broccoli cooked this way for 15 minutes was still not tender, compared to 6 minutes with oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Cooking Meat with and without Oil

[[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | Cooking meat]] presents unique challenges due to its composition.
*   **Sticking:** Meat, being mostly water and protein, is particularly prone to sticking to a pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Proteins form complexes with metal atoms at high temperatures, literally bonding to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Sirloin Steak (Unoiled):** A lean cut like sirloin steak without added oil sticks like glue to the pan, requiring scraping to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. While the meat is flat and pliable, making better contact than vegetables, it still shows extreme contrast between blackened bits that touched the metal and gray bits that received little heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Sirloin Steak (Oiled):** With oil, the steak cooked much faster and tasted significantly better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The oil forms a barrier between proteins and metal, and its effectiveness as a thermal interface cooks the surface faster and more thoroughly, allowing a brown crust to release easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Non-Stick Pans:** Even in a non-stick pan, oil is needed as a thermal interface and for flavor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Without it, even if sticking is prevented, the meat cooks slowly, and the crust is poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Steam bubbles can push the meat away from the hot surface, leading to "repulsive patches of gray" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Fattier Meats:** While some very fatty meats like Wagyu beef may not need extra fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, a skin-on chicken thigh cooked in a dry, cold pan (a [[cooking_techniques | technique]] for duck breast) showed mixed results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Though some fat rendered, the skin still had an undesirable mixture of overdone and underdone due to insufficient thermal interface at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## Baking in the Oven

The difference made by oil is less pronounced when baking in an oven compared to pan-frying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Vegetables:** Oiled and unoiled vegetables (e.g., parsnips) showed similar color on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. However, the side touching the metal had better, more even browning with oil, while the unoiled side was a mix of burned and pale, and somewhat dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Meat:** Oiled and unoiled beef roast appeared almost identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This is likely because the open structure of the beef allowed rendered fat to settle on the surface, providing its own thermal interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Oiled chicken skin, however, looked slightly nicer than unoiled, possibly because the skin itself acted as a barrier preventing rendered fat from pushing up and coating the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Beyond Thermal Interface

In addition to being an excellent thermal interface and anti-stick agent, fat also contributes to flavor development through chemical interactions at high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. It is also an essential nutrient and facilitates the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

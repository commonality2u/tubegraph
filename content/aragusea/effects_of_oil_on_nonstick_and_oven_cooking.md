While [[role_of_oil_in_cooking | oil]] is commonly used to prevent food from sticking to pans, its primary role is as a [[thermal_interfaces_in_cooking | thermal interface]] to facilitate efficient heat transfer and promote browning and flavor development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:10">[01:48:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:30">[01:54:30]</a>. The impact of oil varies depending on the cooking method, specifically when using nonstick pans or ovens.

## Cooking in Nonstick Pans

Even when sticking is not an issue, such as with a nonstick pan, oil still plays a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:16">[07:00:16]</a>.

Consider cooking a sirloin steak in a nonstick pan without oil:
*   **Slow Cooking** The meat cooks very slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:54">[07:07:54]</a>.
*   **Poor Crust** The resulting crust is notably worse compared to cooking with oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:41">[07:09:41]</a>.
*   **Steam Barrier** On a Teflon surface, there's nothing to stop large "balloons of steam" from pushing the meat away from the hot pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:07">[07:19:07]</a>. This results in unattractive gray patches on the cooked meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:07">[07:26:07]</a>.

Even in a nonstick pan, oil is necessary to act as a [[thermal_interfaces_in_cooking | thermal interface]] and to contribute to flavor development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:43">[07:29:43]</a>.

## Cooking in the Oven

The necessity of oil when cooking food in an oven was tested with various items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:15">[09:17:15]</a>. Mixed vegetables, a fatty beef roast, and chicken thighs were cooked at 400°F (204°C) with oil applied to one half of the pan and no oil on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:20">[09:20:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:29">[09:36:29]</a>.

### Observations:
*   **Vegetables**
    *   **Surface Appearance** After 30 minutes, the visual difference in browning on top between the oiled and unoiled vegetables was surprisingly minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:09">[09:41:09]</a>.
    *   **Underside Contact** However, a significant difference was observed on the side of the vegetables touching the pan:
        > [09:51:00] This parsnip was coated in oil and the side that touched the metal got beautiful golden brown I want to eat that over on the no oil side the part of the parsnip touching the metal has some of that same uneven coloration you get without the interface of the oil a mixture of burned and pale it's also kind of dry not as appetizing IMHO
*   **Meat**
    *   **Beef Roast** The oiled beef roast looked exactly the same as the unoiled beef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. This is likely because the open structure of the beef allowed plenty of its own rendered fat to settle on the surface, creating its own [[thermal_interfaces_in_cooking | thermal interface]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:17">[10:30:17]</a>.
    *   **Chicken Thighs** The oiled chicken skin appeared slightly nicer than the unoiled skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:50">[10:17:50]</a>. This is attributed to the chicken skin acting as a barrier, preventing rendered fat from pushing up and settling on the surface as it did with the beef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:28">[10:24:28]</a>.

<span class="callout-title">Conclusion</span>
Overall, oil does not make as large a difference in oven cooking as one might expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:05">[10:35:05]</a>.

## Summary of Oil's Benefits in Cooking

Beyond preventing sticking, oil's primary benefits in cooking include:
*   **Thermal Interface** It serves as an excellent [[thermal_interfaces_in_cooking | thermal interface]], efficiently transferring heat to the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.
*   **Flavor Enhancement** Oil contributes to the creation of delicious flavors at high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:50">[06:51:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:14">[06:53:14]</a>.
*   **Nutritional Role** It is an essential nutrient and facilitates the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.

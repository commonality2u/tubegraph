Smoking is a versatile [[cooking_techniques | cooking technique]] that preserves food physically and chemically, while also imparting desirable flavors [00:00:00]. Evidence suggests Neolithic people smoked hunted animals, possibly using simple tripod setups [00:00:08].

## Purpose of Smoking Food

Smoking serves two primary purposes:
1.  **Preservation** Smoke preserves food by drying it and through the [[chemical_properties_of_wood_smoke_in_food_preservation | chemical properties of wood smoke]] [00:00:00]. Drying is considered the oldest food preservation method [00:03:42]. Fire provides warm, dry, moving air, which is excellent for drying [00:04:02].
2.  **Flavor** Smoke imparts unique flavors to food [00:00:04]. Ancient people likely discovered smoking when they noticed food dried by the fire tasted better and lasted longer than sun-dried food [00:04:14].

## Food Preparation for Smoking

To enhance both safety and effectiveness, smoking often starts with specific preparation:
*   **Salt Curing** Safe smoking typically begins with a salt cure, even a short one [00:00:24]. Salt curing is considered more effective for preservation than smoking alone [00:00:20].
    *   Salt chemically kills microbes and extracts water from the meat [00:08:53]. This process, called osmosis, makes the meat stiffer and drier, inhibiting microbial growth [00:01:16].
    *   While historically useful for high-pathogen meat, salt curing can also be applied to fruits like peaches to accelerate drying, despite fruit acidity making them less hospitable to microorganisms [00:01:06].
*   **Thin Slicing** Both salting and smoking are more effective with thin food due to increased surface area [00:00:30]. For instance, meat can be cut against the grain in an "accordion cut" to create long, thin pieces that are easier to drape over a fire [00:00:38].

## Fire Building for Smoke

Generating the right kind of smoke is crucial for successful smoking:
*   **Wood Selection**
    *   **Deadfall:** Pre-dried deadfall branches are ideal for firewood [00:02:30].
    *   **Fresh Wood:** Living or recently chopped wood contains a lot of water, which makes it difficult to burn and produces less smoke proportionally [00:01:59]. It requires significant heat to overcome the water content [00:02:11] and typically needs to dry for at least a year before use [00:02:26].
    *   **Bark:** Burning bark, which contains a lot of protein, is particularly good for producing nitric oxide, a chemical in smoke that helps stabilize the meat's color [00:14:03].
*   **Fire Starting** A "square of twigs" or "cage of twigs" can be used as a base, allowing ample oxygen to feed the fire [00:03:31]. Start with small tinder (leaves), then progressively larger materials (small twigs, bigger twigs, small logs) [00:02:58].
*   **Generating Smoke** For smoking, a "barely smoldering fire" is desired, producing smoke rather than intense heat [00:02:23]. Smoke is a product of incomplete combustion [00:03:32]. A hot, roaring fire burns more of the organic chemicals that comprise smoke, producing less smoke proportionally [00:03:41]. A low smoldering fire burns less of its own smoke, which is beneficial for transferring chemicals to the food [00:03:50].

## Smoking Techniques

There are two primary [[differences_between_hot_and_cold_smoking | types of smoking]]:
1.  **Cold Smoking**
    *   **Temperature:** Generally defined as anything below 85째F (30째C) [00:07:48]. Temperatures warmer than this can cause fat to melt out [00:07:52].
    *   **Purpose:** Primarily for preservation [00:07:14]. It results in dried products like beef jerky [00:07:16].
    *   **Process:** The food is kept at basically room temperature [00:07:02].
    *   **Challenges:** Unless smoking on a cold day or in a refrigerated chamber, cold smoking holds meat in the "bacterial danger zone" (temperatures that promote microbial growth but don't kill pathogens) [00:08:35]. This is why prior salt curing is crucial for safety [00:08:48].
2.  **Hot Smoking**
    *   **Temperature:** Above 160째F (70째C) [00:07:22].
    *   **Purpose:** Primarily for flavor and cooking, not preservation [00:07:45].
    *   **Process:** In a moist environment, connective tissue (collagen) breaks down, and meat braises in its own internal water, becoming fall-apart tender [00:07:24].
    *   **Result:** Produces products like American-style barbecue, which is too wet to be preserved [00:07:38].

## Chemical Effects of Smoke

Smoke impacts food beyond just flavor:
*   **Antimicrobial Properties:**
    *   Smoke impedes insects' respiration [00:03:37].
    *   Specific chemicals in wood smoke have antimicrobial effects [00:06:56].
    *   **Liquid Smoke:** A water-based liquid created by condensing actual smoke, which can kill or inhibit bacteria [00:09:27]. This works because "bad smoke chemicals" (like PAHs) aren't very soluble and can be left behind [00:09:42].
    *   **Phenols:** Disrupt bacterial cell membranes, causing them to leak and die [00:10:25].
    *   **Carbonyls:** Bond with amino acids in proteins, deactivating essential enzymes needed by germs [00:10:30]. They also bind with amino acids in the environment that bacteria need for food [00:10:45].
*   **Coloration:** Smoke contributes to the bright pink color seen in cooked smoked meats (e.g., cured ham) [00:13:14].
    *   **Carbon Monoxide and Nitric Oxide:** These chemicals, especially nitric oxide, form strong bonds with the myoglobin protein in meat [00:13:39]. Myoglobin's iron content determines meat color [00:13:50].
    *   Nitric oxide stabilizes myoglobin, making the protein less likely to change and turn brown when cooked or exposed to air [00:14:09].

## Challenges and [[risks_and_safety_concerns_of_smoked_foods | Risks and Safety Concerns of Smoked Foods]]

Despite its benefits, smoking food presents several challenges and [[risks_and_safety_concerns_of_smoked_foods | safety concerns]]:
*   **Inconsistent Antimicrobial Effects:** The effectiveness of smoke as a preservative varies greatly based on how the food is smoked, duration, wood type, and the specific bacteria targeted [00:10:51].
*   **Listeria Risk:** Some bacteria, like *Listeria*, are highly resistant to smoke, salt, and acid [00:11:15]. *Listeria* can multiply at refrigerator temperatures and has been implicated in outbreaks from cold-smoked meat [00:11:31]. Cooking is the only sure way to kill *Listeria* [00:11:39]. Pregnant or immunocompromised individuals are particularly vulnerable to *Listeria* infections [00:11:54].
*   **Case Hardening:** If the outer layer of meat dries too quickly during smoking, it can form a hard crust, trapping moisture inside [00:07:56]. This internal moisture allows for microbial growth, even if the outside appears preserved [00:08:11].
*   **Carcinogenic Compounds (PAHs):**
    *   **Direct Smoking:** Smoking food directly over a fire, as in primitive setups, results in significantly more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the food [00:15:29]. PAHs are components of smoke that may cause cancer [00:09:47].
    *   **Melting Fat:** If the fire gets too hot, fat can melt out of the meat, drip into the fire, and burn, creating PAHs [00:15:13].
    *   **Modern Commercial Smoking:** To mitigate PAHs, modern commercial smoking is usually indirect [00:15:38]. Smoke is funneled through a pipe where it cools, causing some PAHs to condense and drop out before reaching the food [00:15:43].
*   **Wood Choice:** Burning softwoods can release resins that may make one sick [00:14:52]. Burning wood with fungus could also pose unknown health risks [00:14:57].

Historically, ancient people likely didn't recognize these long-term health hazards, as their lifespans were shorter and more pressing survival issues often took precedence over diseases like cancer [00:15:53].

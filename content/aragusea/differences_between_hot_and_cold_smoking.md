Smoking is a food preservation technique that has been practiced since Neolithic times, with evidence suggesting early humans smoked hunted animals using simple setups like tripods of sticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Smoke preserves food both physically and chemically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. There are two primary types of smoking: hot smoking and cold smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Cold Smoking

[[techniques and challenges of smoking food | Cold smoking]] is primarily used for food preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Temperature**: Defined as smoking done below 85°F (30°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Maintaining a "barely smoldering fire" is key to produce smoke without excessive heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. If the temperature is too warm, fat in the food can melt out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Aims to dry the food, resulting in products like beef jerky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    *   Requires food to be cut thin for effective drying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
    *   Often starts with a [[risks and safety concerns of smoked foods | salt cure]], which accelerates drying and chemically kills microbes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
    *   The food is not cooked during [[techniques and challenges of smoking food | cold smoking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Characteristics**: Results in chewy, salty meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Can preserve meat for months if kept dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Color**: The meat retains a bright pink color, even after cooking, due to carbon monoxide and nitric oxide in the smoke stabilizing the myoglobin protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Nitric oxide forms a strong bond with myoglobin, preventing it from browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **Safety Concerns**:
    *   Holding food below 85°F (30°C) means it remains in the bacterial danger zone, where microbes can grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
    *   [[risks and safety concerns of smoked foods | Listeria]] is particularly resistant to smoke, salt, and acid, and can multiply at refrigerator temperatures, making [[techniques and challenges of smoking food | cold smoked]] meat a potential vector for outbreaks, especially for pregnant or immunocompromised individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
    *   [[risks and safety concerns of smoked foods | Case hardening]] can occur if the outer layer dries too quickly, trapping moisture inside and promoting microbial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
    *   Direct smoking can lead to high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are carcinogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Modern commercial smoking uses indirect methods to reduce PAHs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Hot Smoking

[[techniques and challenges of smoking food | Hot smoking]] is primarily used for flavor and cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Temperature**: Occurs in a moist environment above 160°F (70°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Aims to cook the food while infusing it with smoke flavor. It is not primarily for preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Process**:
    *   The high heat breaks down connective tissue (collagen), causing the meat to braise in its own internal water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
    *   Keeping the smoker somewhat sealed maintains high humidity, preventing the meat from drying out prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Characteristics**: Results in "fall apart tender" meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. An example is American-style barbecue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Safety Concerns**: Generally safer in terms of microbial growth due to cooking temperatures, but still carries risks related to PAHs if not done properly or if fat drips into the fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

## Key Differences

| Feature     | Cold Smoking                                       | Hot Smoking                                     |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Preservation, drying (e.g., beef jerky)            | Cooking and flavor (e.g., American barbecue)    |
| **Temp.**   | Below 85°F (30°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>      | Above 160°F (70°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>     |
| **Result**  | Drier, chewier, saltier; preserved but uncooked   | Tender, cooked; not preserved (too wet)         |
| **Safety**  | High risk of microbial growth due to danger zone temp; often requires pre-salting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a> | Kills microbes through cooking; concern for PAHs if fat drips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a> |

## Smoke's Preservation and Flavor Properties

Smoke preserves food both physically (drying) and chemically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. [[chemical properties of wood smoke in food preservation | The chemicals in smoke]] (phenols and carbonyls) inhibit bacterial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Phenols disrupt bacterial cell membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, while carbonyls deactivate enzymes and consume amino acids needed by bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Additionally, bugs dislike smoke, as it impedes their respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

For both hot and cold smoking, generating a good volume of smoke requires incomplete combustion of wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. A hot, roaring fire produces less smoke because more organic chemicals are burned off, whereas a low, smoldering fire burns less of its own smoke, leading to more flavorful and preserving chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Safety and Health Considerations

When smoking, it's crucial to use appropriate wood, as resins in softwoods can potentially make you sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. The presence of fungus on wood also introduces unknown risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Direct smoking over a fire can lead to higher levels of [[risks and safety concerns of smoked foods | carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]] compared to modern indirect smoking methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Indirect smoking funnels cooled smoke into a separate chamber, allowing some PAHs to condense and be left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

Historically, ancient people likely didn't realize the long-term health hazards, but smoking provided a crucial means of [[risks and safety concerns of smoked foods | food preservation]] to prevent starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

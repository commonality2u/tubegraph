Nougat is an aerated confection where air is stabilized by a protein, and the continuous phase (main structure) is primarily a sugar syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. In nougat, air is the dispersed phase, held within a sugar matrix and a web of proteins surrounding the air bubbles, which makes the whipped sugar syrup stable, solid, and stretchy or bouncy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

## Key Variables in Nougat Production

According to Dr. Richard Hartel, a professor of food engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, what distinguishes nougat from other similar confections like [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | meringue]] or [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | marshmallow]] comes down to four major variables: air content, water content, the type of sugar used, and the type of protein used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. These [[factors_affecting_the_texture_of_nougat | factors affecting the texture of nougat]] are controlled during the manufacturing process.

## Manufacturing Steps (Crown Candy Example)

The manufacturing process for nougat involves several key steps, as demonstrated by Crown Candy, a confectionary operating for over 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

1.  **Preparation of Components:**
    *   Liquids (like sugar syrup) are placed in an upper kettle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
    *   Solids are prepared in a bottom kettle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
    *   The lower bowl mixture is similar to a [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | meringue]]: whipped egg whites with sugar to stabilize bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
    *   In a factory setting, this typically involves combining water with dried egg albumen, a mix of different sugars (like fructose and corn syrup), and a pre-whipped sugar and egg mixture called "frappe" to initiate aeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

2.  **Cooking and Mixing:**
    *   The liquid mixture is cooked to a specific temperature to remove a desired amount of moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
    *   This hot syrup is then gradually dropped into the solids and whipped in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. This process slowly cooks the nougat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

3.  **Cooling and Forming:**
    *   The whipped nougat is brought to a table to cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
    *   It is then placed into an extruder, which forms it into logs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
    *   A guillotine mechanism cuts the nougat logs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
    *   The nougat is often coated with caramel and nuts at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

4.  **Curing/Drying:**
    *   The nougat logs are then placed in a climate-controlled room to cure or dry out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This process further refines the [[factors_affecting_the_texture_of_nougat | water content]] and overall texture.

## Control of Variables during Manufacturing

### Protein Type
Nougat is typically made with egg protein (albumin) and sometimes soy protein (globulin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This contrasts with [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | marshmallow]], which often includes gelatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Gelatin forms complex helices at junction zones that act like springs, providing a squishy, elastic, and bouncy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. In contrast, albumin and globulin form simpler networks that do not exhibit the same bounciness, resulting in a nougat that tends to stay compressed when pressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### Water Content
The water content significantly influences the texture of the finished nougat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. The more water a confection has, the softer it will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Candy makers control water content by boiling the sugar syrup to a specific temperature; the higher the temperature, the less water remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

For instance, Italian [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | meringue]] (which uses egg foam like nougat but no gelatin) is cooked to about 240°F (115°C), leaving a lot of water and resulting in a soft, spreadable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. In contrast, nougat at Crown Candy is boiled to 270°F (132°C), producing a much firmer product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

Environmental humidity can also impact water content, as sugar is hygroscopic (absorbs water from the air) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Manufacturers like Jamie Weatherford at Crown Candy adjust boiling temperatures based on weather conditions to achieve the desired texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. For example, in humid conditions, the syrup might be cooked to a higher temperature (e.g., 272°F) to account for moisture absorption from the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

### Sugar Type and Crystallization
The type and state of sugar used greatly influence nougat's texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
*   **Crystalline vs. Amorphous:** If the sugar is partially crystalline, like in a Three Musketeers bar, the nougat will break cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. If the sugar remains amorphous (non-crystalline), like in a Charleston Chew, the nougat will be chewy and stretch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
*   **Sugar Ratios:** This is achieved by changing the ratio of sugars, typically cane sugar (sucrose) and corn syrup (glucose and other sugars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Honey can also be used as a more expensive alternative to corn syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   **"Doctoring" Agents:** Corn syrup acts as a "doctoring" agent, inhibiting the formation of sugar crystals by getting between sucrose molecules and preventing them from linking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. The more crystallized the nougat, the more brittle or "short" its texture; fewer crystals result in a chewier texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. Ingredient labels reflect these ratios, with more sugar listed first in a brittle nougat (e.g., Three Musketeers) and more corn syrup listed first in a chewy one (e.g., Charleston Chew) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   **Inversion and Seed Crystals:** Crystallization can also be stopped by inverting sugar (breaking sucrose into monosaccharides) using heat or acid (e.g., cream of tartar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. The size of crystals also matters; a Three Musketeers bar has many small crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. This can be achieved by adding powdered sugar as "seed crystals" during the mixing process, which then grow over time to produce a short texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

### Air Content
The amount of air whipped into the nougat significantly changes its texture and density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | Marshmallow]] has a very low density (around 0.3-0.4), while nougat is much denser (closer to 0.9-1.0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

Air is also a crucial economic factor in the food industry, as "the more air you can [incorporate], the more money you make" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. Nougat provides free bulk for a product, making larger candy bars like Three Musketeers appealing to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.

The process of making nougat, by subtly varying the proteins, sugars, water, and air, allows for a vast array of textures and forms within the "nougat" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

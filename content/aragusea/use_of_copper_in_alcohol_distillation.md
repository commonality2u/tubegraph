Copper is widely used in the production of spirits, with distillation vessels traditionally and presently often constructed from this metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Both traditional [[pot_still_versus_column_still_distillation | pot stills]] and more modern [[pot_still_versus_column_still_distillation | column stills]] are commonly made of copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Chemical Properties: Sulfur Removal

A primary reason for copper's use in [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distillation]] is its chemical reactivity and affinity for sulfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. As the distillate passes through the copper still in vapor form, copper actively pulls sulfur out of the vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

This process is particularly beneficial for brandies, which are extracted from wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Wine contains a significant amount of sulfur compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. While these may not be noticeable in wine, they become highly apparent in brandy, producing an undesirable "rotten egg" taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The low pH of a spirit means even small amounts of sulfur can be tasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Copper addresses this by bonding with the sulfur compounds in the distillate, effectively removing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Historical and Practical Reasons for Copper Stills

While modern distillers understand copper's role in sulfur removal, the earliest people building copper stills did not have this chemical knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Their reasons were more practical:
*   **Heat Conductivity** Copper is an excellent heat conductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, second only to diamond and silver in thermal conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This property ensures efficient and even heating of the mash during [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distillation]].
*   **Workability** Copper is remarkably easy to work with among metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   **Early Metal Use** Copper was likely the first metal used by humans, often found in its pure elemental form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   **Malleability** Unlike iron, which requires smelting, copper can be worked cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. It is highly malleable, meaning it can be easily formed into shapes using tools like a hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   **Ductility** Copper is also very ductile, allowing it to be drawn into thin wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

These characteristics made copper an ideal material for crafting the intricate shapes required for [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distillation]] equipment long before its specific chemical benefits were understood.

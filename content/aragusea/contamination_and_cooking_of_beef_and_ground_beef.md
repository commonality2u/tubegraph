Many people prefer their steak cooked medium-rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When cooking steak, it's often better to aim for slightly too rare than overcooked, as overcooked steak is less desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The safety of consuming rare steak versus other meats like chicken or hamburger is a common question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Safety of Rare Steak
According to Dr. Francisco Diaz-Gonzalez, director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, when a piece of red meat muscle is intact, contamination primarily resides on its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Common pathogens like E. coli and Salmonella do not typically live within the muscle itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Instead, these bacteria are found in the animal's digestive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. During the slaughtering process, these bacteria can transfer to the surface of the carcass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Therefore, if the surface of the steak is thoroughly cooked, it is most likely safe to consume, even if the inside remains rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Ground Beef Contamination
The safety equation for ground beef is entirely different from that of a whole cut of steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. In ground beef, any external contamination from the slaughterhouse that was on the surface of the meat gets mixed throughout the entire product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Because Salmonella and E. coli can be heat-resistant, expert advice recommends cooking ground beef to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius) to ensure safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Comparisons with Other Meats
### Chicken
Chicken must be cooked all the way through, regardless of whether it's ground or a whole piece, to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Scientific literature indicates that pathogens like Campylobacter and Salmonella can be internalized within chicken muscle pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Therefore, consuming undercooked chicken carries a risk of illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Fish (Sushi)
The cooking recommendations for fish vary by species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. While raw fish, such as sushi, is widely consumed, Dr. Diaz-Gonzalez is wary of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. However, there are not many reported cases of sushi-related illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. One reason for this might be that much of the fish used for sushi today has been flash-frozen, which can kill some pathogens like *Vibrio* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Freezing is a helpful safety measure for fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Pork
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) previously recommended cooking whole cuts of pork to 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. However, in 2011, this guidance was relaxed, and 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius) is now considered safe for whole cuts, provided the meat rests for a couple of minutes afterward to allow the internal temperature to rise slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Pork cooked to this temperature will appear slightly pink but is very tasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

The older, more conservative guidance for pork was partly due to concerns about [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | trichinosis]], a parasitic disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. However, improved practices in the pork industry have significantly reduced cases of [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | trichinosis]] in the United States, with most current cases linked to wild game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Despite this, bacteria like Salmonella can still be an issue with pork, primarily on the outside of the muscle, similar to beef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Therefore, pink pork chops are safe, but pink sausage is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

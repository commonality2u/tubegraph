From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

When [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | cooking meat]], moisture is typically pushed out, similar to wringing a wet sponge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, as meat cools, it can absorb moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Salting Steak

While some might apply salt and pepper directly to a steak before [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | cooking]], the notion that salting meat immediately before [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | cooking]] enhances browning is considered a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. If you intend to salt meat in advance, it is recommended to do so at least 40 minutes beforehand, a point supported by Kenji's authoritative article on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Dressing the Board Technique

An alternative approach to [[seasoning_and_dry_curing_chicken | seasoning]] meat, particularly steak, is to flavor the [[seasoning_cutting_board_instead_of_steak | cutting board]] rather than the meat directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This technique, known as "dressing the board," allows for prep work to be done concurrently while the steak is [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Ingredients for the Board

Common ingredients used to dress the board include:
*   **Rosemary:** Freshly chopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Garlic:** Finely grated; use sparingly as it will be virtually raw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Citrus:** A small amount of lemon, lime, or even grapefruit can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Pepper:** Coarsely ground pepper is preferred raw, as [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | cooking]] it can cause burning on the steak and diminish its pungency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This is why fine dining restaurants often offer to grind pepper at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Butter:** A few slivers of fresh butter are placed on the board. The milky taste of fresh butter provides a contrast to the deep flavor of steak, a practice common in classic American steak houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Salting the Board

Only a small amount of salt is added to the [[seasoning_cutting_board_instead_of_steak | cutting board]] at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The majority of the salt is intended to be a super coarse finishing salt, applied later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This allows for concentrated, crunchy crystals of salt, offering "little sparks of salt" rather than a uniform, low-level saltiness throughout the meat, similar to how pretzels are finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Post-Cooking Process

### Resting the Steak

After [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | cooking]] (e.g., a strip steak for nine minutes total), the steak is rested for about five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. During this time, it is placed directly on the dressed board. The heat from the steak softens the rosemary, melts the butter, and mellows the raw garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. As the meat rests, it releases juices, which are then used to augment the flavors on the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Slicing and Re-absorption

The steak is then sliced into thin, bite-sized pieces and tossed in the accumulated pool of flavor-augmented beef juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This process allows the meat to reabsorb moisture and flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Re-resting the meat a second time can lead to even more absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Plate Warming

To prevent the meat from going cold after slicing and resting, it's advised to eat it directly from the board or warm the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. A simple way to warm a plate is to run it under hot water for a minute on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. A hot plate can even reheat a well-rested piece of meat, which is why steak houses commonly heat their plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. After this process, minimal juice should be left on the board, indicating that the meat has effectively absorbed the flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Any tender cut of meat can be used with this method, and even without additional flavorings, tossing the meat in its own juices can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

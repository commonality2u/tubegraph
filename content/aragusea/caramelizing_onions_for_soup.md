To begin making a [[making_a_great_vegetable_soup | great vegetable soup]], the first step is to chop some form of onion, such as a shallot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This chopped onion should then be slowly caramelized for half an hour with a star anise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Purpose and Benefits
Caramelizing onions with star anise creates umami sulfur compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Onions, when cooked in plain water, make a delicious broth with only water, heat, and time as additional ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This method simplifies [[vegetable_preparation_for_soup | vegetable preparation]] for soup, as the "secret" is simply to chop the onion, put it in a pot with water, and boil it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Not every meal needs to include an animal product. When vegetables are cooked in plain water, their natural flavors become remarkably pronounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

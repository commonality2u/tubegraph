Dutch babies, a type of popover baked in a wide pan, can be made using various types of cookware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07"></a>. The choice of pan can influence the amount of butter needed and the ease of removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16"></a>.

## Traditional Cast Iron
Traditionally, Dutch babies are cooked in [[History of cast iron cookware | cast iron]] pans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16"></a>. When using a cast iron pan, ensure a good layer of butter is melted in it before adding the batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26"></a>. If the pan isn't non-stick, you may need to melt extra butter onto the bottom to help release the cooked Dutch baby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38"></a>.

## Non-Stick Pans
Non-stick pans offer an advantage by requiring less butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18"></a>. A well-designed non-stick pan allows the cooked Dutch baby to be easily lifted out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59"></a>.

### Misen Non-Stick Pan
The Misen non-stick pan is highlighted for its quality and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06"></a>:
*   **Coating** It features a three-layer Dupont Platinum coating, which is noted as their most scratch-resistant coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13"></a>.
*   **Performance** It is described as two and a half times more non-stick than pans costing twice as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20"></a>.
*   **Durability** A plasma primer layer underneath the coating helps keep it in place, contributing to a long lifespan, even with oven use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23"></a>.
*   **Design** The handle is oven-safe and designed to feel comfortable and solid in hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29"></a>.

## Pan Size
A 10-inch (25 cm) diameter pan is suitable for a two or three-egg Dutch baby, though a three or even four-egg popover could fit, a thinner product is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28"></a>.

## Preheating the Pan
For optimal results, the pan should be heated in the oven to 425°F (220°C) along with the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03"></a>. Heating the pan in the oven is considered more efficient than on the stove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08"></a>. The pan is ready when butter melts enthusiastically upon contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12"></a>. It's crucial to get the batter into the hot pan quickly before the butter burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20"></a>.

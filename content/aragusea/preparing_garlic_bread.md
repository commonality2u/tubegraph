To accompany classic Italian-American dishes like stuffed shells, [[making_mashed_potatoes_with_garlic | garlic]] bread can be prepared as a "full-on Jersey Shore" accompaniment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The key to its preparation is using a substantial amount of butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Ingredients

*   **Butter**
    *   Two sticks (half a pound / 225 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
    *   Soften the butter in a microwave on low power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Garlic**
    *   Half a head of [[making_mashed_potatoes_with_garlic | garlic]], chopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Seasoning**
    *   A "whole bunch" of pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
    *   Enough salt to make it "a little too salty," as it will season the bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. If using salted butter, less additional salt is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Bread**
    *   A big baguette, cut in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Herbs**
    *   Fresh herbs (optional for mixing, but preferred for sprinkling on top at the end) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Preparation Steps

1.  **Make the Garlic Butter**
    *   Combine the softened butter, chopped [[making_mashed_potatoes_with_garlic | garlic]], pepper, and salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   While herbs can be mixed in, it's suggested to sprinkle them on top at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
2.  **Prepare the Bread**
    *   Cut a large baguette in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   Generously slather the [[making_mashed_potatoes_with_garlic | garlic]] butter mixture onto the bread, ensuring enough is applied to melt down through the bread during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   Place the buttered bread on a tray, as butter will leak during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
3.  **Cook**
    *   Place the [[making_mashed_potatoes_with_garlic | garlic]] bread under the broiler (also known as the grill) for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
    *   Cook until brown and crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
4.  **Serve**
    *   Sprinkle additional herbs on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    *   Chop the bread into chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

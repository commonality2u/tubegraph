When preparing *rösti*, the decision to rinse raw grated potatoes significantly impacts the final texture and cooking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02">[05:02]</a>.

## Reasons for Rinsing
Rinsing potatoes, especially raw ones, removes excess free starch from the surface of the shreds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25">[05:25]</a>. This free starch, if not removed, can contribute to a slimy texture in the cooked interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07">[05:07]</a> and can also cause the potato to brown very easily on the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20">[03:20]</a>. Many traditional recipes advise washing off this free starch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35">[05:35]</a>.

## Technique for Rinsing
After grating raw potatoes, place them in a bowl of cool tap water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18">[05:18]</a>. Using hot water could gelatinize the starch and make the potatoes gummy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21">[05:21]</a>. It's often beneficial to drain and rinse the potatoes a second time in fresh water for a cleaner result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29">[05:29]</a>. After rinsing, the potatoes should be thoroughly squeezed dry before salting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40">[05:40]</a>.

## Effects of Rinsing
Rinsing potatoes results in shreds that feel "clean and separate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47">[05:47]</a>. While this prevents a slimy interior, it can also lead to challenges:
*   **Binding:** The free starch acts as a "starch glue" or binder, helping the *rösti* cake hold together as it cooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49">[05:49]</a>. Without this, the cake may not bind sufficiently, making it difficult to flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56">[05:56]</a>.
*   **Crispiness:** The starchy residue contributes to a nice, crispy surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20">[06:20]</a>. Rinsed potatoes may be less crispy on the exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18">[06:18]</a>.
*   **Cooking Time/Heat:** If washing off the starch, one must be more conservative with heat during cooking to prevent burning the surface before the interior has cooked and bound together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06">[06:06]</a>.

## Comparison with Non-Rinsed Potatoes
In experiments, *rösti* made from [[using_parboiled_vs_raw_potatoes_for_rsti | raw, non-rinsed potatoes]] produced a very crispy exterior, but the interior could be "slimy" due to the wet, starchy residue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02">[05:02]</a>.

## Combining Rinsing with Baking for Optimal Results
To achieve the best of both worlds—a non-slimy interior and a crispy exterior—a combined approach can be used:
1.  **Partial Rinse:** Rinse grated potatoes, but not as thoroughly as to remove all starch. A quick dip can suffice to remove most free starch without eliminating it entirely, preserving some binding properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52">[07:52]</a>.
2.  **Pan-Frying then Baking:** Brown one side of the *rösti* in a pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06">[08:06]</a>, then transfer it to an oven (e.g., 350°F/180°C for 10-20 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12">[08:12]</a>. This method allows the potatoes to cook down and bind together in the oven without the risk of burning the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18">[08:18]</a>.
3.  **Final Crisp:** Optionally, return the *rösti* to the oven on a rack after flipping and browning the second side to achieve extra crispness on the outside and push the inside closer to a mashed potato texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37">[08:37]</a>.

This technique yields a *rösti* that is crispy on the outside and not at all slimy on the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55">[08:55]</a>. However, introducing fat to the inside of the shreds (rather than just the pan) can make the overall *rösti* greasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34">[09:34]</a>.

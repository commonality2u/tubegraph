From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Mashed baked potatoes offer a distinctive flavor and texture compared to their boiled counterparts, primarily due to the higher temperatures achieved during baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

## Key Advantages

*   **Intense, Caramelized Flavor** Baking potatoes in the oven allows them to reach temperatures much higher than boiling water (which maxes out at 212°F / 100°C), leading to more intense and caramelized flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. Brown flavors do not develop at boiling temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
*   **Incredible Flavor** Mashed baked potatoes are noted for their "incredible flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

## Preparation and Texture Notes

While the flavor is more intense, mashed baked potatoes will not be as smooth as [[boiling_and_roasting_potatoes | boiled mashed potatoes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

To achieve the best and smoothest texture for mashed baked potatoes, a ricer is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. The flesh of baked potatoes can be too stiff for whipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. A rustic texture can be achieved by crushing the flesh with a fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

### Incorporating Aromatics and Fats

*   Butter: A significant amount of butter (e.g., a 7-ounce package) can be melted in a pan over medium heat to incorporate into the potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Cultured (fermented) butter can add a "zing" to the mash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   [[making_mashed_potatoes_with_garlic | Garlic]]: Half a head of chopped garlic can be added to the melting butter. The heat should then be turned off, allowing the garlic to cook gently without browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   Seasoning: Begin with a big pinch of salt, a glug of milk, and pepper, then stir to combine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Additional milk or seasoning can be added to taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. There's no discernible difference in the final product when using cold milk versus hot milk, and using cold milk avoids dirtying another dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

The [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | prickly pear cactus]], belonging to the *Opuntia* genus, is native to the Americas and has nearly every part of the plant considered edible and potentially quite tasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While there are hundreds of distinct species abundant in the warmer parts of the western hemisphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, all can be grown by simply sticking a piece of the plant into the ground, where it will send out roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Identifying the Fruit (Tuna)

The fruits of the prickly pear are known as "tuna" in Spanish, a word of indigenous American origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. These are true berries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, often appearing large and purple when ripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. They possess a soft, sweet, and sour flesh, encasing a pulpy core filled with small, hard seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. While the seeds are not poisonous, they are too hard to crunch through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Tuna typically ripen in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Harvesting Prickly Pear Fruit

To determine if a tuna fruit is ripe, look for it to be no longer green and able to twist almost effortlessly off the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. When harvesting, use a twisting motion rather than pulling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Safety During Harvesting: The Glochids Menace
The most significant hazard when dealing with prickly pear is the presence of nearly microscopic thorns called "glochids" or "glochidia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. These "hairy little demons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> are barbed and will hook into your skin and detach from the plant with even a slight brush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The barbed tips tend to break off and remain embedded in the skin, causing a minor but sharp pain under pressure, and a generalized dull ache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Some individuals may experience a strong inflammatory reaction or dermatitis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

To avoid glochids during harvesting, **always use tongs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. If contact occurs, researchers in the 1980s found that immediately removing visible glochid parts with tweezers and then applying household glue, letting it dry, and ripping it off can almost entirely prevent inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## [[eating_cactus_safely | Preparing Prickly Pear Fruit for Consumption]]

Consuming the fruit directly from the plant is a popular method among hikers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This involves using a stick to steady the fruit by poking its blossom end, then filleting off the skin with a knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Afterwards, the edible flesh can be filleted right off the seed core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Be aware that even ripe fruits may still have many glochids, so wipe any loose glochids off your knife before proceeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Removing Glochids from Fruit
Before extensive preparation, glochids must be removed from the fruit. Simply washing and scrubbing under running water may work for store-bought varieties, but wild prickly pears often require more rigorous methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>:

*   **Sand Rolling**: An ancient method involves rolling the fruits vigorously in sand, which abrasively dislodges the prickles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Fire**: Burning the glochids off with fire is an effective method. This can be done over a gas stove flame, with a kitchen torch, or even in a campfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The glochids will ignite and shrivel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Be careful not to keep them in the heat for too long, or they will burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

After heat treatment, fruits can be washed off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. While some suggest simply peeling the skin with fingers, using a fork to hold the fruit upright and filleting off the skin may be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Processing for Juice
Due to the large proportion of pulpy seeds compared to fruit flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, prickly pear fruits are often juiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. After peeling, mash the fruit by hand or blend it in a food processor with a little water to aid flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Then, strain out the hard seeds and pulp to obtain the juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Uses and Taste
The juice can be boiled down to [[making_fruit_syrups_at_home | make candies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, or mixed with simple syrup and lime juice for a refreshing soft drink called "agua fresca de tuna" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It can also be used as a mixer for alcoholic beverages, such as with tequila <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Prickly pear fruit has a generic fruity taste, but with a slight vegetal note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Less ripe fruits are more acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The taste is often described as "purple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

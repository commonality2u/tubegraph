Unlike beef or pork, chicken must always be cooked thoroughly to prevent foodborne illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. It is dangerous to eat rare chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Recommended Internal Temperature
Chicken should be cooked all the way through to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This temperature applies whether the chicken is ground, a whole piece, or an entire bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Why Chicken is Different
The reason for this strict [[cooking_techniques | cooking technique]] is due to the nature of pathogens in poultry. Unlike beef, where contaminants like E. coli and Salmonella are typically found on the surface of intact muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, pathogens in chicken can be internalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

        <p>This is a key difference when comparing the [[safety_of_eating_rare_steak_versus_rare_chicken | safety of eating rare steak versus rare chicken]] or other meats. For example, ground beef requires thorough cooking because surface contaminants get mixed throughout the meat during processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.</p>

Dr. Francisco Diaz Gonzalez, director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, explains:
> "chicken is there's plenty of evidence in the scientific literature that the pathogen bacteria can be internalized inside of the chicken pieces so you should not compromise and meaning a half cooked piece of chicken because that's the possibility you will find organisms such as Campylobacter or Salmonella that they're still alive and may still make you sick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

Therefore, to ensure safety, it is crucial to cook chicken completely through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

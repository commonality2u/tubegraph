Spaghetti all'Assassina, also known as "assassin's spaghetti" (feminine form of assassin), is a unique pasta dish originating from Bari in southeast Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Unlike most pasta dishes, it is prepared by frying the spaghetti rather than boiling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, resulting in a distinct flavor and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The sauce is typically spicy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Key Characteristics
*   **Frying Method:** The pasta is cooked directly in a tomato broth, allowing the bottom layer to fry and brown between additions of liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This is similar to the method used for making risotto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Flavor Profile:** The sauce is intensely sweet and sour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, cooked down to an almost jam-like consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The browned pasta contributes a smoky taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, with the flavor of the sauce permeating the noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Texture:** The pasta develops a toothy, crusty texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The sauce becomes velvety due to starch released from the pasta, similar to the mouthfeel of risotto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Ingredients
*   **Spaghetti:** Approximately half a pound (225 grams) for two large portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Cheaper pasta with a smooth, shiny surface is preferred over fancy bronze-cut pasta, as the latter sheds too much starch, making the sauce pasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Chilies:**
    *   **For Garnish:** Small, mild chilies like serrano chilies for pickling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
    *   **For Sauce:** Thickly sliced jalapenos (or dried red chili flakes, traditionally) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. White pith can be removed to reduce heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Garlic:** A large pile, peeled and chopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. No need for fine chopping as it will break down during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Tomatoes:** 10 ounces (283 grams) of fresh grape or cherry tomatoes for two portions, pureed smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Canned tomato puree can be used as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Tomato Paste:** A squeeze for concentrated tomato flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Olive Oil:** A generous film for frying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Salt:** To taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Vinegar:** Any type for pickling chilies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Sugar:** A pinch for pickling chilies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Basil:** Fresh leaves, torn, for a cooling contrast to the spicy sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **White Wine (Optional):** Can be splashed in to loosen the sauce or cook noodles further if tomato broth runs out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Preparation Steps

### 1. Prepare Garnish (Charred Pickled Chilies)
1.  In a small bowl, combine a big pinch of sugar, a pinch of salt, and some vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
2.  Char small, mild chilies (e.g., serrano) directly in a gas flame until almost blackened all over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Alternatively, use a kitchen torch or broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
3.  Add the hot charred chilies to the pickle solution. They will soften as they sit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### 2. Prepare Sauce Base
1.  Thickly slice jalapenos. Remove white pith if less heat is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  Peel and chop a large pile of garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
3.  Puree fresh grape or cherry tomatoes until smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Straining skins and seeds is optional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### 3. Make Tomato Broth
1.  Dilute the pureed fresh tomatoes (or canned tomato puree) with at least an equivalent volume of water to create a tomato broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
2.  Season the broth with a big pinch of salt until it tastes like a good soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### 4. Cook the Pasta (The Frying Method)
1.  Heat a generous film of olive oil in a non-stick (Teflon) pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. (A well-seasoned cast iron pan is traditional, but a non-stick pan makes it much easier and yields better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.)
2.  Add garlic and peppers to get a slight head start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
3.  Squeeze in some tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
4.  Pour a thin layer of the tomato broth into the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
5.  Break the dry spaghetti to fit the pan and lay it in the broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Nudge the strands into the sauce; this will also displace the garlic and peppers towards the rim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
6.  Wait for enough water to evaporate for the bottom layer of spaghetti to start browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. It will smell and sound different, with fizzing and popping indicating frying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
7.  Once the bottom layer is golden/deep brown, add another dose of tomato broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
8.  Stir to work the liquid in and flip the pasta so a different layer can brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Break apart any clumps that form, though they can be nice at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
9.  Repeat this process (fry, add broth, stir) until the pasta is cooked al dente <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Approximately four doses of broth may be enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
10. If the pasta needs more cooking but you're out of broth, or for a saucier texture, add water or white wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### 5. Finishing Touches
1.  Taste the pasta for seasoning and add more salt if needed before all the water evaporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
2.  Let the pan get very dry in the final stage to achieve maximum browning on the noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
3.  Tear in fresh basil leaves; their cooling sensation contrasts well with the spicy sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
4.  Optionally, add a little more wine to loosen the sauce as it will tighten upon plating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
5.  Serve and garnish with the quick pickled charred chilies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Traditional versus modern methods for pasta dishes
> While traditional Spaghetti all'Assassina is made in a well-seasoned cast iron pan, using a non-stick (Teflon) pan is recommended as it makes the dish significantly easier and yields better results, preventing the brown bits from sticking to the pan and keeping them on the noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

While the transcript is highly garbled, it appears to reference hamburgers and bread.

A "perm ham bird" is mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, which may be interpreted as "hamburger." The term "hamburger built" also appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Additionally, "bread" is referenced in a phrase that is difficult to fully decipher: "bread ending toutes ces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This suggests that bread is a component of a hamburger.

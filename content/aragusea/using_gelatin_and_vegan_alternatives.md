When making homemade marshmallows, gelatin is a key ingredient, with specific alternatives available for [[vegan_meatless_meals | vegan substitutions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Gelatin for Marshmallows
To prepare marshmallows, a quarter-ounce envelope of unflavored gelatin is poured into a mixing bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. A quarter cup of water is mixed into the gelatin, and it's left to hydrate for about a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. The recipe uses a proportionally large amount of gelatin to ensure firm marshmallows that do not melt instantaneously in hot chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Once the gelatin has bloomed, hot sugar syrup is slowly drizzled into it while beating with a hand mixer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Vegan Alternative: Agar-Agar
For a [[vegan_meatless_meals | vegan substitution]], two teaspoons of agar-agar powder can be used instead of gelatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

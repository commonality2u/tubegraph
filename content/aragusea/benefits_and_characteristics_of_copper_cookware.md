Copper cookware is prized for its aesthetic appeal and unique physical and chemical properties in the kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While some cookware uses copper layers sandwiched within stainless steel, pure solid copper offers specific advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Exceptional Heat Conduction
Copper is an incredible heat conductor, making it highly effective for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It is far more thermally conductive than stainless steel, approximately 25 times more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. While aluminum is cheaper and also conductive, copper is almost twice as thermally conductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Only silver and diamond surpass copper in thermal conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

This property ensures that copper cookware heats up very quickly and distributes heat evenly, preventing hot spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This even heating is particularly beneficial for delicate tasks like candy making, which requires consistent, high heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Beneficial Chemical Reactivity
Copper's chemical reactivity, which can sometimes be a concern with acidic foods, is precisely why it's historically preferred for certain culinary applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Beating Egg Whites
In classical European cooking, a copper bowl is the traditional choice for beating egg whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This practice specifically uses unlined copper bowls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. When egg whites are beaten in a copper bowl, copper ions interact with an egg protein called ovotransferrin (or conalbumin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. These complexes make the egg foam more stable during beating and subsequent cooking, as they are less reactive to temperature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Other research suggests copper ions may bond with sulfur groups on egg proteins, preventing the formation of strong disulfide bonds that can make the foam brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Experiments show that egg whites beaten in a copper bowl achieve stiff peaks faster (90 seconds vs. 120 seconds in stainless steel) and produce a more stable foam that leaks less water over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Alcohol Distillation
[[historical_and_traditional_uses_of_copper_in_cooking | Copper's affinity for sulfur]] is also why it's used in alcohol distillation vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. In stills, copper pulls sulfur compounds out of the distillate when it's in vapor form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This is particularly beneficial for brandies, which are distilled from wine containing sulfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Without copper, these sulfur compounds, which taste like rotten eggs, would be detectable in the final spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Workability and Historical Significance
Copper was likely the first metal used by humans, often found in its pure elemental form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Unlike iron, which requires smelting from ore, copper can be worked cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It is super malleable, meaning it can be easily formed into shapes with a hammer, and very ductile, allowing it to be drawn into thin wires like those used in whisks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Specific Applications
### Jam Pans
Pure copper pots, known as jam pans, are still commonly used for making sweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The presence of a high sugar concentration in the solution seems to prevent copper from leaching into the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The excellent thermal conductivity of copper allows jam to cook very quickly, potentially helping to retain volatile fruity flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Considerations
While [[Copper cookware and chemical reactivity | copper's chemical reactivity]] is beneficial for specific tasks, it's also why [[safety_concerns_with_copper_cookware_and_moscow_mules | traditional copper pans are often lined]] with inert materials like tin or stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Acidic foods can leach copper into food, which is toxic in high or chronic excessive doses, though a small amount is an essential micronutrient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

The high thermal conductivity means that unlined copper cookware, like a mug, can quickly transfer heat from the room into a cold drink, warming it up faster than an insulated material like ceramic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. However, the feeling of the cold copper vessel on the lips can enhance the perceived coldness and overall experience of a drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Copper can also enhance the astringency of certain drinks through interactions with saliva proteins, contributing to the overall taste experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

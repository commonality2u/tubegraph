When [[making_homemade_tomato_sauce | making homemade tomato sauce]] for dishes like spaghetti al-assasina, there are distinct advantages and methods for using either fresh tomatoes or precooked sauce products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>.

## Advantages of Fresh Tomatoes
For a dish where the sauce undergoes extensive cooking, such as the unique frying method of al-assasina pasta, starting with whole fresh tomatoes is recommended over a pre-cooked tomato sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>. This approach ensures that some bright freshness remains even after the sauce is thoroughly cooked down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### Recommended Fresh Tomatoes
In many mainstream grocery stores, grape or cherry tomatoes are often the best fresh tomato options for sauce, remaining good in any season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:15">[01:48:15]</a>. For two portions, a 10-ounce (283-gram) container is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:21">[01:58:21]</a>.

### Preparation of Fresh Tomatoes
Fresh tomatoes should be pureed as smooth as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:03">[02:03:03]</a>. While straining out skins and seeds is an option, it's generally considered unnecessary because the fiber is beneficial and the pieces become so small they are unnoticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

### Flavor Profile with Fresh Tomatoes
The intense cooking process can reduce the fresh tomato sauce to an almost jam-like consistency, resulting in a very sweet flavor, especially when using naturally sweeter grape tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

## Use of Precooked Tomato Sauce
If a food processor is unavailable for pureeing fresh tomatoes, using a canned tomato puree is a practical alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. Alternatively, a jar or can of existing tomato sauce can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

### Dilution of Precooked Sauce
When using a jar or can of tomato sauce, it should be diluted, ideally with about two parts water to one part sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

## General Preparation for Both Types
Regardless of whether fresh tomatoes or a precooked product is used, the traditional approach for this dish is to dilute the tomato base into a "tomato broth" by adding at least an equivalent volume of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:22">[02:21:22]</a>. A big pinch of salt should be added to make it taste like a good soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

Additionally, a squeeze of tomato paste can be included to provide a concentrated, highly reduced tomato flavor that fresh tomatoes might not fully deliver on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

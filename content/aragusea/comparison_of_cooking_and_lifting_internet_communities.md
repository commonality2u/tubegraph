From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

The internet communities dedicated to cooking and lifting share a fundamental problem: unproductive arguments and flawed patterns of thought prevail in both spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This issue stems from a simple fact: within a reasonable range of possibility, "everything basically works" in both cooking and lifting, meaning "everyone is basically right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Core Problem: "Everything Basically Works"

In both cooking and lifting, many debates revolve around minor variations that yield negligible differences in outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Lifting Examples
For instance, in lifting, a common [[debates_and_arguments_in_cooking_and_lifting_techniques | debate]] centers on side laterals, an exercise for shoulder muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. One argument insists on internally rotating the arm (pinkies up), while another advocates for externally rotating (thumbs up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Although studies might show a slight increase in muscle activation with external rotation, the actual difference in muscle growth or strength gain is often very small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The most critical factors for wider shoulder muscles are consistently lifting heavy objects away from the body until failure, using a weight that allows 10-12 repetitions, adequate rest, consistent effort, genetics, and diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Dietary protein, for example, is essential for muscle growth, highlighting the importance of nutrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Cooking Examples
Similarly, in cooking, a common [[debates_and_arguments_in_cooking_and_lifting_techniques | argument]] is between classical searing (searing the outside first, then bringing the interior to temperature) and reverse searing (bringing the interior to temperature first, then searing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Both methods, when properly executed, produce excellent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The differences in outcomes are often so minor that other variables could easily account for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Complexity of Outcomes and Variable Isolation
Outcomes in both the kitchen and the gym are typically the result of numerous factors, making it challenging to isolate specific variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For example, professional bodybuilders often use partial range of motion on exercises like the bench press and have massive chests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. However, their results are influenced by genetics, pharmaceutical enhancement, professional training, and precisely formulated diets, not just their specific form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. They cannot definitively know which specific technique is the "secret" to their success because they do not test variables in isolation over long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## The Role of Science and "Bro Science"
For isolated variable testing, scientists are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. However, scientific studies in these areas have significant limitations:

*   **Small Sample Sizes**: Lifting studies, even on competitive bodybuilders, often involve very small groups (e.g., 10 participants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Measurement Limitations**: Studies might measure muscle activation via EMG, but the correlation between EMG readings and actual muscle growth or strength gain is an ongoing [[role_of_science_and_studies_in_cooking_and_bodybuilding | scientific debate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Ethical Constraints**: It is far easier to study "things" (like food) by destroying them than to conduct long-term, controlled experiments on humans that might harm their physiques or lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Funding Priorities**: Significant scientific investment in food science tends to be in industrial manufacturing or public health/safety, not in answering basic questions about everyday cooking or cosmetic fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Normal vs. Enhanced Populations**: Lifting studies often focus on "normal" humans, meaning professional bodybuilders operate beyond the explored frontiers of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

Because of this lack of definitive scientific answers for many common questions, "bro science" – informal, often anecdotal knowledge – fills the void in both communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Obsession with Minutiae
Both cooking and lifting involve highly repetitive activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This repetition frees up mental energy, leading to an obsession with often inconsequential minutiae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   In cooking, this might include debates over optimal knife angles, peeling garlic, or whether crushing garlic extracts more flavor than cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   In lifting, it could be obsessing over "little kind of angles of alignment" or the precise balance of high sets/low reps versus low sets/high reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

Ultimately, these tiny variables make a negligible difference compared to fundamental practices like consistency, effort, and progressive overload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Exacerbation by the Content Marketplace
The online content marketplace further exacerbates this obsession. Content creators in both fields need new topics to discuss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This often leads to refuting "stupid" methods or creating videos testing slightly different ways to do things, only to conclude that "they all basically taste the same" or have minimal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

## The Positive Aspect: Asking Fundamental Questions
Despite these issues, both lifting and cooking discourse force individuals to ask fundamental questions about "why we do what we do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

*   **Lifting Goals**: When performing a deadlift, one must consider the [[personal_goals_and_motivations_in_cooking_and_lifting | goal]]: is it to move the most weight (perhaps using straps to aid grip), or to be able to pick up heavy objects in the "real world" where grip assistance isn't available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>? This prompts a focus on strengthening weak links like grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. A personal story highlights this: the speaker prioritized being able to function and play with his infant son over achieving maximum gains, leading him to reduce weight on lower body exercises to avoid severe soreness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

*   **Cooking Goals**: Sauce making presents a similar [[personal_goals_and_motivations_in_cooking_and_lifting | dilemma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Is the goal to have a thick, delicious sauce (which starch can achieve instantaneously), or to adhere to a "classical" European method of thickening by reduction (which takes longer but is considered "proper") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>? The fundamental question becomes: "am I trying to have something good to eat or am I trying to make something good to eat?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. If the goal is simply to eat well, then using prepared ingredients is not "cheating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

Ultimately, after achieving a basic level of competency, it becomes more productive to obsess over *why* one engages in these activities rather than *how* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

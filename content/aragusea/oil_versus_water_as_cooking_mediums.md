When cooking, nearly every recipe begins with adding a film of oil to a pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While it might seem like the primary reason is to prevent sticking, oil plays a much more significant [[role_of_oil_in_cooking | role]] in the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## The Role of Oil
Oil, or any liquid fat, serves as a [[thermal_interfaces_in_cooking | thermal interface]] between the pan and the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Because the pan surface is rigid and the food is not, only small bits of food make direct contact with the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Oil effectively fills these gaps, reaching up to "grab" bits of food floating just above the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Oil is an excellent conductor of heat, which means energy from the pan is transmitted into more parts of the food than the pan itself could reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This efficient heat transfer leads to:
*   **Even Browning:** The entire surface of the food heats up, resulting in a broad smudge of golden brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, such as with Brussels sprouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Faster Cooking:** Food cooks more thoroughly and quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example, oiled Brussels sprouts were very brown and tender in 6 minutes, while unoiled ones were still hard after 11 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Flavor Development:** Fats interact with other substances at high temperatures to create delicious flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Cooking Without Oil
[[cooking_without_oil | Cooking without oil]] yields distinct results:
*   **Sticking:** While not always the most important factor, food, especially meat proteins, can stick to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Proteins form complexes with metal atoms at high temperatures, literally bonding to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Localized Browning:** Heat on the food is more localized to the few points making actual contact with the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This results in patches of black with clearly defined borders, rather than an even golden brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Slower Cooking & Uneven Texture:** The overall heat of the food is lower, causing it to cook very slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Parts of the outside may burn before the inside is tender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This leads to a mixture of overdone and underdone areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Less Flavor:** Unoiled food may lack the rich flavor developed with oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Water as a Thermal Interface
Water can also act as a [[thermal_interfaces_in_cooking | thermal interface]] and heat-conducting medium, wrapping itself around the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Food is boiled in water for similar reasons it's fried in fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. A thin film of water can be used in a sauté to fill gaps between food and the pan, conducting heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### [[comparison_of_thermal_interfaces_oil_vs_water | Comparison of Thermal Interfaces: Oil vs. Water]]
Water, despite being a dietary choice for those managing calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, has distinct disadvantages compared to oil for browning and sautéing:

*   **Temperature Limitations:**
    *   Most cooking oils can reach temperatures of 400°F (200°C) before breaking down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   Water, under normal atmospheric pressure, can only reach 212°F (100°C) before becoming steam and evaporating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

*   **Browning Reactions:**
    *   [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | Maillard reactions]] and caramelization, which are responsible for browning, start around 330°F (165°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   Water simply cannot get hot enough under normal conditions for these reactions to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

*   **Viscosity and Coating:**
    *   Water is less viscous than fat, so it does not coat food as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. For water to be an effective thermal interface, food generally needs to be submerged (boiled) or enclosed in steam (steamed with a lid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

*   **Evaporation and Cooking Time:**
    *   Water evaporates, requiring constant replenishment in a sauté <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   Food cooked with water without submerging takes a very long time; for example, broccoli took 15 minutes and was still not tender, compared to 6 minutes with oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## [[effects_of_oil_on_nonstick_and_oven_cooking | Effects of Oil on Nonstick and Oven Cooking]]
### Non-Stick Pans
Even in a non-stick pan, oil is still needed as a [[thermal_interfaces_in_cooking | thermal interface]] and for its flavor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Without oil, steam can push the food away from the hot surface, leading to uneven cooking and repulsive patches of gray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Oven Cooking
The difference oil makes in oven cooking is not as significant as in pan cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. While the top surface of oiled and unoiled vegetables may brown similarly, the side touching the pan shows a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Oiled vegetables get a beautiful golden brown where they contact the metal, whereas unoiled vegetables show uneven coloration, a mixture of burned and pale, and can be dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. For meat like beef roast, the difference might be negligible if enough natural fat renders out to coat the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Beyond Heat Transfer: Preventing Stickage and Flavor
While heat transfer is crucial, fats also prevent food from sticking to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Oils, being liquid fats, spread across the pan to form a barrier between proteins and the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. An effective [[thermal_interfaces_in_cooking | thermal interface]] cooks the surface of the meat faster and more thoroughly, and a well-browned crust releases more easily from the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Fats are also essential nutrients and facilitate the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

Microwaving frozen peas offers a convenient and effective way to prepare a simple vegetable side dish, often alongside a meal like roast chicken and [[making_mashed_potatoes_with_garlic | mashed potatoes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Why Frozen Peas?

Using frozen peas is a practical choice, especially if high-quality fresh peas are not readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. They serve as an excellent complement to a meal, particularly good for "hitchhiking" on a forkful of [[making_mashed_potatoes_with_garlic | mashed potatoes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## Preparation

To prepare frozen peas for microwaving:
1.  Place approximately four cups of frozen peas into a microwave-safe jug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
2.  Cover the peas with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Cooking Method

1.  Place the microwave-safe jug with peas and water into the microwave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
2.  Microwave for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This short cooking time is efficient, allowing for other tasks like carving a chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
3.  The peas are ready when the water they are in is boiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Finishing and Serving

1.  Strain the cooked peas from the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  Add a little butter and salt to the strained peas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
3.  Stir the peas to allow the butter to melt and distribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

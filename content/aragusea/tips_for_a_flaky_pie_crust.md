Achieving a perfectly flaky pie crust is a hallmark of delicious baking. Several key techniques, from ingredient selection to dough handling, contribute to this desirable texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Ingredients and Preparation

For a truly flaky crust, the fat within the dough must remain cold and in distinct pieces until it bakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

*   **Cold Butter:** Use cold, salted butter, cut into small chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. If the butter is not cold, it will melt in the food processor, leading to a less flaky result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The goal is to have many tiny, solid globs of butter throughout the flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. When these globs are rolled out, they create the flaky layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Chilling Dough:** [[making_pastry_dough | Pastry dough]] must be chilled in the refrigerator before it can be rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. After mixing, wrap the dough and place it in the fridge to chill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Incorporating Liquids

Traditionally, cold water is used to bring the dough together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, adding white wine to the crust can impart sweetness and fragrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

*   When using wine, pour in about a tablespoon at a time, whisking and checking the texture until it reaches the right consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:05]</a>. The dough should be able to squish into a small flake between your fingers, even if it looks dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Dough Handling Techniques

The way you handle the dough significantly impacts its final texture.

*   **Minimal Working:** After adding the liquid, barely bring the dough together into a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:24]</a>. The less the dough is worked at this stage, the more crumbly and flaky the crust will be later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:30]</a>.

> If your pastry is difficult to roll out, it's often a good sign that it will result in a crumbly, flaky, and delicious crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:59]</a>. A dough that is too easy to work with often leads to a solid, chewy crust rather than a flaky one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Rolling the Dough

Proper rolling technique is crucial for developing the flaky layers.

*   **Flour and Turn:** Flour your work surface and the top of the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:21]</a>. Roll a little, then turn the dough, and repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:24]</a>. Turning ensures the dough doesn't stick and helps to roll it out more evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Trust the Process:** The dough may appear to be breaking apart initially, but as it warms slightly during rolling, the small beads of butter will stretch into sheets, and it will begin to resemble a cohesive dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Repairing Tears:** If a hole forms, simply grab some excess dough from another corner and press it into the tear to patch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:52]</a>. As you continue rolling, everything will smush together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Sizing:** Roll the dough large enough to have at least an inch of excess on all sides of your pie dish. This excess helps form a seal and provides delicious, crunchy edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Baking for Flakiness

*   **Egg Wash:** Apply an egg wash (egg whisked with water) around the edge of the pie dish to help glue the crust to the dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:23]</a>. Brush egg wash over the entire top of the pastry before baking to help it brown and become shiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Steam Release:** Some people pierce holes in the crust to release steam, though often, one or two holes will open up naturally during baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Baking Temperature:** Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:09]</a>. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Resting:** Allow the pie to rest for at least 10 minutes after baking before cutting into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:35]</a>. Flour-thickened sauces thin out when hot and thicken as they cool, so resting allows the sauce to cling to the filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:32]</a>.

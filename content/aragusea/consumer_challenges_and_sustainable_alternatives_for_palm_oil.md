Palm oil is the most consumed plant oil globally, found in countless processed foods, soaps, cosmetics, and biofuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Its prevalence raises concerns, particularly from an [[environmental_impacts_of_palm_oil_production | environmental standpoint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## What is Palm Oil?

Palm oil is a fat derived from the fruit of the oil palm tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. There are two main types:
*   **Palm oil** (from the fruit's meat): This is obtained by crushing the fruit and is primarily used in food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Palm kernel oil** (from the fruit's kernel): This is obtained by crushing the seed inside the fruit and is mostly used in cosmetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

In its unrefined, traditional form, such as that made in Ghana, palm oil from the fruit is reddish-orange due to carotenoids (like those in carrots and tomatoes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. It has a strong, bitter, and vegetal taste, with an aroma similar to a spice drawer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Properties
Palm oil is semi-solid at room temperature because it is 50% saturated fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Palm kernel oil is even more saturated, at about 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Their high saturation makes them behave more like animal fats, remaining solid or semi-solid at room temperature and being less prone to oxidation or rancidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This natural saturation is a rare property for a plant oil; for instance, coconut oil is about 90% saturated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. However, coconut palm trees do not yield as much oil as oil palm trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## [[history_and_production_of_palm_oil | History and Production of Palm Oil]]

The oil palm tree is native to West Africa, where its oil has been used for thousands of years as a cooking oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Rise to Global Prominence
The modern palm oil industry's story begins with the introduction of the African oil palm tree to Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Most of today's palm oil comes from Malaysia and Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The plant thrives in the tropical belt, roughly 10 degrees north and south of the equator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

The initial infrastructure for the palm oil trade in West Africa was repurposed from the outlawed slave trade by British traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Canoes previously used for human trafficking were then used to transport palm oil from the Niger Delta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. During the Second Industrial Revolution, palm oil became significant for making soaps (due to factory work leading to increased demand for cleanliness), lighting lamps, and eventually, margarine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Factors contributing to palm oil's widespread adoption include:
*   **Natural Saturation:** Unlike many unsaturated vegetable oils (e.g., cottonseed oil), palm oil is naturally saturated, behaving like animal fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This means it doesn't require industrial hydrogenation processes, which historically created unhealthy trans fats (as seen with Crisco) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The shift away from trans fats in processed foods significantly boosted palm oil's market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **High Productivity:** The oil palm is remarkably productive, yielding far more oil per acre than any other oil crop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Modern breeding in Southeast Asia has resulted in shorter, thicker-trunked trees that are easier to harvest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Cheapness:** Its high productivity and exploitative practices contribute to its extreme affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

After independence, governments in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia encouraged oil palm cultivation as a poverty alleviation scheme, providing land and seedlings to poor citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## [[Environmental impacts of palm oil production | Environmental and Social Concerns]]

Despite its economic benefits, the modern palm oil industry is associated with significant environmental and social problems:

### Environmental Devastation
*   **Deforestation:** The expansion of palm oil plantations has led to massive deforestation of vital tropical rainforests, contributing to global warming and devastating natural habitats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Habitat Loss:** Critically, orangutans are losing their homes to oil palm expansion, though many other species are also affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Water Pollution:** Rivers near plantations can be poisoned by agrichemicals used in cultivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### Social Issues
*   **Stolen Land:** In countries like Liberia, governments rent jungle land to large companies for palm oil production. This land is often inhabited by people living traditional lifestyles who are less able to assert their rights and receive only tiny payments for displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Governments often prioritize corporate interests, sometimes due to corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   [[labor_issues_in_the_palm_oil_industry | Labor Abuses]]: In Malaysia and Indonesia, a reliance on imported labor from countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar (including Rohingya refugees) is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Many are trafficked under false pretenses, have passports confiscated, and are forced to work off debt to recruiters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## [[health_implications_of_palm_oil_consumption | Health Implications]]

While medical science regards trans fats as "the worst kind of fat that you can eat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, and palm oil has replaced them in many products due to its natural saturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, its high saturated fat content (50%) still raises health questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. In India, where it is widely used as a cooking oil and in snacks due to its low cost, there is a stigma around it, partly because it's not domestically grown and partly because people "sort of know that it's not healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## Consumer Challenges

For a conscientious consumer, avoiding palm oil is challenging:
*   **Ubiquitous Presence:** While about two-thirds of palm oil is consumed in foods, particularly in pre-packaged baked goods requiring shelf-stable solid fats, it is also found in a vast array of non-food items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

*   **Labeling Issues:** Identifying palm oil on labels is difficult because it can be fractionated and listed under numerous different names in countless products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   **Ineffective Certifications:** Labels from organizations like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) are meant to indicate sustainable sourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. However, workers on RSPO-certified plantations have reported being coached with scripts before inspector visits and being punished or fired if they didn't follow the script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Furthermore, tracing the origin of palm oil is difficult once it's blended in the international commodities market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Sustainable Alternatives and Broader Solutions

There are no easy solutions, but some approaches include:
*   **Reduced Consumption:** For consumers in the United States, a general reduction in overall consumption is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Responsible Sourcing:** Tiny segments of the market offer palm oil sourced from small-holder farms that work with natural habitats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Acknowledge Complexity:** While other vegetable oils exist, they all have their own problems and typically require far more land to produce the same amount of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. It's considered unhelpful to focus consumption guilt on one product, ingredient, or company, as this can lead to ignoring equally problematic issues elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

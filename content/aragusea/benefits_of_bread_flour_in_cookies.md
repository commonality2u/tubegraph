When making [[chocolate_chip_cookie_recipe_variation | chocolate chip cookies]], the choice of flour can influence the final texture. Using bread flour is an unconventional approach that offers specific textural benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Impact on Texture

The primary perceived benefit of incorporating bread flour into a cookie recipe is the achievement of a smoother texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. While the initial expectation might be that the high protein content of bread flour would result in a [[baking_techniques_and_their_effects_on_bread_characteristics | chewier texture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, this doesn't appear to be the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Instead, the dough acquires a smoothness that the baker prefers, though it is noted as "hard to describe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The amount of flour can be adjusted based on desired cookie thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. Starting with two cups and adding more until the desired texture is achieved is a recommended method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Approximately two and a half cups of flour might be used in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. The ideal consistency is a dough that appears wet but is not very sticky, pulling away easily from the fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

> If a thinner cookie is desired, less flour should be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Recipe Context

This use of bread flour is part of a specific [[chocolate_chip_cookie_recipe_variation | cookie recipe variation]] that includes:
*   [[use_of_melted_butter_and_sugar_in_baking | Melted salted butter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>
*   Two full cups of sugar for texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Molasses as a substitute for brown sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Vanilla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Two whole eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   Two teaspoons of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   One teaspoon of baking soda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>

The dough is also [[chilling_cookie_dough_for_improved_texture | refrigerated for at least 30 minutes]] before baking to make it easier to work with and to prevent excessive spreading, which can be an issue when using [[use_of_melted_butter_and_sugar_in_baking | melted butter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

Notably, this recipe also utilizes a unique [[broiling_method_for_cookies | broiling method]] to achieve a visually appealing golden top before baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

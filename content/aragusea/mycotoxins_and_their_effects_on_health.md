Mycotoxins are chemical compounds produced by molds (fungi) that are not essential for the mold's basic growth and reproduction, but can be toxic to humans and other organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. These compounds are a type of [[differences_between_harmful_and_benign_molds | secondary metabolite]] released by molds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. They are believed to be involved in communication with other molds or as defenses against other microbes in the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. The "moldy dank smell" often associated with mold is actually a chemical signal molds release as they grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

## Presence and Spread in Food
Mycotoxins are not confined to the visible part of the mold, such as the spores on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. The majority of the mold organism, known as the mycelia, spreads throughout the food, particularly in soft and open structures like bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. This hidden mycelia is likely where many of these chemicals are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. Furthermore, ongoing research suggests that the mycotoxin itself can migrate beyond the visible mold body into the surrounding food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. This internal spread of the fungus and/or its toxins is more likely in foods that are soft or wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

## Health Impacts of Mycotoxins

The diversity of mold species makes it challenging to determine the exact danger posed by mold on food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. However, mycotoxins can indeed be dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

### Acute Toxicity
Eating a large amount of mold at once, or a highly toxic variety, can lead to immediate and severe sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. If accidental ingestion doesn't cause immediate symptoms like vomiting or paralysis, it suggests the mycotoxin wasn't very toxic or the amount consumed was insufficient to cause acute sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

### Chronic Exposure and Long-Term Health Problems
Scientists believe that repeated exposure to small amounts of mold over many years could cause serious long-term health problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Chronic exposure to mycotoxins has been linked to a range of health issues, including:
*   **Cancer**: Mycotoxins can damage DNA, which may lead to cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
*   **Organ Damage**: They can damage organs responsible for filtering ingested substances, such as the liver, kidneys, and spleen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.
*   **Immunosuppression**: Mycotoxins can suppress the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to other diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.

It is difficult for scientists to precisely determine the extent of mycotoxin-induced health problems due to the myriad of other exposures individuals face throughout their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

### Populations at Risk
*   **Developing Countries**: There are significant concerns for people in developing countries who rely heavily on one or two staple grains, potentially leading to repeated exposure to the same mycotoxin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Hot and humid climates, common in many developing nations, are conducive to fungal growth, and sanitation conditions for grain storage may be suboptimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
*   **Occupational Exposure**: Individuals in certain professions, such as mill workers, may experience occupational exposure to mycotoxins by breathing them in all day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

## [[food_safety_tips_for_mold_prevention | Food Safety Recommendations]]
Food safety experts generally advise against risking it when it comes to moldy food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Soft/Wet Foods**: For foods like bread, yogurt, soft cheeses, and soft fruits and vegetables, if they are moldy, they should be discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.
*   **Firm Foods**: With firm foods such as carrots, hard cheeses, and dry-cured meats, it may be possible to cut away the moldy part and an additional inch or so around it, making the remaining food safe to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. This is because the interior of solid foods is less likely to be affected by mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.
*   **Preventing Mold Growth**: To minimize the risk of mold growth on susceptible foods, keep them tightly wrapped, as mold needs air to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. However, mold will eventually appear if nutrients are available and the food is not too acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.

## Intentional Molds in Food
Some cheeses are intentionally inoculated with mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. These molds break down fats in the cheese, creating distinct flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. Molds used in foods like blue cheese or brie have been intentionally cultivated and effectively domesticated by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. These specific strains are selected for favorable flavors and appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a> and are known to have a "down regulation" of secondary metabolites that could lead to off-flavors or mycotoxins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. Despite this, some individuals may still have adverse reactions to the molds intentionally used in cheeses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>.

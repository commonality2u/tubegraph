Making a great pan pizza involves specific choices for seasonings and toppings, from the dough itself to the final garnishes. This guide outlines popular and recommended additions for a flavorful pan pizza experience.

## Dough Seasoning

For a thick crust pizza, a dash of garlic powder can be incorporated directly into the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While effective for thick crusts, too much garlic powder might burn in a thin crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Pan Oil Seasoning

Before adding the dough to the pan, season a small amount of olive oil used to coat the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. A pinch of dried oregano, basil, chili flakes, and a tiny pinch of salt can be mixed into the oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This creates a distinct layer of flavor on the bottom of the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Sauce Seasoning

For [[innovative_sauce_and_flavor_combinations_for_pizza | pizza sauce]], consider the following seasonings:
*   **Marjoram:** Described as smelling like tea but tasting like a cross between oregano and thyme, marjoram is a favored herb for pizza sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Traditional Herbs:** Oregano and basil are classic choices that complement the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Additional Spices:** A tiny pinch of sugar, a little chili flakes, black pepper, and a dab of olive oil can also be stirred into the sauce for enhanced flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Cheese Selection

For pan pizza, part-skim, low-moisture mozzarella is often preferred over whole milk varieties because it tends to brown better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. It is also more readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

It is important to avoid pre-grated cheese for pan pizza. The anti-clumping starch in pre-grated cheese is particularly prone to burning with certain [[baking_techniques_for_pizza_at_home | baking techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

Grated parmesan (often the pre-grated type, which some prefer for pizza over fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano) should be layered over the sauce and under the mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This placement helps prevent the parmesan from burning while enhancing the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The crispy cheese that forms on the edges of the pan is known as frico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Finishing Topping: Gremolata

A recommended fresh topping is gremolata, a traditional Italian garnish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. It consists of:
*   A tiny clove of fresh garlic, used sparingly because raw garlic is very strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   A couple of shavings of lemon zest, ensuring as little of the white pith as possible is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   A small bunch of fresh parsley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Chopping these three ingredients together can create a chemical reaction that results in a flavor greater than the sum of its parts, making dishes taste fresher and more sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This topping is typically sprinkled on the pizza after it comes out of the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

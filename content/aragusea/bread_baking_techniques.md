Aging pizza dough in the refrigerator for up to a week can result in a "pizza bread" that is incredibly crispy and flavorful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This method, while similar in concept to traditional [[cooking techniques | cooking techniques]] using sourdough starters or biga, simplifies the process by leveraging refrigeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Ingredients for Pizza Dough

To prepare the dough for cold-aging, a large batch of standard pizza dough is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:
*   ½ cup warm water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   2 teaspoons sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   2 teaspoons yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   4 cups more water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   2 tablespoons sugar (additional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   2 tablespoons salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   Approximately ¼ cup olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   10 cups bread flour (initial amount, more may be added during kneading) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

## Dough Preparation

1.  **Activate Yeast:** Combine ½ cup warm water with two teaspoons of sugar and two teaspoons of yeast. Stir and allow it to bloom for five minutes to ensure the yeast is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This step can be skipped if you're confident in your yeast's viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  **Combine Wet Ingredients:** Add four more cups of water, two additional tablespoons of sugar, two tablespoons of salt, and a generous amount of olive oil (about a quarter cup) to the yeast mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Stir well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
3.  **Mix and Knead:** Begin by adding ten cups of bread flour and bring the dough together with a spatula as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Then, use your hands to knead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Pizza dough benefits from being wet and sticky for better flavor and texture, so add just enough flour to make kneading feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Knead until the dough can be stretched thin without tearing, which took seven minutes in this demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Cold Aging Process (for [[baking_techniques_and_their_effects_on_bread_characteristics | Effects on Bread Characteristics]])

The dough is divided into portions and aged in the refrigerator, observing changes day by day. Glass containers are recommended to prevent chemical leaching during the long rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. A little olive oil in each container, coating the dough, helps it brown at home oven temperatures, as does the added sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Each portion for a 12-13 inch pizza or pizza bread is approximately 300 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The samples are labeled and placed directly into the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. It's not necessary to let the dough rise at room temperature before refrigeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Day-by-Day Observations:

*   **Day 0 (No cold rise):** Dough is allowed to rise on the table for two hours and baked immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   **Appearance:** Smooth top and bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   **Interior:** Large bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   **Taste/Texture:** Bland flavor, very soft and pillowy texture, not crispy, only slightly chewy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Considered an "inferior product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

*   **Day 1 (24 hours cold rise):** Dough has risen significantly in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   **Appearance:** Underside is rougher and bubbly, which helps hold more oil for crisping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Dough is stiffer and easier to handle when cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   **Interior:** Finer bubble structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. A slow, cold rise creates the same amount of air but divided into more, smaller bubbles, which is preferred for pizza crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   **Taste/Texture:** Flavor is still a bit flat, but texture is less pillowy, with some crunch and chew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

*   **Day 2 (48 hours cold rise):** Dough is stickier and starts to smell faintly like beer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
    *   **Taste/Texture:** Still a little pillowy in a negative way, but the flavor is improved, showing a yeasty, fermented note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

*   **Day 3 (72 hours cold rise):** Dough becomes very sticky with an uneven, bubbly underside, ideal for holding oil and crisping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
    *   **Texture:** Surface is noticeably crispier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This crispiness is speculated to be due to starches breaking down into simpler sugars that caramelize more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   **Appearance:** Starts to develop a glassy top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

*   **Day 4 (4 days cold rise):** A delicious smell akin to ripe banana is noted in both the raw and cooked dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

*   **Day 5 (5 days cold rise):** Dough appears very gooey; it would be nearly impossible to handle if not cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
    *   **Flavor:** Insane flavor with a funky, complex ripe banana note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

*   **Day 6 (6 days cold rise):** The top gets very crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   **Texture:** The interior becomes significantly chewier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Given enough time, gluten in a wet dough can develop itself, effectively "kneading" the dough for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

*   **Day 7 (Full week cold rise):** Dough is super gooey and sticky, difficult to handle even when cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
    *   **Appearance:** The underside, now cooked as the top, is very craggy, allowing oil to soak in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   **Texture/Flavor:** Exceptionally crispy top, and the flavor is complex, comparable to sourdough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## [[baking_techniques_for_perfect_crust | Baking Techniques for Perfect Crust]]

For the "pizza bread," these [[baking_techniques_for_pizza_at_home | baking techniques for pizza at home]] are applied:
1.  **Prepare the Dough:** Once removed from the fridge, stretch the dough into an oval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The dough is easier to handle when cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
2.  **Seasoning:** Coat the surface with plenty of olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Grind on pepper (be cautious, as too much can be overpowering in aged dough) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, shake over plenty of garlic powder (which provides an umami taste, different from fresh garlic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, and sprinkle a good amount of large, crunchy flaky salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Be careful not to let the garlic powder burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
3.  **Preheat Baking Surface:** A pizza stone is preferred over a pizza steel for this bread, as the steel tends to burn the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The pizza stone should be preheated for at least half an hour at maximum convection oven temperature (e.g., 550°F / whatever your oven can manage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
4.  **Baking:** Carefully remove the hot stone from the oven and drop the dough onto it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Bake until brown, typically 7-8 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
5.  **Cooling:** Pull the baked bread off the stone with tongs and place it on a cooling rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
6.  **Serving:** Cut the bread lengthwise, then into smaller strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Benefits of Cold-Aging Dough

This cold-aging method offers a simple way to achieve complex flavors and textures in bread without the maintenance of a traditional sourdough starter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The refrigerated environment allows for a slow fermentation that develops flavor, crispiness, and chewiness over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

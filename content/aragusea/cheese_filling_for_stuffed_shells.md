The [[stuffed_shells_recipe | cheese filling]] for stuffed shells is a classic component of Italian-American entrees, often believed by children to be a core ingredient in many pasta, red sauce, and ricotta cheese dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This specific filling recipe is designed to produce the correct quantity for a one-pound bag of pasta shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Ingredients

The cheese filling is primarily made with a blend of cheeses and other ingredients to achieve a smooth and flavorful texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

*   **Ricotta Cheese** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>
    *   1.5 pounds (680 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
    *   Full-fat ricotta is preferred for taste, but part-skim works fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
    *   Ricotta is a cottage cheese-type product, recooked from whey left over from other cheese making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
    *   It is relatively lean and high in protein, making it the primary bulk ingredient for the dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Mozzarella Cheese** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>
    *   1 pound (450 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
    *   Fresh mozzarella is used, but any kind is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
    *   It helps make the filling smoother and meltier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
    *   Some individuals set aside some mozzarella for melting over the top, but this method does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Pecorino Romano** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>
    *   7 ounces (200 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
    *   This hard grating cheese provides a stronger flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
    *   It was popular in Southern Italy, where many big, sloppy, red sauce Italian-American dishes originated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
    *   Pecorino is similar to Parmesan but is made with sheep's milk instead of cow's milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
    *   A small portion can be saved for dusting at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. The tiny square remnants from grating can be eaten or added to the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Eggs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>
    *   Four eggs are used, though fewer or none can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
    *   Eggs help the filling set into a more "cakey" texture, preventing it from crumbling and falling off the fork when eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Garlic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>
    *   A couple of cloves are grated as finely as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
    *   Only a small amount is needed as it won't be cooked much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Herbs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>
    *   Fresh parsley and basil are chopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
    *   Thin stems are acceptable, but thick ones should be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
    *   A portion of the herbs can be reserved for garnishing at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
    *   Blanched or thoroughly drained frozen spinach can also be added to the filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Seasoning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>
    *   A large amount of black pepper is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
    *   No additional salt is needed due to the sufficient saltiness of the Pecorino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

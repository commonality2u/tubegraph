From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

This method allows for baking a great pizza in a standard home oven without needing a pizza stone or [[differences_between_pizza_stone_and_steel | pizza steel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Typically, a heavy, thermally conductive slab is necessary to brown the bottom of a pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Without it, pizza can taste like bread with toppings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This [[baking_techniques_for_pizza_at_home | baking technique]] achieves a brown, crispy bottom by cooking the pizza directly on the oven grate itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

While it takes practice and yields a slightly different result from a traditional pie, it is very tasty and quick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. There's no need to preheat the oven on maximum for an hour to heat a stone or steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Oven Preparation

1.  **Activate Broiler**: Turn the [[using_an_oven_broiler_for_pizza | broiler]] (the filament at the top of the oven, often called a grill in the UK) to its hottest setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  **Position Grate**: Ensure the oven grate is reasonably clean and positioned high, preferably the second position from the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
3.  **Preheat Grate**: Broilers heat in seconds, but allow a few minutes for the grate itself to heat up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. A simple test is to place a wet towel on the grate; if it sizzles, it's hot enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The grate should reach temperature while the dough is being prepped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Dough Preparation

1.  **Dough Recipe**: Use your preferred pizza dough recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
2.  **Cold Rise**: After mixing and portioning into balls, place the dough directly into the refrigerator for a cold rise, from at least a day up to a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
3.  **Work Cold Dough**: Work with the dough straight out of the refrigerator; the colder the dough, the better it performs in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
4.  **Flour and Roll**: Lightly flour both sides of the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
5.  **Even Thickness**: Instead of hand-stretching, use a rolling pin (or a wine bottle) to roll the dough out to an even thickness throughout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This method requires uniform thickness for optimal results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Rolling and turning the dough, similar to [[bread_baking_techniques | pastry rolling]], prevents sticking and helps even out the shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
6.  **Shape**: Aim for an oblong or rectangular shape, as it is easier to manage in the oven and under the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Roll it slightly less thin than desired, as it will stretch more during transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
7.  **Oil**: Quickly coat one side of the dough with a very thin film of olive oil while the dough is still cold and stiff. This stiffness makes it easier to drape onto the hot oven grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Baking Process

### First Cook (Bottom Browning)

1.  **Drape Dough**: Pull the oven grate out as far as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Carefully drape the dough onto the hot grate, **oil side down** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
2.  **Even Placement**: If large areas of dough hang too far down, pick them up and stretch them to hang over the nearest grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The goal is to keep every inch of dough as equal a distance as possible from the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
3.  **Broil First Side**: Slide the grate back in and close the oven door for more even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Watch it constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
4.  **Leopard Spotting**: This first stage takes about three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Look for the dough to start burning slightly, resulting in "leopard spotting," which is standard for traditional pizza crusts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
5.  **Uneven Broiler**: If your broiler has hotter spots (e.g., towards the back), the dough might brown unevenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. If extremely uneven, consider rotating the dough, but only after it's cooked enough to release from the grates intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
6.  **Flip and Rotate**: Once the first side is adequately browned, flip the dough over. The oiled, downward-facing side should release easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. You can use fingers or tongs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Rotate it so the browner side is now facing the cooler part of the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Topping the Pizza

1.  **Dress in Oven**: Dress the pizza directly on the grate in the oven for faster cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
2.  **Sauce**: Use a simple sauce like Passata (kitchen-ready ground tomatoes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. If using other crushed tomatoes, add tomato paste for stronger flavor, olive oil, a little sugar, and dried herbs like oregano or basil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Since it's a super-thin pizza, apply less sauce than instinct suggests to avoid sogginess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
3.  **Cheese**: Add finely grated Parmesan on top of the sauce for flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Then, use freshly grated mozzarella (e.g., whole milk low-moisture). Pre-grated cheese contains anti-caking agents that hinder browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Fresh, high-moisture mozzarella can also be used, but in smaller quantities to prevent a soggy pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Second Cook (Topping Browning)

1.  **Broil Toppings**: Slide the pizza back under the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Again, close the oven door for more even results and watch continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
2.  **Rotate (if needed)**: After about two minutes, if the cheese is browning unevenly (e.g., the back row of bubbles looks like it will burn), rotate the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The crust will have solidified, making rotation easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
3.  **Final Browning**: Continue cooking until the cheese is browned to your liking (about another minute) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
4.  **Remove**: Transfer the pizza straight to a cooling rack to maintain crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Results and Advantages

*   **Total Cook Time**: The entire process can take as little as seven minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Flavor and Texture**: Since sauce and cheese cook for only half the time, the sauce retains a brighter color and flavor, and the cheese hardly breaks down, resulting in minimal grease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Crispy Crust**: The crust is very crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Unique Characteristics**: The topside crust gets dry heat, leading to layers that are a bit more distinct in the mouth, and the bottom crust is smooth on the tongue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This makes it taste amazingly close to a New York-style pizza, though slightly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: The oven grates recharge heat quickly, allowing for immediate baking of another pizza after the first one is done, unlike a pizza stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Why This Method Works (and Why Others Don't)

*   **Even Dough Thickness**: [[Baking techniques for perfect crust | Uniform dough thickness]] is crucial because areas that are gossamer-thin will burn rapidly while thicker areas remain pale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Hand-stretching often leads to uneven thickness and thus uneven cooking under the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Baking on a Baking Sheet**: While easier, baking on a baking sheet significantly slows cooking, taking eight minutes to get color on the first side compared to three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The crust becomes dry and hard, resembling a pre-baked crust or a "hot cracker" â€“ good food, but bad pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This method uses direct heat from the broiler and lacks the conductive heat from the grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Baking on a Cooling Rack**: Using a cooling rack allows heat from both sides but still cooks slowly because the dough isn't directly touching the hot grates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. It can lead to a crackery crust that doesn't merge with toppings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Preheating the cooling rack might help, but many cooling racks are not designed to withstand very high broiler temperatures and have coatings that can melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Thinner metal in cooling racks also retains and transfers less heat than thicker oven grates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

When baking directly on hot oven grates, the pizza is literally grilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. It receives radiant heat from above, some radiation/convection from below, and conductive heat from the hot grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This combination leads to quicker cooking and less moisture loss before browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. It also allows for intense heat from above, ensuring great color on the cheese, which is often a challenge with outdoor grilled pizzas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Tips for Success

*   **Experiment**: Every oven is different and will have its own "broiler hot spots" and eccentricities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Practice**: It's recommended to make a batch of four to eight dough balls and practice this method multiple times in your oven before attempting to make dinner for guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Energy Efficient**: Once mastered, this is an easy and energy-efficient [[alternative_methods_of_baking_pizza | method for baking pizza]] that requires no special equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

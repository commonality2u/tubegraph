While various fad diets, including raw and paleo diets, advocate for specific eating habits, [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] has been an integral part of the human diet and [[biological_and_social_impacts_of_cooking | human evolution]] for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Anthropologists refer to this as the [[biological_and_social_impacts_of_cooking | cooking hypothesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The advantages [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] offered ancient humans still apply today, particularly concerning [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | nutrition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Enhanced Energy Extraction and Digestibility

One of the primary [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | nutritional benefits]] of [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] is the ability to extract more energy from food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Dr. Jessica Ham, an anthropology professor, explains that when humans shifted from a fully raw foods diet to one that included cooked meat, they extracted more energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This shift led to physiological changes such as shrinking guts and changes in tooth shape and size, as there was less need to grind raw items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Compared to animals like goats or buffalo, humans have a proportionally much smaller digestive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This is because [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] effectively "pre-digests" food outside the body, breaking it down in the pot so that the human body has less work to do once consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Less body mass and time dedicated to digestion means more energy can be dedicated to other activities, including the expansion of brain capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

[[cooking_techniques | Cooking]] methods like boiling in water, facilitated by the advent of stone basins and pottery, allowed humans to gain more from their food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. For example, a tough piece of wild animal meat that yields little when roasted can easily fall off the bone after a few hours of boiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Furthermore, proteins and other [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | nutrients]] that might be lost in other [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] methods are conveniently dissolved in the broth when boiling, which can then be consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This exemplifies the [[benefits_of_long_cooking_processes | extractive powers of cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Increased Bioavailability of Nutrients

While some claim [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] destroys [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | nutrients]], the losses are generally very small, and the [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | benefits of cooking]] far outweigh any negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Dr. Tim Crowe, a nutrition researcher, states that [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] can actually make some [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | nutrients]] *more* available and food more easily digestible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

It's a case of "swings and roundabouts" where some [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | nutrients]] might be absorbed less, but others are absorbed more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. A notable example is lycopene, a vitamin A pigment found in tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. When tomatoes are cooked, more of this vitamin A antioxidant is absorbed into the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Another example is legumes; it is virtually impossible to digest beans and lentils without [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] them first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Improved Food Safety

Beyond digestibility and [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | nutrient]] availability, [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] significantly enhances food safety by killing off bacteria that cause food poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This is a major cause of illness globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Raw Food Diet Criticisms

Advocates of raw food diets sometimes claim reduced bioavailability helps with weight loss, as fewer calories may be absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. However, this approach of not fully utilizing perfectly good food is considered inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Most of the weight loss observed in raw food diets is attributed to limiting food choices and eliminating processed foods, rather than the raw aspect itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

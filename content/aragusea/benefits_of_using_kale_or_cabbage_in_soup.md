When making [[making_a_great_vegetable_soup | vegetable soup]], incorporating Brassica vegetables like kale or cabbage can enhance both flavor and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:52">[03:21:52]</a>.

## Characteristics and Benefits
Any Brassica can be used, but varieties with crinkly leaves, such as Tuscan kale or savoy cabbage, are particularly effective for soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:01">[03:25:01]</a>. These crinkly leaves deliver more broth per square inch to the mouth, providing a satisfying and juicy texture in the soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:10">[03:28:10]</a>.

## Preparation and Cooking
These vegetables should be chopped into small ribbons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:20">[03:41:20]</a>. While many other soup ingredients can cook for extended periods, Brassicas can become unpleasant if overcooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:37">[03:43:37]</a>. A cooking time of about 10 minutes is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:50">[03:49:50]</a>. It's noted that cabbage may turn slightly brown during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:01">[04:23:01]</a>.

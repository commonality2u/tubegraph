The online communities surrounding cooking and lifting share a fundamental problem: unproductive arguments and flawed thought patterns [00:00:31]. This issue stems from a simple fact: within a reasonable range, "everything basically works" in both domains, leading to the idea that "everyone is basically right" [00:00:53]. The discourse often focuses on [[debates_and_arguments_in_cooking_and_lifting_techniques | minutiae]] that make only tiny differences, overshadowing the core principles that drive significant results [00:04:59].

## The Debate Over Details: Lifting

In the realm of lifting, trivial arguments often arise, such as the proper hand rotation for "side laterals" (a redundant name for an exercise meaning "side side") [00:01:12]. One argument posits internal rotation (pinkies up) is superior [00:01:27], while another advocates for external rotation (thumbs up) [00:01:37].

A study might show that humeral external rotation increases activation of the anterior and medial deltoid [00:02:02]. However, a closer look at the actual data often reveals the difference in muscle activation between external, neutral, and internal rotation is not very significant [00:02:22].

For wider shoulder muscles, the evidence is clear: pick up a heavy object, lift it away from your body repeatedly until you can't, using a weight that causes max-out around 10-12 reps, rest, and repeat [00:02:28]. Your results will depend almost entirely on:
*   How hard you work [00:02:48]
*   How regularly you work [00:02:50]
*   Your genetics [00:02:51]
*   Pharmaceutical enhancement (or lack thereof) [00:02:53]
*   Diet, which is often more important than minor form adjustments [00:03:01]

### Example: Nutrition and Body Composition
[[personal_goals_and_motivations_in_cooking_and_lifting | Diet]] is crucial for achieving physique goals, as dietary protein is the raw material for muscle growth [00:03:17]. Maximizing protein while minimizing other calorie sources that hide muscles beneath body fat is a fundamental principle [00:03:21]. For instance, a cereal made from milk protein with 13 grams of protein, zero sugar, and four net carbs supports these goals, tasting like sweet junk food without being unhealthy [00:03:14].

## The Debate Over Details: Cooking

Similar unproductive arguments occur in [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking]], such as the "classical sear" versus "reverse sear" methods for steak [00:04:28].
*   **Classical Cooking**: Sear the outside first, then bring the interior to temperature [00:04:30].
*   **Reverse Sear**: Bring the interior to temperature first, then sear the outside [00:04:36].

Both methods, when properly done, will yield great results, making the argument unwinnable [00:04:44]. The differences in outcomes are often so small that other tiny, uncontrolled variables could be responsible [00:04:59].

## The Complexity of Outcomes

Outcomes in both the kitchen and the gym are typically the result of numerous factors, and these variables are rarely isolated in real-world scenarios [00:05:08]. For example, professional bodybuilders often use partial range of motion on exercises like the bench press [00:05:26], despite arguments for full range of motion. Their success is attributed to:
*   Being genetic "freaks of nature" [00:05:38]
*   Extensive pharmaceutical enhancement [00:05:40]
*   Professional training as their job [00:05:47]
*   Incredibly hard, consistent training [00:05:51]
*   Precisely formulated meals [00:05:53]

While they may credit specific form adjustments, they don't test these variables in isolation [00:06:18]. Their physiques are built over years, not through controlled experiments changing only one variable [00:06:23].

## The Limitations of Science

For isolating variables, [[role_of_science_and_studies_in_cooking_and_bodybuilding | scientists in laboratories]] are needed to conduct studies [00:06:42]. However, even these studies have significant limits:
*   **Small Sample Sizes**: A shoulder training study, for instance, might involve only 10 competitive bodybuilders [00:06:52].
*   **Proxy Measurements**: Studies often measure muscle activation (EMG) rather than actual muscle growth or strength improvement [00:07:05]. The correlation between EMG readings and muscle building is an ongoing scientific debate [00:07:20].

Experiments are easier in the kitchen, as "things" can be destroyed for findings, unlike people [00:07:26]. Cooking also has a faster feedback loop (a steak cooks in minutes versus years for a physique) [00:07:42]. Yet, even in cooking, isolating variables is hard due to differences in cuts of meat, heat control, or even the tester's hunger level [00:07:48].

While food science exists, it primarily focuses on industrial food manufacturing and food safety due to financial incentives [00:08:30]. Similarly, the scientific establishment has limited investment in cosmetic bodybuilding compared to public health issues like cancer or heart disease [00:08:54]. This lack of extensive research means professional bodybuilders often rely on "bro science" to fill knowledge gaps, a phenomenon also present in cooking [00:09:49].

## The Obsession with Minutiae

The highly repetitive nature of both cooking and lifting contributes to an obsession with minor details [00:10:17]. When performing a routine task, like cutting garlic for the millionth time [00:10:24] or repeating a lift [00:11:01], the mind has ample space to consider minutiae like optimal knife angle, root snipping, or crushing for flavor [00:10:31]. These variables likely make a tiny difference but are considered because the mental capacity is available [00:10:48].

This obsession is exacerbated by the content marketplace [00:12:03]. Content creators need things to talk about, even if it means refuting "stupid videos" that focus on inconsequential methods [00:12:46]. Many videos test slightly different ways to make something, only to conclude that "they all basically taste the same," advising to choose the easier method [00:13:06].

## The Positive Outcome: Asking Fundamental Questions

Despite the unproductive debates, both lifting and [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking discourse]] force individuals to ask fundamental questions about "why we do what we do" and "what is the purpose" [00:13:33].

### The "Why" of Lifting: Goals and Real-World Function
Consider the deadlift [00:13:43]. It uses major muscles, but grip strength can be a limiting factor, leading some to use straps [00:14:02]. This prompts a fundamental question: What is the goal?
*   To move the most weight [00:14:16]?
*   To grow specific muscles [00:14:19]?
*   To be able to pick up heavy things in the real world [00:14:24]?

In real-world situations, grip assists are unlikely to be available, suggesting that strengthening the weakest link (grip) is more practical [00:14:31].

A personal story highlights this: The speaker found that lifting heavy enough to cause delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), especially after lower body workouts, made it agony to get down and up from the floor to play with his infant [00:16:09]. This led to a profound realization: "What is the point of all of this? What am I trying to be fit for? What am I gonna do in my life that's more important than what I'm doing right now?" [00:16:59]. This experience shifted [[personal_goals_and_motivations_in_cooking_and_lifting | personal goals and motivations in cooking and lifting | his lifting priorities]] from absolute strength to functional fitness that allowed him to engage with his life, leading him to back off heavy weights and prioritize being able to function [00:17:29].

### The "Why" of Cooking: The End Product vs. The Process
Similarly, the kitchen presents a fundamental value question: "Am I trying to have something good to eat or am I trying to make something good to eat?" [00:17:49].
*   **Having something good to eat**: If the goal is the end product, then using prepared ingredients or thickening sauces with starch (as seen in [[cultural_identity_and_dietary_distinctions | Chinese American food]], which was once seen as "cheating" compared to reduction in European cooking) is acceptable, as long as it achieves the desired outcome [00:17:58].
*   **Making something good to eat**: If the journey and the act of cooking provide pleasure, then the process itself is the goal [00:18:11].

These activities force us to consider these essential questions. Assuming a basic level of competency, it is far more valuable to obsess over *why* we do what we do, rather than *how* we do it [00:18:27].

Panko, a type of breadcrumb originating from Japan, possesses unique qualities that make it a superior choice for various culinary applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its distinct characteristics, stemming from its peculiar manufacturing process, contribute to its exceptional performance in cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Unparalleled Crispiness

One of panko's most notable advantages is its ability to produce a significantly crispier result compared to traditional breadcrumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This holds true even when panko is ground into a fine powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, as demonstrated by a comparison between panko-powdered schnitzel and normal breadcrumb schnitzel, with the panko version being "way crispier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

This superior crispiness is attributed to panko's unique microstructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Unlike typical breadcrumbs, which are simply staled, dried, or toasted bread ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, panko bread is baked using electrical current, cooking it from the inside out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This process results in an "extremely light airy crumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> that is "super crispy when dry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Crispiness is defined as being both brittle and airy, characterized by "thin sheets of brittle material interspersed with little voids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Optimized for Frying

Panko's airy microstructure also makes it highly absorbent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. While it absorbs a significant amount of oil during frying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, this absorption plays a crucial role in heat transmission to the food, which helps cook it and evaporate water from the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Crucially, when removed from the fryer, the oil drains out of the panko crumb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This prevents the fried food from becoming greasy, heavy, or soggy, allowing it to stay crispier for a longer duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The "wide open hollows in the panko" are believed to facilitate this oil drainage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Versatile as a Binder

Beyond frying, panko's absorbency makes it an excellent binder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Chefs frequently use panko in mixtures such as meatballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Its high absorbency allows for a mixture to be bound and made moldable while adding less bread to the overall product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Neutral Flavor and Uniform Color

The unique electrical baking process means that the bread for panko develops no crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This results in a product with a totally uniform color and a more neutral flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It acts as a "blank canvas to the cook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, allowing the flavors of the main ingredients to shine through.

## Traditional Sliver Shape

Traditional panko often comes in long, jagged slivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This specific crumb shape is crucial for achieving the desired texture in dishes like Japanese style breaded shrimp or [[chicken_katsu|chicken katsu]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The sliver shape is a result of the baking and fermentation processes, which allow the gluten fibers to naturally lengthen, leading to a flakey texture when ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Foolproof Crispiness

Despite potential challenges in frying, such as low oil temperature which can lead to more oil absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, panko consistently delivers crispy results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Its inherent qualities make it "foolproof crispy every time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Example: [[chicken_katsu|Chicken Katsu]] Preparation

A typical application showcasing panko's advantages is the preparation of [[chicken_katsu|chicken katsu]], a Japanese chicken schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
1.  **Meat Preparation**: Chicken thighs are preferred over breast meat, pounded thin, and aggressively seasoned with [[benefits_of_kosher_salt_in_cooking|salt]] and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Seasoning the meat directly provides a visual guide and accounts for subsequent marinades or breadings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
2.  **Marination**: The chicken is marinated in mirin (Japanese white wine) in a shallow vessel to ensure full submersion with minimal liquid, reducing waste and diluting seasoning less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
3.  **Breading**: After at least an hour of marination, the chicken is dried, dredged in flour, then beaten egg, and finally coated in panko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
4.  **Frying**: The chicken is shallow-fried in neutral oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. A gentle heat is maintained, especially for thigh meat, to ensure it cooks through without burning the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
5.  **Serving**: Traditionally served with a Japanese brown sauce called tonkatsu, which can be simulated with ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire, sugar, honey, and ginger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Even if the dish is not perfectly executed or sits for a while, panko ensures it remains crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

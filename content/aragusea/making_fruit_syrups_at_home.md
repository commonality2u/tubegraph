Snow cones, shaved ice, slushies, raspa, kagegori, and patbingsu are all variations of pulverized ice flavored with syrup, which are easy and fun summertime desserts to make at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This can be done without buying a dedicated ice shaving machine, using gear already at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Preparing Fruit for Syrup

1.  **Select Fruit**: Choose strongly flavored fruits like berries or citrus, such as cherries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
2.  **Initial Cook**: Place fruit in a pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. There's no need to pit or peel anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Add a little water, at most enough to cover, to prevent the fruit from burning on the hot pan surface before it releases its own water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
3.  **Boil**: Boil the fruit on high heat until it starts to fall apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Delicate berries might take a couple of minutes, while more robust fruits like cherries can take 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
4.  **Mash**: Help the process along by taking a masher and crushing the fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If the pan starts looking too dry or thick, add a little more water to prevent sticking and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
5.  **Don't Overcook**: Cook the fruit until it is soft enough to easily press all the juice out, but avoid cooking for too long as it can dull the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
6.  **Strain**: Pull the pot off the heat once the fruit is soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Place a fine sieve over a bowl and pour everything into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This eliminates the need for pitting or peeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Use a stiff spoon to grind the solids into the sieve to extract more juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Finishing the Syrup

1.  **Combine with Sugar**: Rinse out the pot to remove any chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, then pour the strained juice back in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
2.  **Add Sugar**: The quantity of sugar depends on the sweetness of the fruit and how much water was boiled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. A roughly equal quantity of sugar is likely the maximum desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It's best to be conservative, as you can always taste and adjust later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
3.  **Boil for Concentration**: Bring the mixture to a boil on high heat to dissolve the sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Enough water has evaporated and the sugar concentration is right when the bubbles start to stack on top of each other, indicating a light syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Pull it off the heat before it bubbles over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
4.  **Adjust Flavor**: Once cooled, taste the syrup cautiously, remembering that [[risks_associated_with_hot_sugar_syrups_in_cooking | syrup can reach much higher temperatures than water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Since the syrup will flavor bland water ice, it should taste overly sweet and tart on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Adjust acidity with ingredients like lime juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
5.  [[storing_and_using_homemade_syrups | Storage and Cooling]]: Store the syrup in mason jars or other covered containers in the refrigerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. To cool quickly, place the container in a bowl of ice water and stir occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Colder syrup flows slower and spreads more evenly through ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Preparing Shaved Ice

### Food Processor Method

*   Dump ice cubes into a food processor and pulse a few times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   Large chunks may spin around and not hit the blades; these can be discarded or pulsed further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Be aware that the ice will eventually start melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   This method yields chunks like tiny pebbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Blender Method

*   Blenders are often more narrow with smaller blades and may have ice crushing settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   The automatic pulsing creates a finer consistency, almost like natural snow, without giant chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This is a preferred method for consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Manual Shaving Method (for wider flakes)

*   Freeze a pan of water (wider is better) for a few hours until solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Use a large steel chisel, washed thoroughly to remove non-food oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Lightly scrape across the ice surface; avoid pushing too hard to prevent large chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   This method works even better as the ice starts to melt, with water acting as a lubricant on the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. It produces wide, delicate flakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Serving Shaved Ice

*   Pour in syrup so it looks like not quite enough at first; it will slowly spread through the ice as you eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The dessert offers a refreshing taste that is better than overly sweet store-bought options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## [[different_fruit_flavors_for_shaved_ice | Other Fruit Flavor Ideas for Syrups]]

*   **Kumquats**: Delicious, complex, and tart citrus fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. No need to peel or seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Their robust skin needs mashing to release juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Cutting them in half before cooking would also help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Strawberries with Rhubarb**: Strawberries are a classic choice and cook soft very fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Rhubarb, which looks like celery but tastes like bitter citrus, is a classic complement to strawberries in dessert, adding sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This mixture turns to mush in about five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Balsamic vinegar can be used to add more acid to strawberry syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Blueberries with Lemongrass**: Blueberries cook real fast and have intense pigment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Lemongrass is a fantastic complement to blueberry syrup; chop it up and add it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Blueberry skins are surprisingly tough and benefit from mashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Blueberry syrup often needs lime juice for acidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Pomegranate**: While typically difficult to eat due to seeds and structural matter, pomegranate can be easily used for syrup since all solids, including white mesocarp and seeds, are strained out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Pomegranates also benefit from mashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Keep the syrup topped off with water during cooking to prevent it from getting too thick and concentrated, which could cause it to stick and burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Artificial coloring can be added if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Other Uses for Homemade Syrups

Once made, these syrups are versatile:
*   Mix with an equal quantity of club soda for a refreshing drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   Easily convert into a grown-up beverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   Drizzle on pancakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   Dilute with a bit of water and freeze as popsicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Alternatives to Fruit Syrups

*   **Sweetened Condensed Milk**: An easy alternative is to use sweetened condensed milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Some people pour this on water ice, while others use ice made of milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Korean Shaved Ice**: The Korean way involves adding many different garnishes to the cup, allowing for combinations of flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

Desserts like shaved ice are arguably better suited to the home kitchen than [[homemade_ice_cream_making_techniques | ice cream]] or [[incorporating_fruits_and_other_mixins_into_homemade_ice_cream | ice cream with mixins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

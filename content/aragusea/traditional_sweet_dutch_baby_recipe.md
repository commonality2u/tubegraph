A Dutch baby is a type of popover, similar to a Yorkshire pudding, but baked in a wide pan [00:00:02]. The origin of its name is disputed, though "Dutch" is likely an anglicization of "Deutsche," suggesting a German origin [00:07:00]. It is essentially a very wet, unleavened pancake batter that steams significantly in the oven, causing it to puff up and "pop over" the rim of the pan [00:00:18].

## Ingredients and Proportions for a Sweet Dutch Baby

For a traditional sweet Dutch baby, the batter typically calls for two eggs [00:00:40]. The standard ratio is:
*   **Milk:** One-third of a cup (80 ml) per egg, so two-thirds of a cup for a two-egg recipe [00:00:38].
*   **Flour:** One-third of a cup (40 grams) per egg [00:01:16].
*   **Salt:** A big pinch of salt per egg, or about a quarter teaspoon per egg [00:00:58].
*   **Sugar:** Approximately a teaspoon of sugar per egg [00:01:03]. This small amount is not enough to make it a dessert, but rather helps the taste "come alive" [00:04:36].
*   **Vanilla:** A "glug" of vanilla is added purely for the sweet recipe [00:01:10].
*   **Starch:** Up to half of the flour can be replaced with cornstarch or any other starch to achieve a more tender final product, though it might make it slightly less "poofy" [00:01:23].

To maximize the puff, it's beneficial for the batter to be warm before entering the oven [00:00:25].
*   **Warm Ingredients:** Refrigerated eggs can be warmed for about a minute in hot tap water [00:00:30]. Cold milk can be warmed in the microwave for approximately 30 seconds; it should not be so hot that it prematurely cooks the eggs [00:00:35].
*   **Mixing:** The batter requires thorough mixing, often done in a blender for smoothness and a bigger rise [00:01:45].
    *   Crack eggs into a bowl and add salt and sugar [00:00:54]. Add vanilla for the sweet version [00:01:10].
    *   Beat until the eggs are very loose and frothy [00:01:11].
    *   Whisk in the flour and starch (if using) before adding milk, as the thicker mixture is easier to whisk free of lumps [00:01:35].
    *   Gradually whisk in the warm milk until the batter is very well mixed [00:01:42].
*   **Resting:** Like crepe batter, the Dutch baby batter should sit for at least 20 minutes to allow particles to hydrate, proteins to auto-lyse, and the batter to become more elastic and able to puff up like a balloon [00:01:51]. Some people even let the batter sit overnight [00:05:18].

## Baking the Dutch Baby

*   **Oven and Pan Temperature:** Place your pan into the oven and preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) [00:02:02]. Heating the pan with the oven is more efficient than on the stove [00:02:08]. The pan should be extremely hot, capable of melting butter enthusiastically [00:02:12].
*   **Butter and Batter:** Traditionally, Dutch babies are made in [[quality_cookware_recommendations_for_making_dutch_babies | cast iron]], but less butter can be used in a non-stick pan [00:02:16]. Melt a good layer of butter in the hot pan [00:02:25]. Pour the batter in quickly before the butter burns [00:02:20]. The batter should look watery, as water creates steam [00:02:25]. A 10-inch (25 cm) pan can accommodate a three-egg or even four-egg popover, but a thinner product is often preferred [00:02:28].
*   **Baking Time:** Close the oven door and avoid opening it until the Dutch baby is puffy and golden brown, which typically takes about 20 minutes [00:02:36]. Maintaining heat and steam within the oven is crucial to prevent collapse [00:02:42].
*   **Deflation:** The Dutch baby will deflate once removed from the oven as the steam subsides [00:02:46]. This is when many choose to photograph it for social media [00:02:53].
*   **Post-Baking:** If using a non-stick pan, the Dutch baby should lift out easily [00:02:59]. It's suggested to transfer it to a cooling rack to prevent the bottom from becoming soggy [00:03:55]. If using [[quality_cookware_recommendations_for_making_dutch_babies | cast iron]], melting extra butter on the bottom can help with removal [00:03:38].

## Serving the Sweet Dutch Baby

A traditional way to top a sweet Dutch baby is with a squeeze of lemon juice and a generous amount of sugar [00:03:59]. It can be torn to eat or cut into wedges [00:04:05]. People often top them with various ingredients like whipped cream, fruit (such as cherries), or anything desired [00:04:09].

The sweet Dutch baby is described as crispy on the outside and somewhat custardy on the inside, with a thicker product resulting in a more custardy interior [00:04:14].

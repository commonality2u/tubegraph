This guide provides practical approaches to cooking various basic egg dishes, aiming to cover fundamental techniques for pan-cooked eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## General Egg Cooking Principles

*   **Pan Choice**: A non-stick pan is highly recommended for cooking eggs, significantly simplifying the process compared to other types of pans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. While non-stick pans can be used without fat, most people prefer to use some for better flavor and to prevent sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. For more information on pan selection, see [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | Choosing the right pan and using nonstick pans for cooking eggs]].
*   **Fat**: Butter is often preferred over oil for its flavor and because it provides sensory clues about pan temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Temperature Clues using Butter**:
        *   Melting smoothly: Pan is not hot enough for most egg cooking styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
        *   Foaming gently: Ideal starting temperature for most eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.
        *   Browning: Pan is quite hot, suitable for some specific preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
    *   A gentle foaming indicates a good starting heat, typically just below medium on a stove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. For more on controlling heat, see [[cooking_techniques_for_perfect_eggs_controlling_heat_using_butter_or_oil | Cooking techniques for perfect eggs controlling heat using butter or oil]].
*   **Egg Temperature**: Eggs can be cooked straight from the refrigerator or at room temperature, with little difference in the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Cracking Eggs**: Crack eggs on a flat surface to avoid sending shell shards into the egg and to prevent breaking the yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Egg Freshness**: A fresh egg will have a viscous white that holds a tidy shape in the pan, forming a plateau around the yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Older eggs will have a more liquid white that spreads out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## Sunny Side Up Eggs

Sunny side up eggs are cooked primarily on one side, leaving the yolk runny and exposed.

*   **Basic Sunny Side Up**:
    *   Cook until the bottom white is well-cooked with a slightly golden edge and firm enough to slide around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
    *   The inner ring of white may still be gooey, and the yolk raw or cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
    *   This method can result in a very firm white that is difficult to cut with a fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Steamed Sunny Side Up (Covered)**:
    *   After cracking the egg into gently foaming butter, a pinch of salt can be added while the top is still liquid for even seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
    *   Place a tight-fitting lid (or foil as a substitute) over the pan to trap steam, which cooks the top of the egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
    *   After a few minutes, the yolk will appear cloudy and be warm but still soft and runny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
    *   This results in a more evenly cooked egg, though the bottom may still be brown and hard to cut with a fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   **Soft and Creamy Sunny Side Up**:
    *   Requires very low heat, where the butter hardly foams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
    *   The bottom white sets without bubbling or fluttering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
    *   Cover the pan to steam the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
    *   This process takes longer (around 8 minutes) but yields a soft, custardy white that is easily cut with a fork, and a warm, runny yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

## Crispy Eggs

For a crispy egg, higher heat and oil are generally preferred.

*   Use oil, as milk solids in butter would likely burn at the high temperatures required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   Cook on medium-high heat, aiming for the white to flutter and bubble vigorously, producing lots of steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   Be cautious, as hot oil may spit; keep children away from the stove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   The high heat causes the yolk to become cloudy even without covering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   The bottom white becomes firm and crispy, like a potato chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
*   Use a spatula to lift the egg, leaving excess oil behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

## Basted Eggs

A basted egg involves cooking with extra oil or fat and spooning it over the yolk to cook the top.

*   Use more oil than usual; extra virgin olive oil or even chicken fat can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.
*   Cook the egg to achieve a soft white bottom, without fluttering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
*   Instead of covering, tilt the pan to pool the hot oil and spoon it over the top of the egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.
*   This method offers more control, allowing specific areas of the egg to be cooked more precisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
*   The yolk remains brighter and less cloudy compared to steaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
*   The egg needs to be lifted out of the oil with a spatula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
*   The same basting technique can be used at higher temperatures for a bubbly, fried effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

## Over Easy Eggs

Over easy eggs are a popular method where the egg is flipped to cook both sides, resulting in a runny yolk.

*   Start with gently foaming butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.
*   Cook the white until it's fairly solid (around 2.5 minutes) and the inner ring of white just begins to set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.
*   To flip without breaking the yolk, slide the egg to the edge of the pan so it's already on its side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Avoid flipping too high, as the yolk may break on impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   For a runny yolk, cook for only about 30 seconds on the second side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   The egg can be slid directly onto the plate or flipped back again if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   Once the egg is solid enough after the first flip, a spatula can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.
*   Like scrambled eggs, over easy eggs are time-sensitive due to being cooked from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>; they often need to be removed from the pan moments before they appear perfectly done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

## Scrambled Eggs

[[american_versus_french_style_scrambled_eggs_and_omelettes | American style scrambled eggs]] are characterized by fluffy curds.

*   **Preparation**: Crack eggs into a bowl and add a tiny pinch of salt per egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. A splash of milk or water can be added to loosen the mixture, allowing the egg to expand and fluff up with steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.
*   **Cooking**: Use more fat in the pan and slightly higher heat, aiming for a "not-so-gentle" foam of butter to create steam for fluffy curds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.
*   Start by stirring constantly, similar to an omelet, until the egg begins to set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. Then, scrape the egg off the bottom to form big, fluffy ribbons or sheets of curd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.
*   Scrambled eggs are very time-sensitive because they receive intense heat from all sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. To keep them runny on the inside, they need to be removed from the pan just before they appear fully cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

## Omelette

This section focuses on [[american_versus_french_style_scrambled_eggs_and_omelettes | American style diner omelettes]].

*   **Pan Size and Eggs**: For a 10-inch pan, a minimum of three eggs is recommended to prevent the omelet from being too thin and tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.
*   **Preparation**: Add a little salt and milk to the eggs and beat them very smooth to loosen the protein structure, allowing the eggs to flow readily into a thin sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
*   **Cooking**:
    *   Use lots of butter, even in a non-stick pan, and ensure butter coats the sides where the egg will go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.
    *   For an [[american_versus_french_style_scrambled_eggs_and_omelettes | American diner omelette]], use aggressive heat (butter with aggressive foam), unlike a [[american_versus_french_style_scrambled_eggs_and_omelettes | fancy French omelet]] which uses a much lower temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.
    *   Stir constantly and wipe down the sides as long as the mixture remains liquid; this promotes rapid and even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.
    *   Once it stops flowing, push it down into an even, plastic-like layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.
    *   **Fillings**: Add fillings like fresh herbs or cheese at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.
*   **Folding**: Turn off the heat and fold the omelet before the top is completely set; it should still be a little gooey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. The traditional tri-fold shape offers multiple chances to get the fold right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.
*   Like other eggs cooked from all sides, omelets are time-sensitive and need to be removed from the pan just before they reach your desired doneness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.

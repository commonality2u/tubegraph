Making stuffed crust pizza can be a rewarding experience, but there are several challenges that can lead to issues like leaks or an improperly sealed crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, with careful preparation and specific techniques, these problems can be overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Dough Preparation and Handling

The dough plays a crucial role in the success of a stuffed crust pizza.

### Dough Consistency
One common issue is the dough tearing and leaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. To counter this, it's beneficial to knead in a little extra flour than usual, aiming for a dough that is sticky, but only slightly so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A drier dough will be stronger and less prone to tearing and leakage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Dough Quantity
Stuffed crust pizza requires more dough per pizza than a standard one to adequately wrap the cheese ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Where one might typically divide dough into four pizzas, three is a more appropriate number for stuffed crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Avoiding Surface Oil
When rising the dough, avoid using olive oil in the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Oil on the surface of the dough ball can make it harder to achieve a good seal around the cheese later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Cold Dough for Handling
After a [[aging_pizza_dough | cold rise in the fridge]], the dough is easier to work with when it's cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. If the dough isn't cold, it's more likely to tear during handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Shaping and Sealing the Crust

Properly shaping and sealing the dough around the cheese is critical to prevent leaks.

### Rolling Out the Dough
Instead of dusting with flour, roll the dough out directly on the counter, allowing it to stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This sticking prevents the dough from snapping back like a rubber band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Roll it evenly round and slightly wider than your pizza screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Hand stretching is not recommended for stuffed crust, as it won't make the outer ring thin enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Ensuring Sufficient Excess Dough
A significant amount of very thin excess dough around the edge is required to fold over and seal the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Roll out the "skirts" hanging over the edge, again allowing them to stick to the counter to keep them stretched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. It's crucial to have a lot of excess all the way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If there's a short bit, you can tear excess from elsewhere and graft it on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Sealing the Cheese Ring
After positioning the string cheese, wet the dough with water before folding and crimping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **Preventing Interior Leaks**: If there isn't enough excess dough folded back onto the interior of the pizza, the cheese ring is highly likely to leak into the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Preventing Outer/Bottom Leaks**: Ample excess dough also means you don't have to stretch the dough too tightly over the cheese, which could cause it to tear and leak through the outer side or bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Once the crust is formed and brushed with an herb butter mixture, press hard to seal the cheese ring, as greasy fingertips won't stick to the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Cheese Selection and Preparation

### String Cheese Thickness
For a home oven-sized pizza, full-thickness string cheese pieces can be too thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Cutting them in half is recommended, though some may prefer to leave them whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Chilling the cheese after cutting is also advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Cheese for Topping
The video also highlights the use of string cheese for the pizza topping itself, specifically the whole milk low moisture version of the brand used for the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This string cheese is preferred over block versions due to its dryer and sharper qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Preventing Overcooked Cheese
In home ovens that don't get hot enough, cheese can overheat and release excessive orange grease before the crust browns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. To slow the melting process of the cheese, consider chilling it and cutting it into large chunks or "pellets" before topping the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Baking Challenges in a Home Oven

Home ovens often pose [[challenges_of_achieving_professional_pizza_crust_in_a_home_oven | challenges to achieving professional pizza crust]], especially for stuffed crust.

### Sticking to the Peel
Preparing a stuffed crust pizza takes time, and if it sits on a wooden or metal peel, it will likely stick by the time you try to slide it into the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Baking Surface
To avoid sticking, it's highly recommended to bake stuffed crust pizza on a pizza screen or directly on parchment paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. A 14-inch diameter screen is a good maximum size for a home oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Achieving a Crispy Bottom
For the bottom crust to brown properly, a baking steel or stone is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Uneven Heating
Some home ovens may not get hot enough or distribute heat evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. It may be necessary to switch to the broiler (top element) halfway through baking to ensure proper browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Stuffed Crust Unique Qualities
Unlike commercial stuffed crust pizzas that use special cheese blends designed to hold their shape, homemade versions with string cheese will flatten and create a hollow dome above the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, this is not a negative, as the cavity can create a croissant-like texture when bitten into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Baking on a screen also gives the bottom a golden finish, reminiscent of airport pizza, which can be a desirable aesthetic for stuffed crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

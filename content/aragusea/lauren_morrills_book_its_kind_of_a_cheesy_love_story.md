The book was released and available in bookstores everywhere on the day of the video's publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, with links available for purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Inspiration and Plot
The idea for the book originated from a viral story about a woman who gave birth in a Chick-fil-A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. In Morrill's novel, the protagonist is born on the bathroom floor of a locally owned pizza parlor named Hot and Crusty Pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. As a result of her unique birth, she is granted free pizza for life and a guaranteed job at the parlor when she turns 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The story opens on her 16th birthday, as she is about to begin this job, which she strongly wishes to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Lauren Morrill began writing the book in the fall of 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

A recurring joke within the book is the mysterious appearance of [[string_cheese_usage_in_stuffed_crust | stuffed crust pizza]] in the Hot and Crusty Pizza restaurant at the end of every shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Since Hot and Crusty doesn't make [[string_cheese_usage_in_stuffed_crust | stuffed crust pizza]], the characters are constantly trying to figure out who is bringing pizza from another establishment into their parlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

[[pizza_dough_preparation | Pizza dough preparation]] has evolved to create New York-style pizza in a home kitchen. While stand mixers are often used, a large bowl with a wide base is sufficient to achieve excellent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Ingredients and Initial Mixing

The process begins by combining liquids and activators:
*   **Water** Approximately two and a half cups of warm water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Sugar** A tablespoon of sugar is added. While some might consider this a lot, it primarily assists the crust in browning effectively at the lower temperatures of a home oven, rather than making the dough sweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Yeast** A teaspoon of active dry yeast is mixed in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Let this mixture sit for five minutes to allow the yeast to rehydrate and become active. This "blooming" step is primarily for verifying yeast viability; the dough will rise even if this step is skipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Olive Oil** About two tablespoons of olive oil are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Like sugar, oil helps the crust brown in a home oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Salt** A tablespoon of salt is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Contrary to popular belief, this amount of salt will not kill the yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Flour Selection
Bread flour, with its higher protein content, is recommended for a chewier and stretchier dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. While all-purpose flour can be used, it may result in a less chewy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Begin with five cups of flour by volume, adding more as needed during kneading until the desired consistency is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Kneading and Dough Consistency
After initially bringing the ingredients together with a spatula, knead the dough by hand within the bowl to contain mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Push down with the weight of your body behind your palm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Sprinkle on small amounts of flour as needed to prevent excessive stickiness, but aim for a wetter dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Wetter doughs bake up lighter and crispier, though they are stickier and harder to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Knead for about 10 minutes until a patch of dough can be stretched thin without tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The timing of adding oil (beginning vs. after flour hydration) does not significantly affect the final texture for a lean dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Portioning and Cold Storage

This recipe yields enough dough for four home-oven-sized pizzas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
1.  **Prepare Containers** Pour a little olive oil into four containers, each large enough for a dough ball to double in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
2.  **Divide Dough** Divide the dough into four equal portions, either by weighing or by tearing the ball in half and then halving those pieces, adjusting by feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
3.  **Shape and Oil** Shape each portion into a reasonably smooth and round ball. Use the dough ball itself to spread the oil around the inside of the container, ensuring the ball is thoroughly coated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This oil coating prevents drying out and helps the crust brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
4.  **Cold Rise** Cover the containers and place them directly into the refrigerator for a cold rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This method simplifies the process and allows for future baking on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The dough requires at least 24 hours of cold rise to be ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The dough generally improves as it [[aging_pizza_dough | ages in the fridge]] for up to a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Oven and Steel Preparation
A hot cooking surface is crucial. A pizza steel is preferred over a stone for its superior thermal conductivity, which is ideal for home ovens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Position the steel on the second-highest rack for optimal top browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Preheat the oven to its highest setting (e.g., 550Â°F on convection roast) and preheat the steel for a full hour to achieve a noticeably browner, crispier crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Dough Handling
*   **Cold Dough** Pull the dough straight from the fridge; do not warm it up. The cold temperature helps keep the very wet dough workable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Flour Coating** Lightly coat the dough in flour to prevent sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Stretching** Instead of tossing, use the gravity stretch method. Go around the edge to form a thick crust while letting the rest of the dough stretch naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This provides more control and typically results in an oblong shape, characteristic of New York-style pizza that allows for foldable slices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Aim for the thinnest possible crust that can be baked in a home oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

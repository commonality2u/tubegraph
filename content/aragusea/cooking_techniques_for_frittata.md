The frittata is described as a perfect egg dish due to its versatility, quick preparation, affordability, and the minimal [[cooking techniques | skill]] required to make it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Equipment and Heat Control
A 10-inch nonstick skillet is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Olive oil is added to the skillet and heated on medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Ingredient Preparation
Anything can go into a frittata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. A general formula for a frittata includes:
*   Some kind of onion (e.g., shallots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Some kind of cured pork product (e.g., prosciutto) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
*   Some kind of green vegetable (e.g., steamed broccoli) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Some kind of fresh herb (e.g., dill) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

### Order of Adding Ingredients
1.  **Shallots**: Sliced thin and cooked first to caramelize and sweeten, resembling a Spanish omelet flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  **Thin Meat**: Three slices of prosciutto (or bacon, pancetta, salami) are rolled up and thinly sliced, then cooked to get crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It's important that solid ingredients are basically cooked before eggs are poured in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
3.  **Leftovers**: Cooked leftovers like steamed broccoli, chopped into small bits, are added right before the eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
4.  **Fresh Herbs**: Herbs like dill should be added right before the eggs to prevent overcooking and browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Egg Mixture Preparation
*   Use two or three eggs per person; six eggs total were used in the example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   Add a glug of milk or cream for a softer texture, though some believe it can make eggs slimy if overcooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   Lightly beat with a whisk or fork, preferring streaks of yolk and white for a non-homogenous texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   Season with pepper, but note that salt from cured meats (e.g., prosciutto) and cheese may be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Grate in about an ounce or two of cheese (e.g., smoked gouda), adding half to the eggs and saving the rest for sprinkling on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Proportioning Ingredients
It's suggested that the egg mixture and solid ingredient mixture be roughly equal in volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Cooking the Frittata
1.  **Preheat Broiler**: Turn on the oven's broiler (grill in British English) to a low setting just before pouring in the eggs, being conservative with broiler heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
2.  **Combine and Pour Eggs**: Once prosciutto is crispy and shallots are caramelized, add broccoli and dill to the pan, mix, and then pour in the egg mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
3.  **Even Distribution**: Stir with a silicone spatula to evenly distribute ingredients and help the eggs cook faster and more evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Scrape down the sides of the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
4.  **Final Cheese Topping**: Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top; it will brown nicely under the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
5.  **Broiling**: Place the frittata under the broiler for the entire cooking process to achieve a nice brown top, adjusting the broiler from low to high as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Determining Doneness
*   The frittata is done when the eggs look solid and don't slosh when the pan is shaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   The top will visibly puff up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   Touch it; it should be soft but bouncy. If it's still liquid, it will feel squishy like a water balloon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Serving and Storage
*   Let the frittata cool and solidify for a few minutes before removing from the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   To check if it's stuck, gently shake the pan back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. With a nonstick pan, it can often be shimmy-shaken out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   Alternatively, turn it out onto a plate, then place another plate or board on top and flip it again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   Allow it to rest and become lukewarm, similar to a pizza, before cutting into wedges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   A side salad can provide a good flavor and texture contrast, but the frittata is also a complete meal on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Egg Dishes
The frittata is considered easily as good as, and requires basically no [[different_egg_cooking_styles_sunny_side_up_crispy_basted_over_easy_scrambled_omelette | technique]] compared to, French-style [[different_egg_cooking_styles_sunny_side_up_crispy_basted_over_easy_scrambled_omelette | omelettes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. It is also significantly easier to make than a [[different_egg_cooking_styles_sunny_side_up_crispy_basted_over_easy_scrambled_omelette | Spanish omelette]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

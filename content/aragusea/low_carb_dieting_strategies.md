From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

This article outlines personal strategies for body composition changes, emphasizing a low-carb approach for planned meals to allow for flexibility in overall diet. The author is not a medical or nutritional professional and recommends consulting one before making significant changes to your body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## The Low-Carb Philosophy

The core philosophy revolves around consuming virtually zero carbohydrates in planned meals to balance out inevitable carb intake from social situations or occasional treats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:33">[02:47:33]</a>. This approach aims for a moderate overall carbohydrate intake once "real life gets mixed in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:16">[03:15:16]</a>. Cutting carbohydrates in half combined with exercise has been effective for weight loss for the author <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:49">[03:21:49]</a>.

I don't want to be that guy who's like, oh no, I can't have that, I'm on my diet. I'm gonna sneak some chocolate every now and then, it's going to happen. I'm still gonna have a couple of beers every now and then, that's going to happen. Carbs gonna happen." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:09">[02:50:09]</a>

## Meal Prep: Protein (Tilapia)

For muscle growth to support an exercise regimen, which generally involves [[strength_training_versus_cardio_for_weight_loss | strength training]], protein is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. Tilapia is chosen for its affordability, low mercury content, and relative sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.

### Sustainability Check

For bodybuilding-style meal prep, where large quantities of the same food are consumed for weeks, sustainability is a key consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:35">[01:27:35]</a>. SeafoodWatch.org, a service of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, is recommended for checking fish sustainability based on origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>. The author notes that tilapia farmed in Mexico gets a middle-grade for sustainability, and recommends seeking out sources from Ecuador or Peru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:04">[01:57:04]</a>.

### Cooking Tilapia

*   Almost all seafood is bought frozen solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:35">[02:05:35]</a>. Modern flash-freezing causes virtually no quality degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:50">[02:13:50]</a>.
*   **Method**: The fish is cooked from frozen. A little olive oil, salt, and pepper are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. It is then thrown into an oven at 350°F (180°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:40">[02:23:40]</a>.
*   **Doneness**: The fish is done when it is opaque and flakes easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:47">[04:09:47]</a>.
*   **Result**: The results taste "surprisingly good," which led the author to experiment with [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] frozen solid meat in other recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:03">[02:27:03]</a>.

## Meal Prep: Carbohydrate Alternative ([[cauliflower_rice_as_a_carbohydrate_alternative | Cauliflower Rice]])

Instead of traditional carbohydrates like rice, [[cauliflower_rice_as_a_carbohydrate_alternative | cauliflower rice]] is used when aiming to slim down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:27">[03:26:27]</a>. While often bought frozen in bags for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:49">[03:28:49]</a>, the author demonstrates making it from scratch:

### Making Cauliflower Rice from Scratch

1.  Cut cauliflower into florets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:43">[03:33:43]</a>.
2.  Process a few florets at a time in a food processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:36">[03:35:36]</a>.
3.  Ensure florets are cut into smaller chunks first, otherwise they just spin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:27">[03:39:27]</a>.
4.  Continue processing until the cauliflower is blended into small grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:17">[03:44:17]</a>.
    *   *Note*: This process can be messy and release sulfur compounds, leading to an unpleasant smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>. The author admits to preferring frozen bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:04">[03:55:04]</a>.

### Cooking Cauliflower Rice

*   Add some olive oil and salt to the processed cauliflower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:25">[03:57:25]</a>.
*   Turn on the heat and cook for about five minutes due to the fine pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:15">[04:00:15]</a>. The water in the pot essentially steams itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:56">[04:03:56]</a>.
*   [[cooking_techniques | Cooking]] is essential for both palatability and digestibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:14">[04:08:14]</a>.

### Meal Storage and Consumption

*   After cooking, the fish and cauliflower rice can be combined and stored in the fridge for almost a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   The author eats the meal whenever hungry, often without reheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:03">[04:34:03]</a>.
*   A squeeze of lemon can freshen up the taste, especially for older portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:40">[04:41:40]</a>.

## Additional Meal: Simple [[vegetable_soup_recipe_for_weight_management | Vegetable Soup]]

A simple [[vegetable_soup_recipe_for_weight_management | vegetable soup]] is another go-to meal for reducing weight, and is one of the author's favorites at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:47">[05:20:47]</a>.

### Soup Recipe Details

1.  **Start**: Green Vidalia onions and a big carrot are chopped and boiled in water (not stock) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:41">[05:32:41]</a>.
2.  **Additions**:
    *   Chopped tomatoes (skins and all for nutrition and thickening pectin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:35">[05:50:35]</a>.
    *   A small amount of white wine for flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:58">[05:55:58]</a>.
3.  **Later Additions**:
    *   Once carrots and onions are half-cooked, add cabbage or kale (ideally crinkly variety) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:21">[06:01:21]</a>.
    *   When cabbage/kale is tender, add fresh chopped garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:56">[06:06:56]</a>.
    *   Season with plenty of salt, a little pepper, and a dash of vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:29">[06:10:29]</a>.
    *   Frozen peas are added at the very end to thaw in residual heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:37">[06:15:37]</a>.
4.  **Serving**: Drizzle with raw olive oil in the bowl to aid digestion of fat-soluble vitamins and for taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:15">[06:19:15]</a>, and add a little fresh herb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:43">[06:24:43]</a>.

### Managing Cruciferous Vegetable Side Effects

*   Introducing many cruciferous vegetables (like cabbage and cauliflower) and beans all at once can cause gas due to large sugars (oligosaccharides) that the body cannot digest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:05">[06:35:05]</a>. These pass to the lower intestine and are metabolized by gut microorganisms, producing gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **Solution**: Consider taking a supplement containing the enzyme alpha galactosidase, which breaks down these sugars before gut bacteria can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:17">[06:40:17]</a>.

## Supplements

*   **Protein Shakes**: Whey protein isolate is used daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:16">[05:52:16]</a>.
    *   A 2018 study found disturbing amounts of heavy metals, arsenic, and BPA in some popular protein powders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. It's important to buy "good ones" from trusted lists if consuming regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:02">[05:14:02]</a>.
*   **Creatine**: Mixed into protein shakes once a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:41">[05:54:41]</a>. It is considered arguably the only legal [[strength_training_versus_cardio_for_weight_loss | strength training]] supplement "worth a damn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:06">[05:56:06]</a>.
*   **Other**: A multivitamin and fish oil supplements are also taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:05">[07:21:05]</a>.

## General Weight Loss Advice

*   **Oral Hygiene**: Brushing and flossing frequently can help curb cravings for sweets by removing bad tastes in the mouth after meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   **Getting Started**: The hardest part of losing weight is keeping it off, but the second hardest part is getting started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:17">[07:30:17]</a>. Pushing through the pain of the first week or so makes it much easier as momentum builds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:22">[07:38:22]</a>.

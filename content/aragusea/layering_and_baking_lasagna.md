Making a lasagna can be an extensive process, often spread over three days to manage the labor involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This approach allows for individual components like the Bolognese sauce, fresh pasta, and cheese sauce to be prepared in advance, leading to a complex and flavorful final dish.

## Component Preparation (Day 1 & 2)

### Bolognese Sauce
The Bolognese sauce, described as non-traditional, forms a core layer of the [[lasagna_recipe | lasagna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Ingredients**: A pound of carrots, a large red onion, a pound of chicken livers, three pounds of ground meat, a small can of tomato paste, a bottle of white wine, three large cans of crushed tomatoes, a spoonful of liquid chicken bouillon (optional), dried herbs, pepper, and balsamic vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Preparation**:
    1.  Process carrots and red onion in a food processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
    2.  Fry the processed vegetables in a large Dutch oven, then remove them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
    3.  Cook the ground meat on high heat, stirring aggressively to break it up, until water boils off and meat fries in its own fat and browns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
    4.  Add chicken livers and tomato paste; when the pan starts to burn, pour in white wine and scrape the bottom clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
    5.  Return the cooked vegetables to the pot, add crushed tomatoes, and optionally, liquid chicken bouillon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    6.  Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for three hours, stirring occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    7.  During the final hour, add dried herbs, pepper, and balsamic vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The acidity is noted to brighten the flavors in the lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
    8.  Taste and adjust seasoning with salt or more vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    9.  The recipe yields about twice the amount needed for the lasagna; cool the sauce and refrigerate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Fresh Pasta Sheets
Two types of fresh pasta dough are prepared: a standard yellow egg pasta and a green spinach pasta. While a food processor simplifies dough making, it's not essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

*   **Spinach Preparation for Green Pasta**:
    1.  Boil about 8 ounces of spinach (one bag or half a bin) until wilted, approximately 2 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Covering the pot helps it steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    2.  Prepare a bowl of ice water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    3.  Transfer the wilted spinach to the ice water to shock it, which sets the green color and prevents browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    4.  Squeeze as much water out of the spinach as possible before adding it to the food processor for the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

*   **Yellow Egg Pasta Dough**:
    1.  Combine four eggs, a teaspoon of salt, and two cups of flour in a food processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    2.  Whizz until it forms one giant ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This dough uses more egg than traditional fresh pasta, which helps it stay firm after baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    3.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

*   **Green Spinach Pasta Dough**:
    1.  Combine the squeezed spinach with three eggs and a teaspoon of salt in a food processor; the spinach counts as the moisture of one egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
    2.  Whizz to cut up the spinach, then add two cups of flour and whizz again until it forms one big ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
    3.  Wrap the dough in plastic wrap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

*   **Dough Hydration and Rolling**:
    1.  Refrigerate both doughs for at least half an hour to hydrate, preventing them from falling apart when rolled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    2.  Use a 6-inch wide pasta roller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    3.  Dust a dough ball with flour and cut it in half for easier handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
    4.  Smoosh into a rectangle, dust with flour, and run through the thickest setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    5.  Fold, dust, and run through multiple times to knead and incorporate the right amount of flour until it rolls smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
    6.  Gradually reduce the thickness setting, sending the dough through each time, until it reaches the second-to-last setting for lasagna, ensuring it doesn't go mushy when baked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

*   **Cutting and Cooking Pasta Sheets**:
    1.  Cut pasta strips as long as the baking pan (e.g., 17 inches for an 11x19 inch pan), accounting for a couple of inches of expansion during boiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Kitchen scissors are effective for cutting pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    2.  Boil water in the biggest pot available with generous pinches of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    3.  Lay pasta ribbons into the boiling water for about two minutes, until they puff up and float aggressively to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    4.  Immediately transfer cooked pasta to ice water to stop the cooking process and prevent gumminess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
    5.  Lay kitchen towels on a table, pull out one noodle at a time, swipe off excess water, and lay them side-by-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Dry the top-facing sides with another towel; they don't need to be bone-dry, but should not be soaking wet to prevent dissolving or making the lasagna runny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
    6.  Repeat for all pasta dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Cheese Sauce
This cheese sauce serves as a primary source of salt for the entire [[lasagna_recipe | lasagna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Ingredients**: A stick of butter, a whole head of garlic, flour (no more than a cup), a half-gallon of milk, and a 7-ounce block of Pecorino cheese (or Parmesan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Pecorino's acidity is preferred for cutting through the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Preparation**:
    1.  Melt butter in a large pan over medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    2.  Chop garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
    3.  Whisk in flour to make a thick paste (a roux) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    4.  Add garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    5.  Gradually whisk in milk a little at a time to avoid sloshing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
    6.  Once all milk is in, remove the pan from heat and let it cool until it stops bubbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    7.  Grate the entire block of cheese into the sauce when it's off the boil; adding it while boiling would make the cheese grainy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    8.  Whisk the cheese in; don't worry if it's not totally smooth as it will melt in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
    9.  Taste and add more salt, aiming for it to be deliberately too salty initially as it's the main salt source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Layering and Initial Baking (Day 2)

### Assembly
1.  Place a sheet pan under the foil pan (e.g., 11x19 inch disposable pan) for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
2.  Oil the foil pan to prevent sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
3.  Lay in the first layer of pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Broken noodles don't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
4.  Apply a layer of cheese sauce. It helps if the cheese sauce is warm for easier spreading into a thin layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
5.  Alternate layers of green pasta, Bolognese sauce (which should be at room temperature for easier spreading), yellow pasta, and cheese sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
6.  Build up as many alternating layers as there is pasta and sauce available; typically seven layers are achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
7.  On the very top layer, dab small streaks of both Bolognese and cheese sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### First Bake
1.  Bake the assembled lasagna in a 400°F (200°C) oven for 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
2.  After the first bake, let the lasagna cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
3.  Refrigerate the lasagna for Day 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Final Baking and Serving (Day 3)

### Quick Tomato Sauce
A quick tomato sauce is made for serving the lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Ingredients**: Garlic, shallots, oil, tomato paste, two 28-ounce cans of crushed tomatoes, a splash of white wine (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Preparation**:
    1.  Fry garlic and shallots in oil with a squeeze of tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
    2.  Add crushed tomatoes and white wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
    3.  Season and simmer for half an hour, stirring frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
    4.  Test for seasoning before serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Final Bake and Serving
1.  Roughly grate about a pound of mozzarella cheese for topping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
2.  When the lasagna is chilled, cut it into desired portions (e.g., 12 pieces for large servings, 15 or 18 for smaller portions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Cutting it cold ensures clean cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
3.  Oil a baking sheet. Do not use foil as the lasagna may stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
4.  Lift out individual pieces with a spatula and place them on the oiled baking sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
5.  Cover the top of each piece with grated mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
6.  Bake at 400°F (200°C), preferably with a convection setting to help brown everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
7.  Allow 20 minutes for heating through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Keep pieces separated for hot air circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
8.  If cheese isn't browning sufficiently, use the broiler at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
9.  To serve, spread a thin layer of the quick red sauce on the plate and float the heated lasagna piece on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
10. Garnish with fresh basil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

This two-stage baking method ensures every piece is an "edge" piece, and baked pasta dishes are often considered better on the second day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

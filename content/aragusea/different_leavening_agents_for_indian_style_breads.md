From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Indian-style breads, such as naan, exhibit a remarkable diversity in the leavening agents used to achieve their characteristic textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Historically, and even in modern recipes, various methods are employed, sometimes in combination.

## Traditional and Modern Leaveners

### Curd (Yogurt)
One of the original leaveners for Indian breads is curd, specifically yogurt containing live, active bacterial cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. When mixed with flour, these cultures can cause the dough to puff up over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Many [[differences_between_yeast_and_no_yeast_dough_for_naan | no yeast naan recipes]] depend on these bacteria for leavening, often requiring the dough to sit for many hours in a warm place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:04">[03:22:04]</a>.

### Dried Yeast
Dried yeast is another common leavener used in Indian breads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Chemical Leaveners
Chemical leaveners, such as baking soda and baking powder, are also utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Combinations of Leaveners
Some traditional Indian cookbooks feature naan recipes that call for all three types of leaveners: curd (yogurt), dried yeast, and chemical leaveners like baking soda and baking powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This approach can be seen as a culmination of millennia of [[bread_baking_techniques | baking history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Naan Dough Formulations

### No-Yeast Naan Dough
For making [[making_garlic_naan_without_yeast_or_oven | restaurant-quality garlic naan at home without an oven]], a no-yeast dough recipe is often preferred for its texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This dough typically includes:
*   All-purpose flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>
*   Sugar (to enhance browning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>
*   Salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>
*   Double-acting baking powder (helps with texture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>
*   Baking soda (to neutralize the yogurt's acidity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>
*   Oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>
*   Yogurt (containing live cultures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>
*   Milk or water to bring the dough together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>

The dough should be soft and barely sticky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. While it's a quick bread that *could* be cooked immediately, allowing it to sit for at least half an hour (or many hours) under a wet towel improves bubble formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. The puffing observed in this dough, even without yeast, is attributed to both the chemical leavening and the live bacteria in the yogurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

### Yeast Naan Dough
A yeast-based naan dough uses similar ingredients but with different ratios for the leaveners:
*   Flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>
*   Sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>
*   Salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>
*   Dry yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>
*   Baking powder (often included even with yeast) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>
*   Olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>
*   A small amount of yogurt (too much yogurt with yeast can result in a cake-like texture due to acidity weakening gluten) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>
*   More milk or water than the no-yeast version, due to less moisture from yogurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>

Like any yeast bread, this dough requires at least an hour of rising time at room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

## Leavening Effects and Cooking
When cooking naan on a cast iron skillet using the tawa style (where the dough sticks to the pan and then is inverted over a burner):
*   **No-Yeast Dough:** This dough tends to produce the desired "three or four smaller bubbles" on the surface, replicating restaurant-style naan more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. The bubbles are likely inflated by steam, though double-acting baking powder also aids in aerating the texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
*   **Yeast Dough:** This dough tends to puff up more evenly with many tiny bubbles throughout, rather than forming the large, crisp bubbles characteristic of tandoor-style naan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. While the flavor might be superior due to yeast fermentation, the texture can be less desirable, resembling a Western dinner roll rather than the crispy, bubbly layers of naan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. It's suggested that the intense heat of a tandoor might be necessary to achieve the desired texture with yeast dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

Most recipes for tawa-style naan specifically recommend using a no-yeast dough for optimal results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

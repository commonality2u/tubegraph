From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Achieving restaurant-quality garlic naan at home is possible without a tandoor or even an oven, using just a pan on a stove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method, often referred to as "tawa style" naan, relies on specific dough preparation and cooking techniques to replicate the desired texture and flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Naan Dough: No Yeast Version

While [[different_leavening_agents_for_indian_style_breads | Indian style breads]] can use various leaveners like yogurt, dried yeast, or chemical leaveners (baking soda and baking powder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, a no-yeast dough often yields better results for this stove-top method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Most tawa naan recipes also typically call for no yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Ingredients
For about four loaves of naan, you will need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>:
*   2 cups (approximately 250 grams) all-purpose flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   1 teaspoon sugar (enhances browning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   ½ teaspoon salt (more can be added as a topping later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   1 teaspoon double-acting baking powder (improves texture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   A scant ¼ teaspoon baking soda (to neutralize the yogurt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   2 tablespoons of oil (e.g., olive oil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   About ¼ cup (approximately 60 grams) plain yogurt containing live active bacterial cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
*   Enough milk or water to bring the dough together (start with ½ cup/100 ml, then add more as needed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>

### Dough Preparation
1.  **Mixing**: Combine all dry ingredients. Add the oil and yogurt. Gradually add milk or water, starting with a smaller amount and kneading in more liquid as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Indian dough recipes often start dry and then add liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
2.  **Kneading**: Knead until the dough is soft but only barely sticky, similar to a [[making_new_yorkstyle_pizza_dough_at_home | pizza dough]] but slightly drier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The gluten is sufficiently developed when the dough bounces back after being pressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
3.  **Resting**: Lightly oil the dough to prevent drying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Although it's a quick bread, letting it sit for at least 30 minutes under a wet towel is crucial for bubble formation. It improves further with longer resting times, even many hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The yogurt's bacteria contribute to some puffing during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
4.  **Final Kneading**: Shortly before cooking, knead the dough a little more. This helps prevent one large bubble and encourages three or four smaller bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Divide the dough into four equal balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### [[Differences between yeast and no yeast dough for naan | No-Yeast vs. Yeast Dough for Tawa Naan]]
Yeast dough tends to puff up evenly with tiny bubbles and may not stick as securely to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While the flavor from yeast fermentation can be superior, the texture of tawa-style naan made with yeast dough might resemble a Western dinner roll, lacking the crisp, bubbly layers of restaurant-style naan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The no-yeast dough generally works better for the tawa method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Preparing Garlic and Toppings
1.  **Garlic Preparation**: For garlic naan, how the garlic is cut matters. Grating, pressing, or crushing garlic with salt yields thin, stringy pieces that adhere better to the dough compared to chopped garlic, which tends to fall out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
2.  **Toppings**: Fresh chopped cilantro is a common addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. You can use other toppings as desired, similar to a [[easy_method_for_making_pan_pizza | pan pizza]] or [[making_new_yorkstyle_pizza_dough_at_home | New York-style pizza]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
3.  **Incorporating Toppings**: A traditional method is to roll the toppings into the dough. This embeds them, making them part of the bread while maintaining some heterogeneity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Cooking Method: Tawa Style on the Stove

This method replicates the effect of a tandoor oven without specialized equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

### Rolling the Dough
1.  **Rolling**: Rather than using flour, let the dough stick to your counter. This provides stability and prevents the dough from snapping back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
2.  **Rolling Pin Technique**: To prevent sticking to the rolling pin, roll outwards and off the dough, rather than back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
3.  **Thickness**: Aim for a thickness just slightly less than the thinnest possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Stove-Top Cooking
1.  **Pan Preparation**: Before cooking, wet the bottom side of the rolled dough. This dissolves surface starch, creating a sticky paste that helps the naan adhere to the pan, mimicking how it would stick to a tandoor wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
2.  **Pan Choice**: A cast iron skillet works well for this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. A flat, round griddle pan called a "tawa" is traditionally used by Indian cooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Stainless steel pans are generally less effective as the dough tends not to stick well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Ensure your cast iron pan has a good seasoning layer for proper sticking and releasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
3.  **Heat**: Place the dough on a medium to slightly less than medium heat. The exact temperature will require some experimentation for your specific stove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
4.  **Cooking the Bottom**: Cook for 1-2 minutes until you see bubbles forming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. These bubbles are likely inflated by steam, possibly from chemical leaveners initially creating air pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. You can tell the bottom is done when the edges look dry or by a slight whiff of a burned smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The dough must stick to the pan, so avoid un-sticking it to check the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
5.  **Cooking the Top (Inversion Method)**: For gas or electric coil stoves, invert the pan directly over the burner and turn the heat to high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This method won't work on induction stoves because they don't heat the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
6.  **Desired Top Finish**: Aim for some singeing on the bubbles while the rest of the surface still looks almost raw. This is key to the restaurant-style naan texture, where parts of the surface remain slightly doughy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
7.  **Post-Cook Cleanup**: After each naan, quickly wash and dry the pan to remove residue, which could interfere with the sticking process for the next loaf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

## Finishing Touches
1.  **Butter**: A generous brushing of melted butter is the final ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Salted butter can complement slightly under-seasoned dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
2.  **Unsticking**: It might be challenging to unstick the bread from a cast iron skillet due to its sides, which a tawa wouldn't have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

The tawa style method provides a baked flavor because the bottom cooks on a starch paste layer instead of fat, and the top cooks in very hot, dry air, resulting in crispy bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### [[Alternative methods of baking pizza | Alternative Baking Methods]]
If you have an induction stove or prefer not to invert the pan:
*   Cook the bread until the bottom is done, then flip it to brown the other side slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   The key is to allow the surface to remain a little doughy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   While the texture may not be as good as the hot-air cooked top, it will still taste baked and not fried, due to the absence of oil in the cooking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

This method requires practice, but the results can be extraordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

Chilies can be prepared in various ways to add flavor and heat to dishes, serving as both an ingredient within a sauce and a standalone garnish. For dishes like [[spaghetti_allassassina_preparation | spaghetti allassassina]], chilies contribute to the overall flavor profile and visual appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Charred Pickled Chili Garnish

A non-traditional, yet complementary, garnish involves charred pickled chilies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Ingredients
*   Small, mild chilies (e.g., serrano chilies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   Sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Any vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

### Preparation
1.  **Prepare the Quick Pickle Solution**: Combine a big pinch of sugar, a pinch of salt, and some vinegar in a small bowl. The sugar may not fully dissolve at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
2.  **Char the Chilies**: Use tongs to hold the chilies directly in the flame of a gas burner, rotating them until almost blackened all over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   *Alternative [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | techniques]]*: If a gas stove is unavailable, a kitchen torch or oven broiler can be used, though this garnish is considered optional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
3.  **Soak**: Immediately transfer the hot, charred chilies to the quick pickle solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The internal softness of the chili will develop as it sits in the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
4.  **Serve**: The chilies will taste like pickles by the time the rest of the meal is cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Flavor Profile
This garnish offers a smoky, sweet, and sour taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> that complements the often spicy and intensely sweet and sour tomato sauce found in [[spaghetti_allassassina_preparation | spaghetti allassassina]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Chilies for Sauce

For sauces, chilies contribute heat and a noticeable vegetable presence.

### Preparation
1.  **Select Chilies**: Jalape√±os are a suitable choice and can be sliced thickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  **Adjust Heat**: To reduce heat, remove the white pith from some or all of the chili rounds, as most of the heat resides there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This is an alternative to the traditional use of dried red chili flakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
3.  **Cooking**: The prepared chilies (peppers) can be added to the pan with olive oil and garlic for a head start before other ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. As pasta is added, the chilies will be displaced towards the pan's rim, reducing the likelihood of burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

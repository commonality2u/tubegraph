Mozzarella is widely considered the best cheese for pizza, with a 2014 study confirming it provides the desired browning and stretching properties [00:00:15]. However, mozzarella comes in various forms, each with distinct characteristics impacting its suitability for different pizza styles.

## Fresh Mozzarella

Fresh mozzarella is characterized by its soft, high-moisture, and milky consistency [00:01:15]. It tastes sweet, fresh, and subtle, often described as solidified milk [00:01:23]. Historically, mozzarella originated in Italy, often made from water buffalo milk, which contributes to its high-fat product nature [00:01:01]. Dr. Lucy from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, an expert in food science, describes its high moisture content [00:01:29].

When used on pizza, fresh mozzarella is notably wet, releasing whey even before being cut [00:01:32]. It is too soft to shred, tending to "smoosh" [00:01:40]. On a [[neapolitan_vs_new_york_style_pizza_cheese_preferences | New York style pizza]] (wide, thin, with a solid sheet of cheese), this high moisture content can lead to an unappetizingly soggy crust [00:02:06].

Fresh mozzarella is traditionally used in [[neapolitan_vs_new_york_style_pizza_cheese_preferences | Neapolitan style pizza]] [00:02:59]. A key difference between [[neapolitan_vs_new_york_style_pizza_cheese_preferences | Neapolitan style]] and [[neapolitan_vs_new_york_style_pizza_cheese_preferences | New York style pizza]] is the amount of cheese used: [[neapolitan_vs_new_york_style_pizza_cheese_preferences | Neapolitan style]] features splotches rather than a full sheet of cheese, allowing the pizza to cook without becoming soggy [00:02:51].

## Low-Moisture Mozzarella

Low-moisture mozzarella, often referred to as "pizza cheese" in the industry [00:03:57], was developed in the United States, particularly in dairy-producing regions like Wisconsin, after World War II [00:03:26]. This innovation addressed the challenges of using fresh mozzarella in mass production, as fresh mozzarella was too wet, soft, messy, and not shelf-stable for commercial use [00:03:40].

By removing some fat and a lot of whey, manufacturers created a firmer, more stable product suitable for mass production [00:04:01].

### Manufacturing Process of Low-Moisture Mozzarella
The [[manufacturing_processes_of_mozzarella_cheese_and_their_effects | manufacturing process]] for low-moisture mozzarella involves:
*   Standardizing milk to a lower fat content [00:04:07].
*   Adding rennet (an enzyme) to coagulate the milk [00:04:14].
*   Introducing particular bacterial cultures to ferment the lactose, which lowers the pH [00:04:17].
*   Heating the cheese in a cooker-stretcher to around 60°C (140°F), which pasteurizes it, deactivates some bacteria and enzymes, and extends shelf life [00:04:24].

Unlike physically squeezing water out of fresh mozzarella, the moisture removal in low-moisture mozzarella is achieved chemically through enzymes and acid [00:05:11]. This chemical process also affects the taste, resulting in a sharper flavor compared to fresh mozzarella [00:05:53]. Brands like Grande use bacterial fermentation for acidification, while Palio (in the New York area) uses vinegar [00:05:27]. This more acidic quality is considered key for [[neapolitan_vs_new_york_style_pizza_cheese_preferences | New York style pizza]] [00:06:03].

When used on [[neapolitan_vs_new_york_style_pizza_cheese_preferences | New York style pizza]], low-moisture mozzarella results in nice browning, a crispy and dry crust, and a firmer cheese with a slight "snap" when cooled [00:04:45].

### Full-Fat Low-Moisture Mozzarella (WM LM)

[[neapolitan_vs_new_york_style_pizza_cheese_preferences | New York style pizza]] is often made with full-fat low-moisture mozzarella (Whole Milk Low Moisture, or WM LM) [00:06:08]. This type of cheese is harder to find in grocery stores for a couple of reasons [00:06:23]:
*   **Grease Layer**: Higher fat content can produce a grease layer, which some consumers may not prefer [00:06:29].
*   **Machinability**: Part-skim cheese is firmer and easier to cut and shred by machines, making it more suitable for large-scale manufacturing [00:06:42].

Despite these challenges, many prefer the rich flavor of full-fat cheese [00:07:03]. It can sometimes be found at deli counters [00:07:11] or, surprisingly, in forms like string cheese, as was the case with Galbani's full-fat sticks [00:07:31]. Walmart also carries a full-fat low-moisture mozzarella [00:09:01].

### Medium-Moisture Mozzarella

Some retail brands, like certain Palio products, are not true low-moisture cheese but rather "medium moisture" [00:08:26]. This type is softer and wetter than low-moisture mozzarella [00:08:24], can rise significantly in the oven and boil over, and often results in a wet pizza with a less desirable flavor [00:08:30]. Nutritional facts may even differ between retail and commercial versions of the same brand [00:08:48].

### Preshredded Mozzarella

Preshredded mozzarella is convenient, but it includes an anti-caking blend (e.g., corn starch, potato starch, calcium sulfate) to prevent the cheese from clumping together in the bag [00:09:30]. This anti-caking agent can negatively impact the cheese's performance on pizza:
*   **Melting and Browning Interference**: The added materials might not melt at pizza baking temperatures [00:09:55]. If too much is present, it can create a "battered" or "breaded" effect, preventing the cheese from melting properly [00:10:07].
*   **Moisture Absorption**: Anti-caking agents can soak up moisture released during baking, making the cheese surface too dry and leading to toasting or burning [00:10:20].

This is largely a quality control issue, as some producers use too much anti-caking mix [00:10:51]. While it's still possible to make good pizza with preshredded cheese, experimenting with different brands is recommended if one isn't working [00:10:45].

Palm oil's widespread use presents significant [[History and production of palm oil | environmental challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Journalist Jocelyn Zuckerman's book "Planet Palm" explores how this oil has come to "endanger the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Drivers of Environmental Impact

One key factor contributing to the environmental footprint of palm oil is its exceptional productivity. The yield per acre of cultivated land for oil palm is significantly higher than any other oil crop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. While other vegetable oils require much more land to produce the same amount of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, the sheer scale of palm oil production leads to massive environmental consequences. Its natural suitability for many commercial applications and its extreme cheapness also contribute to its widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Consequences of Production

### Deforestation and Global Warming
The expansion of oil palm plantations has led to extensive deforestation of vital tropical rainforests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. This deforestation contributes significantly to global warming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Habitat Devastation
Alongside its contribution to global warming, deforestation for palm oil has devastated habitats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Orangutans, a species closely related to humans, are widely known to be losing their homes due to oil palm expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. However, orangutans are "hardly the only important species to be affected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Pollution
In areas like Liberia, rivers have been poisoned by agrichemicals used in oil palm production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Workers on plantations in Central America also experience exposure to agrichemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Efforts Towards Sustainability

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) confers a label for products aiming for sustainable palm oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. However, concerns exist about the effectiveness of RSPO certifications, with reports of workers being coached to provide favorable information to investigators and facing punishment if they don't follow the script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

Some small-holder farms, like those in Ecuador working with Natural Habitats, attempt to produce and sell palm oil responsibly by collaborating with natural habitats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Despite impressive efforts, these represent only a tiny fraction of the overall market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

The challenge of palm oil's environmental impact is not solely a consumer issue; it is suggested that individuals in countries like the United States may simply need to consume less overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Focusing "consumption guilt" on one product or ingredient may lead to a false sense of moral superiority while ignoring similar problems elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

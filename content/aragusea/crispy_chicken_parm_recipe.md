This recipe offers an advanced take on an Italian grandmother's classic chicken parmesan, focusing on techniques for achieving a crispy crust and flavorful chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Preparing the Chicken

Chicken breasts are used for this recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

1.  **Butterfly and Halve the Chicken** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>
    *   Chicken breasts are typically too thick, so cut them in half lengthwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
    *   This ensures a better meat-to-crust proportion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
2.  **Pound the Chicken** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
    *   Use a meat mallet, a heavy glass, or a spiked tenderizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
    *   Pounding flattens and tenderizes the meat, creating holes for the marinade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
3.  **Season the Chicken** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
    *   Season the meat directly with a heavy sprinkling of salt and pepper on each side, rather than seasoning the breading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
4.  **Marinate the Chicken** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
    *   Place the seasoned chicken in a bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   Add a big heap of chopped garlic (four to five cloves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   Splash a little white wine into the bowl, swish it around, and toss the chicken in the fridge to marinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Making the Quick Tomato Sauce

This sauce is designed to cook quickly in a pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

1.  **Sauté Aromatics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
    *   Chop the remaining garlic and one shallot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
        *   Shallots are preferred over onions as they are smaller and easier to chop finely, providing a single-serving portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
    *   Heat olive oil in a pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   Fry off the shallots and garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   Add tomato paste, which gives intense flavor to a quick sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Frying it helps to mellow its flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
2.  **Simmer the Sauce** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>
    *   Add a good quality can of crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   Pour in a glug of white wine, especially if you already have it open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   Reduce heat to a simmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   Cook in a pan, not a pot, to maximize surface area for evaporation, allowing it to cook in a half-hour at most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   Stir often to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   Season with salt and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
    *   Add fresh basil right before serving to keep it green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Breading the Chicken

This process involves a specialized [[breading_chicken_with_panko_and_cheese | breading method]] to maximize crispiness and flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

1.  **Prepare the Breading Station** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
    *   Set up three stations: flour, beaten egg, and the panko/cheese mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   Beat the egg well for even coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
2.  **Make the Panko and Cheese Blend** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
    *   Use panko breadcrumbs, which are made by electrocuting bread dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   Measure about half a cup of panko per piece of chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   Grind the panko flakes down slightly with your hands to make them less jagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   Grate Parmesan or Pecorino cheese onto the panko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
        *   The amount of cheese should be almost as large as the pile of breadcrumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
        *   The saltiness of the Pecorino will season the breading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
        *   All the cheese goes *into* the breading and is fried, rather than melting a layer on top later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
3.  **Coat the Chicken** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
    *   First, pat the marinated chicken dry with paper towels to prevent a gooey breading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   Dredge the chicken in flour (flour sticks to meat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   Dip in egg (egg sticks to flour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
    *   Coat heavily in the panko and cheese mixture (breadcrumbs stick to egg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Frying the Chicken

1.  **Heat Oil** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
    *   Pour a heavy coating of olive oil into a pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   The oil should produce a gentle sizzle when the chicken is added; if it's too hot, the cheese in the breading will burn easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
2.  **Cook Chicken** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>
    *   Lay the chicken into the hot oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   Flip when the chicken is golden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
    *   Thinner pieces of chicken typically cook through by the time both sides have a golden crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. These pieces took six minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   While not necessary for this recipe due to the thinness, a meat thermometer can be used to check for 160°F (71°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
3.  **Drain and Rest** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
    *   Drain the cooked chicken on a cooling rack rather than paper towels to keep it crispier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   The chicken will continue to cook slightly while resting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Serving Suggestions

*   If desired, you can add mozzarella and melt it under a broiler at this stage, but the recipe suggests there's already plenty of cheese, and melting mozzarella can reduce the surface crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   To retain crunch, put the tomato sauce on the plate, not directly on the chicken, leaving most of the chicken dry and crispy until eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Serve with spaghetti, topped with a little more cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   Pair with a glass of red wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

The white wine marinade makes the chicken sweet and bright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

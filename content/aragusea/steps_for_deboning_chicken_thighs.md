Deboning chicken thighs can be a useful skill, especially since finding skin-on, boneless chicken thighs can be challenging in stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. While there are academic methods like "dislocation of articular cartilage followed by stripping periosteum," a simpler, albeit cruder, home method exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Recommended Tools

To debone a chicken thigh, it is recommended to use a [[Using kitchen tools for deboning | boning knife]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. These knives are inexpensive because they are stamped, not forged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. A boning knife has a very thin blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Deboning Steps

The following steps outline an easy method for deboning chicken thighs:

1.  **Initial Cut**
    *   Make one cut directly down the middle, on top of the thigh bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
    *   Make another cut along one side of the bone, cutting as deep as the bone goes but not all the way through to the cutting board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   Repeat the side cut on the other side of the bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Focus only on the middle section of the bone, not the ends near the joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

2.  **Freeing the Bone**
    *   Carefully slide the knife underneath the middle of the bone, going in one side and out the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
    *   Saw a little bit to create a larger hole, big enough to stick a finger through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
    *   Insert the knife again, facing away from your finger, and saw out until you can push all the way through, freeing one joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   For the second joint, it's often easier to lever the bone away and cut around the joint until it's free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Post-Deboning Cleanup

After deboning, the thigh meat will have a more even thickness, allowing it to cook more evenly and quickly, while also allowing for more flavor penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. To ensure a pleasant eating experience:

*   **Remove Cartilage:** Feel around where the joints were and slice off any gross bits of cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Trim Blubbery Fat:** Look for small pieces of blubbery fat, especially around the edge of the skin. These won't render down completely and will remain slimy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Trim them off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Address Skin Flap Fat:** If there's a flap of skin hanging off the side, trim it off, as there's often a slimy, blubbery fat bit underneath where it meets the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This fat can be cut or scraped off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Any bones removed can be frozen for making stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

### Removing Skin

If a recipe calls for skinless chicken thighs:

1.  Lift the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
2.  You may need to use your knife to open up the membrane underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
3.  Once the membrane is open, the skin can often be pulled off until it resists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
4.  At that point, simply cut the remaining attached skin off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

Skinless, boneless chicken thighs are often preferred for wet cooking methods like stews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

In the earliest days of human [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking]], complex methods like soup, stew, brazing, blanching, poaching, or frying did not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## [[Roasting chicken techniques | Roasting]]: The First Method

The human ancestor, Homo erectus, began [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] their food hundreds of thousands of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This earliest form of [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] almost certainly involved dry heating methods, such as simply jamming food onto a stick and holding it straight into a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. [[Roasting chicken techniques | Roasting]] is considered the very beginning of all [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Wet Cooking: The Pot Boiler Method

Tens of thousands of years after the advent of [[roasting_chicken_techniques | roasting]], the concept of wet [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. One of the primary early methods for simmering food involved "pot boilers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This technique used hot rocks, dropped into a water-safe container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This method was used for thousands of years until more advanced water and fire-safe [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] vessels became available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The exact origins of the first soup or stew remain unknown, as the materials used for early wet [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] (like animal hides or woven baskets) decompose quickly and leave little archaeological evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Much of the current understanding is based on scholarly speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

In 2015, anthropologist John Speth proposed that stew or soup might be much older than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. He empirically demonstrated that a flammable material, like an animal hide, filled with wet food can be held directly over a fire without burning, due to the water it contains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. However, such methods might put out the fire if water drips onto it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Ancient people might have used more waterproof, less drippy containers such as animal stomachs or clay-lined woven baskets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Archaeological evidence suggests Neanderthals ate wet-cooked food. A grain of barley recovered from a Neanderthal's teeth in modern-day Iraq, dating back approximately 50,000 years, appears to have been boiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Simulating a Pot Boiler

A simple pot boiler setup can be created by digging a hole, lining it with a large leaf (like a banana leaf) to hold water, and then adding food like grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Smooth river cobbles are a good choice for heating in a separate fire, as they are less likely to chip into the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. These hot stones are then carefully transferred into the water-filled basin to boil the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

When stones are repeatedly heated and rapidly cooled, they develop a characteristic pattern of cracking and glazing known as "crazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Crazed river cobbles first appear in the archaeological record around 30,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. While their use as pot boilers isn't always certain (they could have been hearth stones), pot boilers definitively became a common [[nontraditional_cooking_methods | cooking method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This technique persisted well into the era of written history and is still used by some people today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

*   Wet [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] with a pot boiler is surprisingly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   The water is kept safely away from the fire, preventing it from being extinguished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   It allows for the preparation of soft-cooked grains in about an hour using basic materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   Unlike grinding grains into flour and baking bread, boiling allows impurities like sand or pebbles to sink to the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Benefits of Wet Cooking

Wet [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] was a significant advance for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>:
*   More nutrients can be extracted from food because nothing drips onto the fire and is wasted; all nutrients are preserved in the broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Extremely tough foods can be softened into a form that is easy to chew and digest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   Soup allows for feeding more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Nixtamalization and Pot Boilers

Scientists believe stone [[history_of_food_boiling_techniques | boiling techniques]] may have led ancient Americans to invent nixtamalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This process involves soaking corn in an alkaline solution to remove the waxy hull and make hominy, grits, and tortillas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Nixtamalization also makes certain amino acids in corn more bioavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Without it, a corn-based diet can lead to pellagra, a severe nutritional deficiency disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The idea for nixtamalization might have arisen accidentally when people boiled corn with limestone pot boilers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. An experiment in 2011 showed that boiling corn with Cedar Mesa Limestone (used by ancient peoples in Utah) produced water strong enough to nixtamalize the corn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## The Invention of the Cooking Pot

While stone [[history_of_food_boiling_techniques | boiling in leaves]] or animal skins was effective, it had disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The invention of the cooking pot, which could be placed directly on a fire, greatly simplified wet [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Early pots were likely made from clay, which is abundant in river basins, forming from the chemical weathering of exposed rock by slightly acidic rainwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The first person to make a pot might have discovered the moldable, plastic qualities of clay-rich dirt while digging a hole for another purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Adding water to the clay and "wedging" it (bashing and working it) makes it more moldable, removes air bubbles, and helps extract large rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

After molding, the pot would be left to dry in the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. A dried clay pot, similar to a mud brick, is surprisingly strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. However, even a very dry clay pot will dissolve in water, creating a muddy broth and eventually melting away, unless it is "fired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### The Firing Process (Kiln)

Firing clay in a kiln at extremely high heat changes its chemical structure into a ceramic material that is hard and won't dissolve in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This process may have been discovered accidentally, perhaps by using fire to accelerate drying or by leaving a dried pot in a fire after its contents boiled out, causing it to fire into ceramic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

The first kilns would have been simple pits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. To fire a pot:
1.  Start a fire in a pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
2.  Place a preheated, dried pot into the pit (rapid heating can cause cracking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
3.  Continuously feed the fire, allowing glowing hot coals to encase the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
4.  Leave the pot to cool for at least 24-48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Early pottery, despite challenges like cracking during firing, allowed for direct boiling over a fire, eliminating the need to shuttle hot rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. While scientists once believed pottery was invented 5,000 to 10,000 years ago, fragments found in a Chinese cave in 2012 date back 20,000 years, making them the oldest known true ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. These fragments showed signs of having been used in a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

Clay pots were the primary [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] vessels for a long time, extending from the Stone Age into the Bronze and Iron Ages, and even into the early modern period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Although metal pots are superior due to better thermal conductivity and less risk of cracking from thermal stress, they were prohibitively expensive for most families until relatively recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. The ceramic pot was a simple, effective, and widespread solution to a universal need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

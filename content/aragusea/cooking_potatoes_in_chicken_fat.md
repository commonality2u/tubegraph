An unconventional method for cooking rotisserie chicken at home also yields potatoes fried in chicken fat cooked beneath the hanging chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This method is efficient for cooking multiple chickens simultaneously if feeding a crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Potato Selection and Preparation

The ideal chicken size for this method is four to five pounds; a larger chicken might burn the potatoes before the chicken is fully cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Seasoning that falls onto the pan during chicken preparation is beneficial as it will season the potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

For the potatoes:
*   **Type** Three pounds (1.5 kg) of floury baking potatoes, such as russets, are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Any large potato that can be cut into big chunks will work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Floury potatoes are better at absorbing the chicken goodness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Peeling** Russet skins are considered unpleasant unless they receive exclusively dry heat, so peeling them is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Cleaning** After peeling, [[impact_of_rinsing_potatoes_before_cooking | wash off]] any dirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Cutting** Cut the potatoes into thick slices, about 1.5 inches (4 cm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. They will shrink significantly during cooking, so discard any pieces that are too small to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Pre-boiling** [[boiling_and_roasting_potatoes | Boil]] the potatoes slightly to achieve a much browner skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Oven Setup and Cooking Process

### Oven Configuration
Set up the oven with one rack in the top position and one in the bottom position, removing any third rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. A convection roast setting at 425째F (220째C) is recommended, though oven variations may require experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Using convection heat is particularly beneficial for this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Initial Placement
Place the boiled potatoes on a pre-seasoned sheet pan, ensuring they are evenly spaced and lying flat in a single layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This pan goes onto the low rack in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Liquid Addition
Pour a thin layer of liquid (chicken stock or water) into the pan with the potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This prevents the potatoes from cooking too quickly and avoids smoke from chicken drippings hitting a bare pan surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Rotation and Drippings
Check the potatoes every 15 minutes, shifting the rack so that all potatoes receive direct drippings from the chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This method is synergistic, as a drip pan would be needed anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. If the oven is not level and stock evaporates unevenly, rotate the pan to redistribute the remaining liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Finishing and Serving the Potatoes

Once the chicken reaches an internal temperature of around 162째F (72째C) after about an hour of roasting, both the chickens and the pan of potatoes can be removed from the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

While the chickens rest, the potatoes can be returned to the oven to crisp further:
1.  Use a stout metal spatula to scrape the potatoes off the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
2.  Flip them to crisp the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
3.  Do not worry if they get "beat up" in this process, as roughed-up surfaces become beautifully crisp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
4.  Place the potatoes on the upper rack for direct heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
5.  After about ten minutes, or when they start to burn, remove the tray and let the potatoes rest alongside the chickens to firm up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

The resulting potatoes are described as a "very crude fondant potato," tasting like a chicken nugget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. They may or may not need finishing salt, as they will have absorbed salt from the chicken and stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Serving with a side salad with an acidic dressing helps cut the richness of the chicken fat in the potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. These "chicken flavored potatoes" are considered "bonkers" and well worth the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

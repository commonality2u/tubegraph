## Initial Purpose and Discovery of Effects
Originally, wooden barrels were used simply to store liquor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. However, it was quickly discovered that storing liquor in wood significantly changed and improved it over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

## Barrel Characteristics and Charring
Barrels used for aging spirits, such as the 53-gallon new white oak char-4 barrel seen aging bourbon at Cardinal Spirits, are specifically prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Charring:** Char-4 refers to the extent to which the inside of the barrel has been burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Historically, barrels might have been charred for cleaning and sterilization, or to remove lingering flavors from previous contents like salted fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. However, it was soon realized that the smoky taste from charring infused into the liquor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **Toasting:** For spirits like brandy, toasted wood barrels are used, which impart different flavor profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

## Mechanism of Flavor Development
Flavor transfer from the wood to the spirit occurs primarily due to the interaction between the liquor and the barrel in environments that are not totally climate-controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. As temperatures change, the barrel expands and contracts, causing the liquor to be sucked in and out of the wood, thereby pushing wood flavors into the spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   **Flavor Profiles:** Charred wood typically imparts flavors like vanilla and sometimes cherry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## Time and Chemical Changes
The aging process can take years, or even decades, to develop a truly smooth spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. During this time, the alcohol itself undergoes its own chemical changes independent of the wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

## Business Considerations
The lengthy aging period means that companies don't see returns on their investment for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. This is why many new distilleries, like Cardinal Spirits, sell unaged spirits such as vodkas, gins, un-aged rums, or liqueurs to generate revenue while their aged products mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. This explains why many famous aged spirit companies are hundreds of years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Variability and Blending
The aging process in barrels can be unpredictable; some barrels yield perfect results, while others, even containing the exact same product aged side-by-side, may require more time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. A master distiller might blend liquor from different barrels to combine various qualities and create a special final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

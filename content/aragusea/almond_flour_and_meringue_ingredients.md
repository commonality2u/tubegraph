The macaron is a beloved old-world pastry that typically consists of two almond meringue cookies sandwiching a filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While often considered fussy, [[challenges_in_making_macarons | macaron]] baking can be made easier by liberating oneself from precious expectations about their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Meringue cookies are described as possibly the most forgiving pastry if you don't get hung up on appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Meringue Components

### Egg Whites
For the meringue, egg whites are easier to separate and beat better if they are warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A simple method to warm them is to leave them in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

To separate eggs, one technique involves cracking the shell and passing the yolk between the two halves until the whites ooze into a bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This method avoids dirtying extra dishes, but risks starting over if the yolk punctures and falls into the whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Due to the variable size of eggs and the need for precision in this recipe, it's necessary to weigh the egg whites on a gram scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The egg whites should be beaten until they are just fluffy and foamy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. There's no need to risk over-beating them at this initial stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. While a stand mixer can be used, an electric hand mixer can also suffice and may offer more control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Sugar
Sugar is added to the beaten egg whites. The recipe suggests using about 1/2 a cup of normal granulated sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. While it's typically recommended to gradually sprinkle in the sugar while beating, simply dumping it in was found to make no difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Similarly, using a double boiler isn't necessary; the sugar can be beaten into the eggs directly in the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Beat the sugar into the eggs until the mixture is glossy and the beaters leave defined trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Using more sugar than some recipes can result in a "cotton candy-ish melt-in-your-mouth texture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The ingredient proportions, including sugar, can be radically altered if one gives up on the idea of cosmetically "perfect" macarons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Almond Flour and Other Dry Ingredients

### Almond Flour
While it's possible to make almond flour by processing blanched almonds in a food processor, it can be difficult to achieve a fine enough consistency, leading to a gritty final cookie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It's often recommended to simply buy almond flour, looking for packages with a window to visually compare fineness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Almond flour is versatile and can be stored in the freezer indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

For the recipe, about three-quarters of a cup of almond flour is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. More almond flour would make the meringue taste more "cookie-ish," while less would make it more "candy-ish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Other Dry Ingredients
An equal quantity of powdered sugar (about three-quarters of a cup) is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Cocoa powder is also included, with about a quarter of a cup resulting in a very chocolatey flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Natural cocoa is used, but Dutch cocoa can be substituted for an "Oreo flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Sifting all the dry ingredients together is often recommended, but experiments showed it did "absolutely nothing noticeable" to the sugar or almond flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Sifting does break up chunks of cocoa powder, though having a few chunks in the finished macaron is not necessarily a "bad thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

For chocolate macarons, a few grains of salt are recommended to balance the sweetness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Salt could potentially affect egg chemistry, but a small amount is fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Mixing Dry Ingredients into Meringue
Traditionally, the dry ingredients are folded into the eggs in batches, but adding them all at once was found to work fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The mixture should initially feel "way too dry," but will come together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It's important to scrape down the sides of the bowl thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

This mixing phase is called "macaronage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The mixing can stop when the batter starts to look like a mousse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Over-mixing past this point will cause the mixture to loosen, resulting in a flatter, smoother macaron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The consistency can be tested by dropping a dollop off a spatula and observing how it spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Both thicker and looser batters can produce good results, and the speaker prefers the craggy tops from a thicker batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

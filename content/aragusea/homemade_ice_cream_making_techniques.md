This article details methods for making homemade ice cream without a dedicated ice cream maker, focusing on the [[two_bowls_method_for_making_ice_cream | two bowls method]]. This technique requires no special equipment and can yield several pints of ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Core Two Bowls Method

The [[two_bowls_method_for_making_ice_cream | two bowls method]] involves nesting a smaller bowl inside a larger one, with an ice and salt mixture in the outer bowl to create a supercooled environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Essential Equipment

*   **Large Outer Bowl:** A big 10-quart (9.5 liters) bowl is used, though the material doesn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. It should be at least twice as big as the inner bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Inner Bowl:** A 4-quart (just under 4 liters) metal bowl is recommended for its thermal conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Hand Mixer:** Used for beating the ice cream mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. A whisk can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Ice:** Regular ice cubes work fine, though some suggest crushed ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Salt:** Kosher salt is used, roughly one part salt to four parts ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Ice cream salt, while cheaper due to impurities, works similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Preparation Steps

1.  **Pre-chill Bowls and Ingredients:** Optionally, chill the bowls and ingredients in the freezer for 10-15 minutes before starting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  **Prepare Ice Bath:** Fill the outer bowl halfway with ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Stir in salt; the salt lowers the melting point of the ice, creating supercooled water around the inner bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
3.  **Nest Inner Bowl:** Place the inner bowl into the ice bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Churning Process

1.  **Phase One Beating:** Add ice cream mixture to the inner bowl and beat on the lowest setting for 8-10 minutes with a hand mixer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Work the edges to prevent mixture from sticking and freezing to the bowl walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The mixture will become fluffy, similar to whipped cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
2.  **First Freeze:** Once the mixture stops getting stiffer or colder, place the entire rig (or just the inner bowl, recharging the outer bowl with ice later) into the freezer for about an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
3.  **Phase Two Beating:** Remove from the freezer and beat again for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The mixture will deflate and begin to look like ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Scrape frozen bits off the walls to spread the cold evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This step helps pop excess air bubbles and break down large ice crystals for a smoother texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Stop when it starts to melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
4.  **Final Hardening:** Pour the ice cream into a lidded, freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 24 hours to harden properly and prevent quick melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Types of Homemade Ice Cream

### [[philadelphia_style_versus_french_style_ice_cream | Philadelphia Style Ice Cream]] (Sweet Cream)

This is the easiest and purest form, made without eggs or pre-cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

*   **Ingredients:**
    *   1 pint (2 cups / 475 ml) cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
    *   1 cup (235 ml) evaporated milk (recommended for smoother texture due to higher protein) or regular milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
    *   ¾ cup (150 grams) sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
    *   Vanilla (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   **Method:** Combine all ingredients in the inner bowl and proceed with the core [[two_bowls_method_for_making_ice_cream | two bowls method]] steps.

### [[philadelphia_style_versus_french_style_ice_cream | French Style Ice Cream]] (Frozen Custard)

This method involves cooking an egg yolk-based custard, making it more involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It results in a noticeably denser and smoother ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

*   **Ingredients:**
    *   6 egg yolks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
    *   ¾ cup sugar (split) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>
    *   1 pint cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>
    *   Pinch of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
    *   Vanilla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>
    *   1 cup cold regular milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>
*   **Custard [[cooking_techniques | Cooking]] Steps:**
    1.  Whisk half the sugar into the egg yolks to smooth them and prevent curdling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    2.  In a pot, combine remaining sugar, cream, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    3.  Slowly drizzle the simmering cream mixture into the egg yolks while whisking constantly to temper the eggs and prevent curdling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    4.  Return the mixture to the pot and simmer for a few more minutes until it thickens slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
    5.  Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and cold milk. Adding cold milk helps cool the custard faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    6.  Strain the custard into another bowl to remove any "chunkies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
    7.  Cool the custard completely before churning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This usually requires cooking many hours in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Churning:** Once cooled, proceed with the core [[two_bowls_method_for_making_ice_cream | two bowls method]] steps.

## [[incorporating_fruits_and_other_mixins_into_homemade_ice_cream | Incorporating Fruits and Other Mix-ins]]

Chunks, such as fruit or chocolate chips, should generally be added right at the end of the Phase Two beating, just before the final freeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This prevents interference with the freezing and aerating processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Fruit Preparation Example (Peaches)

1.  **Peel Peaches:** Peach skins can taste papery in ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
2.  **Chop and Sweeten:** Chop peaches into a coarse grind. Chunks larger than this can freeze solid and hard inside the ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Scatter with sugar and a little lime juice (the acid prevents browning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Let sit for about an hour for the sugar to break down the fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
3.  **Extract Juice:** Before churning, squeeze as much juice as possible from the fruit pulp into the ice cream mix. The ice cream needs to be churned with most of the water already inside it, otherwise the fruit juice could freeze hard and crunchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
4.  **Add Solids:** Stir the peach solids into the ice cream mixture after the second beating, just before transferring to the freezer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

French macarons are a beloved old-world pastry consisting of two almond meringue cookies sandwiching some kind of filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. They are delicious and naturally gluten-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. On a per-weight basis, they are often the most expensive dessert found in bakeries, making them a worthwhile endeavor to make at home despite their notoriously fussy reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Characteristics and Appearance
The classic macaron is characterized by perfectly smooth domes arching over little ruffled edges, adorably known as "macaron feet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. While many bakers strive for this pristine look, it's argued that macarons don't have to look perfect to taste good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. By letting go of precious expectations about appearance, macarons can become one of the easiest and cheapest, yet still delicious, desserts to make in a home kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Ingredients and Preparation Principles
Macarons are primarily made from egg whites, sugar, and [[Almond Flour and Meringue Ingredients | almond flour]]. While some recipes emphasize extreme precision, particularly weighing ingredients on a gram scale, the speaker suggests that flexibility in proportions can still yield delicious results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Radical alterations to sugar and almond quantities, for instance, can lead to different textures (e.g., more cookie-ish or candy-ish), but all batches can maintain basic structural integrity and be enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Meringue cookies are considered forgiving pastries if one is not overly concerned with aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

When making chocolate macarons, natural cocoa is used, but Dutch cocoa can provide an "Oreo flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. A small amount of salt can enhance chocolate macarons, though too much could affect egg chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The mixing phase, known as "macaronage" in French, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Stopping the mixing when the batter resembles a mousse yields craggier tops, while further mixing results in a looser batter and flatter, smoother macarons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The speaker prefers the craggy tops for their crispier and more caramelized texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Baking
A common technique is to let the piped macaron batter dry out for about half an hour before baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This passive step helps create a smoother surface and encourages the macaron to expand upward instead of outward in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. An oven temperature of 350°F (180°C) is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. While some methods suggest steam injection to prevent cracking, allowing them to crack can serve as an indicator that they are done, typically after about 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Filling and Enjoyment
After baking, macarons need to cool and solidify for a significant period before filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. A simple ganache made from equal parts cream and chocolate is a popular filling choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Dark chocolate can balance the sweetness of the meringue cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. When assembling, it's important not to overfill, as the meringue is insubstantial and can be easily overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Macarons are often ten times better the day after they are made, as the meringues absorb moisture from the filling and air, developing a chewy, marshmallow-like consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The big air pockets within the meringue are appreciated for how the layers collapse when bitten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Philosophy on "Perfection"
The speaker challenges the notion of a single "perfect" macaron, embracing the variety of a handcrafted product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. If factory perfection is desired, it can be purchased from a factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. It's encouraged for home bakers to critically think about what "perfect" means to them and to enjoy the variations that come with each batch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. For example, macarons made with less sugar can have a chewier, brownie-like consistency and pair well with marshmallow fluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

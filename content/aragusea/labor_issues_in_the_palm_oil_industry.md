The modern [[history_and_production_of_palm_oil | palm oil]] industry is significantly impacted by labor abuses and land issues, leading to its low cost but high human toll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Journalist Jocelyn Zuckerman's book "Planet Palm" highlights these issues, including "stolen land" and "slave labor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Exploitation of Migrant Workers

A major concern within the [[history_and_production_of_palm_oil | palm oil]] industry, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia, is the reliance on imported labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Malaysians often have a higher standard of living and are less interested in the manual labor jobs on plantations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. As a result, labor is often sourced from countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar, including Rohingya refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

These workers are frequently brought in under false pretenses; recruiters promise jobs in restaurants or hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Instead, they are trafficked to plantations, often having their passports confiscated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. They are then forced to work to pay off the wages recruiters claimed in advance, leaving them stranded on plantations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Some workers have resorted to making escapes under the cover of night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Land Dispossession and Community Impact

The industry also faces accusations of "stolen land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. In Liberia, for example, the government rents jungle land to large companies to establish [[history_and_production_of_palm_oil | palm oil]] operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This land, while not inhabited by people living a modern developed economy lifestyle, is home to traditional communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. These communities are often less equipped to assert their rights and receive minimal compensation for their displacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

As a result, they lose their land for farming and living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Additionally, their rivers can become poisoned due to agrichemicals used on the plantations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Governments often side with the companies, driven by perceived poverty alleviation schemes and, frequently, corruption where officials are paid by the companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Dangerous Working Conditions and Low Wages

In Central America, workers on [[history_and_production_of_palm_oil | palm oil]] plantations are fighting to unionize to improve horrific working conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. These dangers include snake bites, falls, and exposure to agrichemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Despite working long hours, often six days a week, they receive pitiful wages, making it impossible to support their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

The concentration of the [[history_and_production_of_palm_oil | palm oil]] industry in equatorial nations, coupled with their unique economic and political histories, makes this crop a significant source of these labor abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## Challenges in Tracing and Certification

While some countries, like the United States, have banned imports or sanctioned certain [[history_and_production_of_palm_oil | palm oil]] producers due to these abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, tracing the origin of oil is difficult once it's blended in the international commodities market and refining processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Certification schemes like the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) aim to ensure more ethical practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. However, workers on plantations in Honduras reported being coached with scripts to give positive accounts of their working conditions to RSPO investigators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Those who did not follow the script were punished or fired, while compliant workers were rewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. While some small-holder farms, like those in Ecuador working with Natural Habitats, demonstrate sustainable practices, they represent a tiny portion of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Broader Context for [[consumer_challenges_and_sustainable_alternatives_for_palm_oil | Consumers]]

The issues within the [[history_and_production_of_palm_oil | palm oil]] industry highlight a broader problem where consumer guilt might be misdirected at single products or companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Many believe that the solution is not merely to "consume our way out" of the problem, but to consume less overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

[[what_is_malt | Malt]] is a complex ingredient, defined simply as any cereal grain that has been allowed to germinate or sprout, meaning it has begun growing into a new plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. A grain is the seed of a grass plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Sprouted grain is particularly nutritious and can be consumed raw or cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For a brief period, sprouted grain is rich in [[enzymes_and_malting_process | enzymes]], which enable the creation of various foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Historical Context

It is theorized that ancient humans first discovered malting by soaking dried grains in water to soften them for chewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The grains would then sprout, and people gradually recognized the beneficial properties of sprouted grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Malting Process

The process of malting involves tricking viable, dormant grain into germinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

1.  **Grain Selection**: The primary requirement is intact, whole grain that has been dried into dormancy but remains viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. While wheat can be malted, barley is the most common grain for malt production due to its lower gluten content and ease of cultivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Other grains like rice, rye, oats, and corn can also be malted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
2.  **Washing (Steeping)**: Grains are washed to remove debris and dead seeds (which float) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This step also helps wash away microorganisms that could cause spoilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The grains are then submerged in water, ideally in a cool environment, for approximately a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This soaking initiates the malting process by bringing the seed to just under 50% hydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
3.  **Germination**: After soaking, the water is drained, and the grains are spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The goal is to mimic a cool spring rain, prompting the seeds to sprout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This process is repeated over several days, with occasional spritzing of water and frequent turning to ensure air access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   **Indicators of Germination**: Small white tendrils, called rootlets, emerge first, aiming for the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Subsequently, the acrospire (or plumule) appears, which is the above-ground part of the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. For wheat, the acrospire grows externally, but for other grains, it may grow entirely inside the seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   **Stopping Point**: The germination process is halted when the acrospire is nearly as long as the seed itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This timing is crucial because the goal is to develop a significant amount of active [[enzymes_and_malting_process | amylase enzymes]] within the seed without consuming all of its starch reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### The Role of Enzymes

When water enters the seed, it activates proteins, causing the cells to "come to life" and produce enzymes, specifically amylase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Amylase is an enzyme that catalyzes a biological process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
The seed produces amylase to transform the starch within the seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Starch molecules are large, branched chains of thousands of sugars that serve as food for the growing plant until it can perform photosynthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The young plant, however, cannot consume these complex starch polymers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Therefore, the amylase enzyme breaks down these starches into smaller, simpler sugars, most notably maltose (a disaccharide of two glucose units), which the plant can use for cellular respiration and energy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Kilning and Drying

After germination, the sprouted grains are dried, or "kilned," to halt the plant's growth and preserve the accumulated enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
Traditional methods in Scotland involve drying malt on a perforated floor with hot air generated by burning peat, which imparts a smoky flavor to some [[types_of_malt_and_their_uses | malts]] used in scotch whisky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. For home production, an oven on its lowest setting with the door cracked can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Base Malts and Enzyme Preservation

To produce a "base malt," the drying process is slow and at lower temperatures to avoid denaturing the [[enzymes_and_malting_process | enzymes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Enzymes, being proteins, begin to cook and deactivate above 149째F (65째C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Rapid denaturation occurs above 180째F (85째C), rendering the amylase incapable of converting starches into sugars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The effectiveness of a malt in converting starch to sugar is measured by its "diastatic power," which indicates the percentage of remaining active amylase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Base malts have a high diastatic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Flavor and Color Development

Beyond drying, malts can be roasted at higher temperatures to develop various flavors and colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. High heat facilitates browning reactions between proteins and sugars, creating unique flavor compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   Lighter roasted malts can taste like milkshake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   Super dark roasted malts may taste like cocoa powder or coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   These dark roasted malts have minimal enzymatic power and are primarily used for flavor and color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Uses of Malt

The [[types_of_malt_and_their_uses | properties of malt]] make it invaluable in various industries:

*   **Baking**: Bakers use amylase from [[what_is_malt | malt]] to provide fermentable sugars for yeast, which in turn produces carbon dioxide to raise bread dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Many bread flours include added [[malt_in_beverages_and_baked_goods | malt flour]] or enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Non-diastatic malt powder, rich in maltose, also contributes to desirable browning of bread crusts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Brewing and Distilling**: Brewers and distillers use amylase to convert grain starches into sugars that yeast can consume to produce alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
    *   Grains, including base malt, are crushed and steeped in water to create a "mash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
    *   The amylase breaks down starch into sugars, forming a sweet liquid called "wort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   Barley is favored for brewing because its low gluten content allows the wort to drain cleanly from the grain mash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
    *   Yeast is added to the wort, consuming the sugars and producing alcohol and carbon dioxide, which are the basis for beer or spirits like whiskey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Malt Syrup**: If wort is boiled down instead of fermented, it yields [[malt_in_beverages_and_baked_goods | malt syrup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This non-diastatic syrup is used to impart specific malty flavor and color to baked goods such as New York-style bagels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Malted Milk**: In the late 19th century, James Horlick created "malted milk" by combining [[what_is_malt | malt powder]] with milk powder and wheat flour to make an easily digestible, shelf-stable drink mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. It became popular as an energy drink and in milkshakes, often with chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. When baked into hard biscuits and coated in chocolate, it forms [[malt_in_beverages_and_baked_goods | malted milk balls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

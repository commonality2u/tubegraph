Pot roast offers significant value, providing a monarch's meal that is both inexpensive and easy to prepare, primarily requiring time and minimal attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This version aims for deep and complex flavors by strategically removing the lid during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Equipment and Setup
A large Dutch oven with a lid is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The oven should be preheated to 350°F (approximately 180°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Choosing and Preparing the Meat
The classic choice for pot roast is a thick steak of beef chuck, which is beef shoulder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. A size of two and a half to three pounds is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Chuck is tough but contains lots of collagen that melts when slow-cooked, becoming unctuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It also has a near-perfect amount of fat for [[braising_methods_for_beef | braising]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Fat Trimming
To limit melted fat in the finished gravy, it's easier to remove some fat at the initial stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Chuck roasts often have a large, concentrated nut of fat in the middle that can be cut out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Since the finished sauce will be very viscous, skimming fat off at the end is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Don't worry about mangling the meat, as it will be torn into chunks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. There will still be plenty of fat remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Browning the Meat
Use a tiny amount of oil in the pan, just enough to start the meat, as it will quickly render its own fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Seasoning the meat beforehand is considered unnecessary because it will be completely covered in sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Many recipes advise browning meat for braises on high heat, but this is generally considered bad advice unless the pan is extremely crowded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. A better finished product is achieved by taking it easy on medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Burned flavors created on the bottom of the pan will spoil the sauce later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The meat will brown on medium heat; it just needs time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. If any exposed surface of the pan looks like it will burn, move the meat to cover that part to divert heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Once the meat can be peeled off the surface without sticking too hard, it's ready to flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. If the fond (meat drippings) starts to burn, remove the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Building the Sauce and Adding Aromatics
While the meat browns, chop a large onion into thin quarter circles, which can act as a structural mesh in the finished gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. A stick of celery can also be added, cut into very small pieces if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Add the onion and celery to the pan for a head start; they don't need to be fully soft as they will cook for hours with the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

If the fond is close to burning, add a large squeeze of tomato paste and up to a quarter cup of flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Stir well to disperse the flour granules in the fats and to allow the tomato paste to brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Browned tomato paste adds incredible depth and intensity to stews and sauces, even those not intended to be overtly tomato-flavored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

When ingredients are about to burn, deglaze the pan with a couple of cups of red wine, up to half a bottle, scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. While white wine can be used for braised beef, the combination of red wine and tomato is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Add a 28-ounce can of quality crushed tomatoes, scraping the bottom clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Less or no tomato can be used if a non-tomatoey pot roast is preferred, using beef stock instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. A generous amount of Worcestershire sauce will impart a meaty flavor, or soy sauce can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Lots of garlic powder is perfect here, as it brings tons of umami when rehydrated in the sauce, and is more convenient than fresh garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Add a little pepper, or save it for the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Return the floppy mass of meat and any juices back into the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Give it a gentle mix to coat the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Although the liquid may appear too thick, a significant amount of water will be released from the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Cooking Process

### Initial Braising
Place the lid on the Dutch oven and put it into the preheated oven at 350°F (180°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Side Dish Preparation
While the pot roast cooks, five russet or large Yukon Gold potatoes (or a mixture) can be cooked separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Let them cook until easily pierced with a fork, approximately an hour and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

#### Mashed Baked Potatoes
To make mashed baked potatoes, melt a 7-ounce package (almost two sticks) of butter in a pan on medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Peel and chop about half a head of garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. French cultured butter adds a desirable tang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Add the garlic to the melted butter, stir, and turn off the heat, allowing it to cook gently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Ensure nothing turns dark brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

Using a ricer, scoop the flesh out of the cooled baked potatoes and extrude it directly into the butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. A ricer yields the smoothest texture for mashed baked potatoes, as whipping doesn't work well due to the stiff flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. For a rustic texture, the flesh can be crushed with a fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

Add a big pinch of salt, a generous amount of milk, and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Stir to homogenize the texture as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. More milk can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Heating the milk beforehand is not found to make a noticeable difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. These potatoes will not be as smooth as boiled mashed potatoes, but the higher temperature in the oven gives them a more intense, caramelized flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Boiling water limits the temperature to 212°F (100°C), preventing brown flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Cover and keep warm until serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Incorporating Carrots and Final Uncovered Cooking
After about two and a half hours, check the meat for tenderness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Chuck can be variable, but for a melt-in-your-mouth stage, it might need another hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

For carrots, peel about a pound, seeking big ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. To achieve evenly cooked, al dente carrots, cut them into pieces of roughly equal mass, despite varying girth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This means longer pieces near the tip and progressively shorter pieces towards the stem end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Remember they will shrink, so cut them larger than desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

Once the meat is basically done, add the carrots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Get them wet in the sauce, but do not submerge them, as they benefit from dry heat exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. An absolute game-changer for pot roast is to cook it uncovered for the last hour or so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The sauce might appear too thick, but the carrots will release a lot of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Don't worry if some residue around the rim burns; the goal is to brown the top of the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

After about an hour uncovered, the carrots should be just tender enough to pierce with a fork, offering an al dente contrast to the jello-soft meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Total cooking time for the roast should be three and a half to four hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The browned top on the meat provides incredible flavor and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Finishing and Serving
Pick rosemary off the stems and chop it while waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

### Last-Minute Flavorings
Add a pinch of salt (the only salt so far might be from Worcestershire sauce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Finish long-stewed dishes with a shot of vinegar, such as balsamic, to "wake things up" as long-cooked flavors can be delicious but a little dull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Add fresh pepper and the chopped rosemary, which will stay green when added at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Pulling the Meat
For a pulled texture, the meat is so tender it can fall apart from stirring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Stir first to incorporate flavorings, then pull any remaining large chunks into bite-sized pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Avoid over-agitating to prevent it from shredding into an undesirable texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Dissolve any burned edges into the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Serving
Serve a large pile of mashed potatoes on the plate; they are perfect for soaking up extra sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Then add the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Considerations for Vegetables
While people sometimes put multiple kinds of vegetables or even potatoes in their pot roast, keeping to one main vegetable ensures it receives the perfect amount of cooking time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Cooking multiple vegetables at once can lead to some becoming mushy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

The meat should be covered in melted collagen and fat, resulting in a lip-smacking experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The long, partially dry [[cooking_techniques | cooking]] transforms the sauce from looking like tomato sauce into something much darker and sweeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Pot roast reheats well, and there should be plenty leftover to serve many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

Panko is a type of breadcrumb that originated in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Even when ground into tiny bits, it fries up significantly crispier than other breadcrumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This superior crispiness is attributed to its unique microstructure, which is a result of the peculiar way its bread is baked using electrical current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Key Characteristics for Commercial Use

Panko's baking process results in bread that has:
*   **No Crust** When baked with electrical current from the inside out, the bread for panko lacks a crust, giving it a totally uniform color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This contrasts with normal breadcrumbs, which often contain bits of caramelized crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Neutral Flavor** Due to the lack of crust, panko offers a more neutral flavor, acting as a "blank canvas" for the cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Light, Airy Crumb** Baking with electrical current from the inside out creates an extremely light and airy crumb structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This airy structure makes panko "crispy" (brittle and airy) rather than just "crunchy" (hard and brittle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **High Absorbency** The microstructure of panko makes it more absorbent than western-style breadcrumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. While this means it absorbs oil when frying, the oil then drains out easily, leading to a less greasy, lighter, and crispier product that stays crispy longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This airiness allows panko to be both more absorbent and crispier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Panko in the Commercial Market

### Manufacturing and Distribution
[[Manufacturing process of panko | Panko's manufacturing process]] involves baking bread using an electrical current, where metal plates conduct electricity through the dough. The dough's resistance creates heat, steam-cooking the bread from the inside out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Once enough water evaporates, the electric flow stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Upper Crust Enterprises, a panko manufacturer in Los Angeles, is one such producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The company was founded by Gary Kawaguchi's father, who initially started making panko in the US for his own fish fry business because he had to import real panko from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Once he began production, Japanese chefs and other commercial food businesses became customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Currently, Upper Crust Enterprises sells exclusively to other businesses, such as restaurants and commercial food businesses; their product is not available in retail stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. They can supply panko ground to any desired fineness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Product Shapes and Pricing
The traditional panko shape consists of long, jagged "shards" or "slivers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Achieving this sliver shape depends on the baking and fermentation processes, which allow gluten fibers to lengthen naturally, causing the bread to flake into slivers when ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

This specific sliver shape is more expensive to produce due to the need for more delicate machining and packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Even cheaper panko varieties tend to be slightly more expensive than other types of breadcrumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Culinary Applications in the Market
[[Culinary applications and advantages of panko | Panko is valued for its versatility]] in various dishes:
*   **Binding Agent** Chefs frequently use panko as a binder in mixtures like meatballs or [[burger ingredients | salmon burgers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Its absorbency allows for effective binding with less bread, preserving the flavor of the primary ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Breading** The traditional panko shape is essential for dishes like Japanese-style breaded shrimp or chicken katsu (a Japanese chicken [[Breading techniques and variations for schnitzel | schnitzel]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Its ability to remain crispy even when ground into a powder makes it a foolproof choice for achieving crispiness every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

Despite its slightly higher cost compared to other breadcrumbs, panko's unique properties, such as its exceptional crispiness, neutral flavor, and efficient oil drainage, make it a preferred choice for many commercial kitchens and chefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

Mushrooms, often compared to bread due to their structure, are composed of a fibrous network that encloses water and mostly air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This foamy structure, though finer and harder to see than in bread, consists of tiny air pockets within a seemingly solid mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The entire mushroom is made of densely interwoven hyphae, or little threads, which create significant empty space between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Impact of Cooking Methods on Texture

The choice of cooking method significantly influences the final texture of mushrooms.

### The [[conventional_method_of_cooking_mushrooms_with_oil | Conventional Method with Oil]]

When using oil, mushrooms initially brown nicely, but their spongy structure quickly absorbs the oil, making the pan feel dry and tempting cooks to add more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. As cooking progresses, the hyphae network starts to break down and collapse as cells rupture, causing water to spill out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This release of water into the hot oil leads to spitting and makes a mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Additionally, a pan crowded with mushrooms will be flooded with water, causing the temperature to plummet and preventing browning until all the water evaporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

To achieve a desirable texture with the [[conventional_method_of_cooking_mushrooms_with_oil | conventional method]], it is recommended to start with high heat to get color on the mushrooms before the water comes out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. The speaker usually cooks them until they've shrunk by about half, finding that this retains some internal cavities and results in a more pleasant texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### The [[wet_method_of_cooking_mushrooms | Wet Method with Water]]

The [[wet_method_of_cooking_mushrooms | water trick]] involves cooking mushrooms in a thin film of water, using it as a thermal interface instead of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This method prevents sticking and cooks mushrooms down quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. However, water can only reach 100 degrees Celsius before evaporating, which is not hot enough for browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Therefore, mushrooms are cooked until their spongy hyphae structure has collapsed and most of their water has evaporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Only after evaporation can a little oil be added for browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

While less messy due to the absence of the "spitting stage," the [[wet_method_of_cooking_mushrooms | water trick]] often results in a leathery texture because the mushrooms tend to be overcooked to evaporate all the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This method typically causes the internal cavities to fully collapse, leading to an unpleasantly dense texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### The "Overcooking" Myth

There is a [[culinary_myths_about_cooking_mushrooms | culinary myth]] that mushrooms cannot be overcooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. While plant cell walls, reinforced with pectin, break down during cooking and can result in mushy textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, fungi like mushrooms have cell walls reinforced with chitin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Chitin is a more stable polymer at high temperatures and does not break down as much, meaning mushrooms don't easily turn into mush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. However, it is possible to fully collapse their hyphae structure, which can make them unpleasantly dense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Evidence of Textural Differences

A raw mushroom slice floats in water due to its tiny airy cavities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   A mushroom slice cooked using the [[conventional_method_of_cooking_mushrooms_with_oil | conventional method]] (sautéed in oil) will not float but also will not plummet quickly, indicating some air remains within its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Conversely, a mushroom slice cooked first in water and then browned in oil (the [[wet_method_of_cooking_mushrooms | water trick]]) sinks like a stone, suggesting its internal cavities have fully collapsed due to the extensive cooking required to evaporate the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Oil Absorption and Release

While it's often believed that conventionally sautéed mushrooms absorb excessive oil, mushrooms do squeeze some of the absorbed oil back out as they cook and shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Resisting the temptation to add more oil can result in the pan feeling greasy again as the oil pushes back out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

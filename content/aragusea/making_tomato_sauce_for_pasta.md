From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

This recipe for spaghetti and meatballs features an efficient and flavorful approach to making tomato sauce, departing from traditional, longer methods to create a "quick cooked sauce" with a brighter taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51">[06:51]</a>. The sauce is designed to be made in the same pan as the meatballs, leveraging their flavors for depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20">[04:20]</a>.

## Ingredients for the Sauce

The sauce primarily uses:
*   Tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25">[04:25]</a>
*   High-quality 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes (about 800 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32">[04:32]</a>

## Sauce Preparation

1.  **Start with Tomato Paste** A big squeeze of tomato paste is added to the pan after browning the meatballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25">[04:25]</a>. This ingredient provides "incredible instant depth to a [[making_quick_tomato_sauce | quick tomato sauce]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26">[04:26]</a>.
2.  **Fry the Paste** Allow the tomato paste to fry for a second before it burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30">[04:30]</a>.
3.  **Add Crushed Tomatoes** Pour in a high-quality 28-ounce can of crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32">[04:32]</a>.
4.  **Deglaze the Pan** Deglaze the bottom of the pan thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">[04:37]</a>. The dissolved meatball fond and rendered beef fat are considered sufficient additional flavoring for the tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50">[04:50]</a>.
5.  **Stir Frequently** The sauce needs to be stirred frequently to prevent sticking and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24">[05:24]</a>.

## Cooking Method

The speaker prefers to make the sauce and brown the meatballs all in one pan, believing it yields "amazing flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47">[04:47]</a>. This contrasts with a traditional approach where grandma made her sauce in a separate pot and transferred fried meatballs to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41">[04:41]</a>.

Using a small quantity of tomatoes in a wide pan allows for very fast reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56">[04:56]</a>. This sauce can be done in the time it takes to boil spaghetti, roughly ten minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05">[05:05]</a>.

### Pan Choice
While a well-seasoned cast-iron pan or a Teflon pan is best for browning meatballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43">[04:43]</a>, the sauce can also be made in a cast-iron pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27">[05:27]</a>. The speaker notes that it takes a long time for a noticeable amount of iron to leach into the sauce, especially for a sauce that's done in ten minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>.

## Sauce Texture

The speaker prefers a "very tight texture on tomato sauce for pasta," contrasting with grandma's "super watery" sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00">[05:00]</a>. This tight texture is achieved through rapid reduction in a wide pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58">[04:58]</a>.

## Finishing and Serving the Sauce

1.  **Cheese and Herbs** When the pasta is almost ready, turn off the heat for the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37">[05:37]</a>. Mix some grated cheese (pecorino or Parmesan) and fresh herbs (parsley was used) directly into the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40">[05:40]</a>.
2.  **Seasoning** Taste the sauce for seasoning after adding the cheese, as the cheese contributes additional salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49">[05:49]</a>.
3.  **Saucing the Pasta** For a tighter sauce consistency, drain the pasta well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54">[05:54]</a>. To control the amount of sauce on the pasta, add the sauce to the pasta pot rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59">[05:59]</a>.
    *   **Serving Style** The speaker prefers to "under-sauce" the spaghetti in the pot, then serve it on a plate and scoop a little more sauce on top with additional meatballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17">[06:17]</a>. This maintains some "heterogeneity or layering of textures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15">[06:15]</a>, contrasting with the method of pouring sauce directly onto dry pasta on the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08">[06:08]</a>.
4.  **Garnishing** When garnishing, the speaker puts parsley or basil on first, then the cheese on top, as they like how the cheese "stays white and looks like fresh fallen snow on the leaves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28">[06:28]</a>.

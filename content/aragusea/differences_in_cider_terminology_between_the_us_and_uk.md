From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

In most English-speaking countries, including the United Kingdom, "cider" refers to a delightful, relatively low-alcohol, fizzy drink made from apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, in the United States, the terminology for apple-based beverages differs significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## US Terminology
In the United States:
*   **Cider** refers to an unalcoholic, non-fizzy drink made from apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This is typically unfiltered or cloudy apple juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Hard Cider** is the term used for the fizzy, alcoholic apple drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This sector has been the fastest-growing segment of the US alcohol market for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Apple Juice** refers to highly filtered and refined apple juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

This distinction is largely unique to American English, with the possible exception of some Canadians under US influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. British English, conversely, distinguishes between "clear apple juice" and "cloudy apple juice" for non-alcoholic versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Historical Meaning of "Cider"
The term "cider" and its etymological roots have historically always referred to an alcoholic beverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Tracing back to the Hebrew word *shekhar* (strong drink/intoxicant) from Leviticus 10:8, it evolved through Latin (*sikara*), Italian (*cedro*), Spanish (*sidra*), Old French (*cistre* or *sidre*), and finally became "cider" in English after the Normans brought it to England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Historically, unfermented apple juice was not commonly described with a specific term in Middle English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The Oxford English Dictionary's first record of "apple juice" is from early modern English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Natural Fermentation and Safety
Apple juice is naturally prone to becoming alcoholic due to yeast on the apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. If unwashed apples are pressed into juice and not boiled or pasteurized, they will likely become a weak alcoholic beverage within a couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Historically, allowing fermentation made the drink safer, as the alcohol could control potentially harmful bacteria, offering a nutritious and tastier alternative to often questionable local water supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This low-alcohol beverage was even given to children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Apples for Cider
[[the_process_of_making_alcoholic_and_nonalcoholic_cider | Alcoholic ciders]] are generally made with apples that are not ideal for eating, often being harsh or astringent due to high tannin content. These qualities, however, provide depth and body to the fermented cider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Historically, English colonists in New England planted both "dessert apples" (for eating) and "cider apples" (for juicing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Cider in Colonial America
When English colonists arrived in New England, they found a climate highly suitable for orchards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Alcoholic apple cider quickly became a staple of Anglo-American colonial homesteads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The term "alcoholic apple cider" would have been redundant to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Cider was given to children, used to make [[different_types_of_vinegar_and_aging | apple cider vinegar]] (essential for food preservation and cleaning), and converted into stronger drinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. One such stronger drink was **applejack**, made by freeze-distilling cider during frigid New England winters. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, but ethanol requires much colder temperatures, leading to a higher concentration of alcohol in the unfrozen liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## The [[impact_of_prohibition_on_the_cider_industry_in_the_us | Impact of Prohibition]]
The temperance movement, particularly fervent among descendants of English Puritans, led to Prohibition in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. While the beer industry survived Prohibition, the hard cider industry in the US was completely wiped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

From the ashes of the defunct cider industry emerged new products:
*   **Sweet cider**: Unfermented apple juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Apple juice**: A new product resulting from the industrialization of America's food system, which was highly filtered and refined cider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

To distinguish between the two, people began calling the cloudy, unfiltered version "cider" and the clear, industrial product "apple juice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This shift occurred because, by then, there was virtually no alcoholic cider commercially available in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## The Origin of "Hard Cider"
When Americans eventually rediscovered and began commercially producing alcoholic cider again, they needed a way to differentiate it from the sweet, non-alcoholic "cider" that had become common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Thus, the term "hard cider" was adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

The convention of calling alcoholic beverages "hard" and non-alcoholic ones "soft" is a unique feature of American English, with examples dating back to the colonial period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This likely descended from an older British English feature where harsh-tasting drinks were described as "hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The inherent harsh taste of alcohol, or perhaps the less refined alcoholic beverages produced in the US at the time, may have led Americans to adopt this distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

> [!info] The word "apple"
> Historically, the word "apple" in English and many Indo-European languages was a generic term for almost any fruit, specifically any edible, bulbous growth on a plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This explains why the French refer to potatoes as *pomme de terre* (apple of the earth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The term *malus domestica* (the apple species we know today) has been popular in Britain since at least Roman times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The wild ancestor of the apple is native to Central Asia, with Alma-Ata (Almaty) meaning "appletown" in Kazakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Romans spread domesticated varieties, and subsequent Germanic and French-speaking Norman settlers further propagated them in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The term "pomme" was also used for apples in English well into the modern period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

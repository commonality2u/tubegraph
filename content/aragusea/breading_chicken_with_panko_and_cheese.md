Breading chicken with panko and cheese is a key step in creating a crispy, flavorful [[crispy_chicken_parm_recipe | crispy chicken parm recipe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This method integrates cheese directly into the breading mixture, rather than as a top layer, to ensure a crispy surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Chicken Preparation

Before breading, chicken breasts should be prepared to ensure even cooking and tenderization:
*   **Halving** Chicken breasts are typically too thick for this dish, so they should be cut in half horizontally to create thinner cutlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
*   **Pounding** Use a meat mallet, heavy glass, or a spiked tool to pound the chicken cutlets thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This also helps to [[techniques_for_tenderizing_chicken | tenderize the meat]] and create holes for marinade absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Seasoning and Marinating** It is recommended to [[seasoning_and_dry_curing_chicken | season the meat directly]] with salt and pepper rather than the breading for easier portion control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Marinate the seasoned chicken in a bowl with chopped garlic and a splash of white wine, then refrigerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Drying** Before applying the breading, pat the chicken dry with paper towels to prevent a gooey breading texture <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Breading Process

The breading process involves three main stages:
1.  **Flour** First, coat the chicken in flour, as flour adheres well to meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
2.  **Egg** Next, dip the floured chicken into a well-beaten egg, as egg sticks to flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
3.  **Panko and Cheese** Finally, coat the chicken in the panko and cheese mixture, as breadcrumbs stick to egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Ensure the chicken is heavily coated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Panko Preparation
[[Origin story and invention of panko | Panko]], a type of Japanese breadcrumb, is uniquely made by electrocuting bread dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. It is known for its exceptional crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For this recipe, about half a cup of panko per piece of chicken is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Because the flakes can be large and jagged, it's beneficial to lightly grind them down with your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Incorporating Cheese
Grate a generous amount of hard cheese, such as Parmesan or Pecorino, directly onto the panko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The amount of cheese can be almost as much as the panko itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. All the cheese is mixed into the breading and fried, which eliminates the need for a separate layer of melted cheese on top, thus preserving the crispiness of the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The saltiness of the Pecorino also seasons the breading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Frying and Serving

*   **Frying** Heat a heavy coating of olive oil in a pan. Lay the breaded chicken into the pan, aiming for a gentle sizzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Be mindful of the heat, as the cheese in the breading can burn easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Flip the chicken when it turns golden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Thinner chicken pieces typically cook through by the time both sides have a golden crust, usually in about six minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Draining** After frying, drain the chicken on a cooling rack instead of paper towels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This allows air circulation, keeping the breading crispier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Serving to Maintain Crispiness** To retain crunch, serve the chicken without pouring sauce directly over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Instead, put the sauce on the plate around the chicken, allowing most of the chicken to remain dry and crispy until eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The white wine marinade contributes to a sweet and bright flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

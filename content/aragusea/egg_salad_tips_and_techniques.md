"Salad" in the context of egg salad, tuna salad, and chicken salad refers to a chopped, cold protein bound in a creamy base (usually mayonnaise), flavored with other ingredients, and often eaten as a sandwich filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These "salads" are excellent for mixing in advance and eating for lunch over several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Preparing the Hard-Boiled Eggs

For [[tuna_salad_preparation_and_variations | egg salad]], a whole dozen eggs are typically used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### [[cooking_tips_for_hardboiled_eggs_and_salad_texture | Boiling Eggs]]
*   **Water Additives**: Some people suggest adding vinegar or salt to the boiling water to make the shell easier to peel, but this has not been found to make a noticeable difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Starting Temperature**: Dropping eggs into already boiling water seems to help the white pull away from the shell more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. If an egg cracks, simply cover the pot to bring it back to a boil quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Cooking Time**: A chef friend recommends 14 minutes as the ideal time for hard-boiled eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### [[cooking_tips_for_hardboiled_eggs_and_salad_texture | Cooling Eggs]]
Instead of an ice water bath, an easier option is to drain the eggs through the pot lid, place the pot in the sink, and spray them with cool water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The constant replacement of water will cool them off quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### [[cracking_eggs_and_understanding_freshness_indicators | Peeling Eggs]]
One effective method for peeling eggs involves:
1.  Smacking the egg all over with the back of a spoon, focusing on the bottom where there's often a hollow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
2.  Flipping the spoon around and pushing its edge under the shell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
3.  Rinsing each egg after peeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
Since the eggs will be chopped for egg salad, it doesn't matter if small pieces are taken out of the side during peeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Assembling the Egg Salad

### Yolk Mixture
The approach for [[tuna_salad_preparation_and_variations | egg salad]] can be inspired by deviled eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
1.  Slice the hard-boiled eggs in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
2.  Push all the cooked yolks into a bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
3.  Smash the yolks smooth with mayonnaise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. While nearly equal parts mayo and egg yolk may be needed, it's wise to start conservatively as more can always be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Seasonings
*   **Sweet Pickle Relish**: A significant amount of sweet pickle relish, especially common in the South, greatly enhances the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Mustard**: A "sinus-clearing quantity" of mustard is also great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Salt and Pepper**: Add a little salt and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The yolk mixture needs to be strong enough to flavor the bland egg whites, so it should taste almost "too strong" on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Adding Whites and Crunchy Elements
Instead of piping the yolk filling back into egg halves (as for deviled eggs), it's much simpler to dice the egg whites and dump them into the yellow mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **Crunch Factor**: To contrast the soft and mushy texture of an egg salad sandwich, it's desirable to include crunchy ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
    *   **Onion/Shallot**: Fresh onion or coarsely chopped shallots provide excellent crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The onion flavor will mellow as the salad sits in the fridge, so it's advisable to "overshoot" the amount initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   **Celery/Cucumber**: While celery is a traditional addition, cucumber can be used as a substitute if preferred, offering a mild taste and plenty of fresh, watery crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Leaving some peel on the cucumber adds color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Cutting cucumber into triangular, thin slices with radial cuts ensures wide, crunchy pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Moisture Adjustment
If using cucumber, it will release some water overnight in the fridge, so it's wise to slightly "undershoot" the moisture (mayonnaise) when initially mixing the salad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Serving Suggestions
*   **Bread**: Lightly toasting the bread adds a contrasting texture without being so rigid that it squishes the salad out of the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Egg salad is often easier to eat on small rolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Make-Ahead**: Egg salad is a great dish to prepare in advance for lunches over several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

While [[benefits_and_challenges_of_using_a_cast_iron_skillet | cast iron pans]] come with certain [[drawbacks_of_cast_iron_pans | drawbacks]], they possess two primary virtues that explain their enduring popularity: their affordability for high quality and their ability to become non-stick through seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Cost-Effectiveness and Durability
[[comparison_of_cast_iron_with_other_cookware_materials | Cast iron]] is the least expensive way to create a thick, heavy, and high-quality pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For example, a highly-rated 12-inch [[benefits_and_challenges_of_using_a_cast_iron_skillet | cast iron pan]] from Victoria Cookware costs around $30, whereas a comparable 12-inch stainless steel pan can cost about $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

The cost difference stems from the manufacturing process:
*   **Casting**: Iron is melted and poured into sand molds, which is a simpler and more cost-effective method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This allows for complex geometries, integrated handles, and varying thicknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Stamping**: Stainless steel pans are typically made by stamping out thin sheets of steel, which then need to be layered and bolted together to achieve thickness and handle attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Steel also requires higher temperatures to melt and doesn't flow as well as iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Cast iron's integrated, one-piece design, created through casting in three-dimensional molds, makes it far more durable than cookware with bolted-on handles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This durability means that [[history_of_cast_iron_cookware | cast iron pans]] can last for generations, with many people still cooking on pans that are a hundred years old or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Superior Thermal Mass and Even Cooking
The thickness of [[benefits_and_challenges_of_using_a_cast_iron_skillet | cast iron pans]] gives them significant thermal mass, allowing them to absorb and store a large amount of heat from the burner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This offers several cooking advantages:
*   **Consistent Heat**: Unlike thin pans that lose heat quickly when food is added, a thick, heavy [[benefits_and_challenges_of_using_a_cast_iron_skillet | cast iron pan]] heats up and cools down slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This acts as a regulator, cooking food more evenly and ensuring a better crust when searing meats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Versatility with Heat Sources**:
    *   **Natural Fires**: Ideal for unpredictable heat sources like natural fires, which are difficult to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This makes [[benefits_and_challenges_of_using_a_cast_iron_skillet | cast iron]] a favorite among campers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    *   **Electric Burners**: Excellent for electric burners that cycle on and off, preventing sudden heat spikes that can burn food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Induction Compatibility**: Iron is magnetic, making it highly effective on induction burners, unlike aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Non-Stick Properties Through Seasoning
One of the key virtues of [[benefits_and_challenges_of_using_a_cast_iron_skillet | cast iron cookware]] is its ability to become non-stick through a process called [[maintenance_and_seasoning_of_cast_iron_pans | seasoning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### What is Seasoning?
Seasoning involves rubbing a thin layer of oil onto the pan and then burning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This causes the oil to break down and polymerize, similar to how plastics are made, creating a hard, glassy surface called a patina that is almost as non-stick as Teflon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

For those concerned about the environmental hazards of Teflon production, [[benefits_and_challenges_of_using_a_cast_iron_skillet | cast iron]] offers a viable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Most manufacturers now pre-season their pans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, but building up multiple thin layers at home is necessary for a truly effective non-stick surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Thick layers of oil during seasoning can result in a burnt crust that chips off or a sticky, gunky surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Recommended Oils for Seasoning
Different oils can be used for [[maintenance_and_seasoning_of_cast_iron_pans | seasoning]]. Flaxseed oil is favored by some, including Victoria Cookware, because its high alpha-linoleic acid content promotes excellent polymerization, creating a harder patina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. However, any edible oil with unsaturated fat can work, and some prefer blends like buzzy wax for a less brittle patina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Spray-on oils can also provide a super even coat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Seasoning Process
1.  **Pre-heat**: Heat the pan on medium-low for about 10 minutes to evaporate any residual water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
2.  **Apply Oil**: Rub a tiny amount of oil everywhere with a paper towel, ensuring the thinnest possible layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
3.  **Bake**: Place the pan upside down in the oven to allow excess oil to drip off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Heat the oven to its highest temperature (e.g., 500 degrees Fahrenheit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
4.  **Cool**: Cook the pan in the oven for an hour, then turn off the oven and let the pan gradually cool inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
5.  **Repeat (Optional)**: For a stronger patina, repeat this process five or six more times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

Alternatively, consistent cooking with the pan and proper [[maintenance_and_seasoning_of_cast_iron_pans | cleaning]] and re-oiling will naturally build up the seasoning over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Cleaning and Maintenance
*   **Cleaning**: Gentle scrubbies and warm water are fine for cleaning. Modern soaps are generally safe to use, as they are not typically lye-based like older soaps that could strip seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Avoid very sharp or abrasive tools that could chip the seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Drying and Re-oiling**: After cleaning, dry the pan by putting it back on the heat to evaporate all water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Then, apply a thin coat of oil before storing it. This oil forms a barrier against humidity, preventing rust and contributing to the seasoning with the next use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Versatility
[[benefits_and_challenges_of_using_a_cast_iron_skillet | Cast iron pans]] are incredibly versatile. They can be used for a wide range of cooking tasks, including making brownies or cornbread, braising, searing, and baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. They can easily go from the stovetop directly into the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[benefits_and_challenges_of_using_a_cast_iron_skillet | Cast iron]] is an excellent choice for a pan if used regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Its combination of affordability, durability, superior thermal properties, and potential for a natural non-stick surface makes it a valuable addition to any kitchen.

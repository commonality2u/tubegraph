Both the internet communities for cooking and lifting share a fundamental problem: within a reasonable range, almost anything works, leading to unproductive arguments and flawed thought patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. This environment fosters [[debates_and_arguments_in_cooking_and_lifting_techniques | debates and arguments]] that often lack rigorous scientific backing.

## Science and Studies in Lifting

In the realm of lifting, specifically bodybuilding, online discussions frequently revolve around minute details of exercise execution. For example, a common argument concerns side laterals: whether to internally or externally rotate the humerus for optimal deltoid activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. While studies might show slight differences in muscle activation (e.g., using EMG readings), the actual data often reveals these differences to be minor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

The most significant factors impacting muscle growth and strength are consistent hard work, regular training, genetics, and pharmaceutical enhancement, with diet also playing a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

Professional bodybuilders, despite their impressive physiques, may not fully understand the precise reasons for their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Their progress is a result of years of effort where variables like diet, drug use, and training methods are not isolated, making it difficult to attribute specific gains to a single technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

### Limitations of Scientific Research in Lifting
Scientific studies on exercise, though valuable, have significant limitations:
*   **Small Sample Sizes**
    *   Studies on specific exercises, like the shoulder training example, may involve very few participants (e.g., 10 competitive bodybuilders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.
*   **Indirect Measurements**
    *   Many studies use Electromyography (EMG) to measure muscle activation, but the correlation between EMG readings and actual muscle growth or strength gain is an ongoing scientific debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   **Ethical Constraints**
    *   Unlike objects, human subjects cannot be "destroyed" or have their lives/physiques ruined for experimental purposes, making long-term, isolated variable studies difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   **Funding Priorities**
    *   Less money is available for research into purely cosmetic goals like "getting jacked" compared to critical public health issues such as cancer or heart disease prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
*   **Relevance to Enhanced Athletes**
    *   Most studies focus on "normal humans" rather than "enhanced humans," meaning professional bodybuilders often operate beyond the explored frontiers of science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

Due to these limitations, "bro science"—best guesses and anecdotal evidence—often fills the void in both bodybuilding and [[Cooking Techniques and Philosophy | cooking communities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

## Science and Studies in Cooking

Similar to lifting, [[cooking techniques | cooking technique]] [[debates_and_arguments_in_cooking_and_lifting_techniques | arguments]] often occur online, such as the debate between classical searing (sear first, then cook interior) and reverse searing (cook interior, then sear) a steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Both methods can yield great results, making the argument unwinnable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

It is surprisingly difficult to isolate variables in the kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. The quality of a cooked dish depends on numerous factors, including the cut of meat, heat control, and even the taster's hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. While scientists in controlled laboratory environments can isolate variables using specialized equipment (e.g., measuring shear force for tenderness), this type of rigorous testing is not typical for home cooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

### Focus Areas of Food Science
Food science generally concentrates on two main areas:
*   **Industrial Food Manufacturing**
    *   Research relevant to large-scale food production processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.
*   **Food Safety and Public Health**
    *   Crucial research for ensuring food safety and preventing illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

Consequently, there is limited scientific investment in answering the basic, everyday questions home cooks might have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. This lack of available scientific data necessitates reliance on "bro science" and personal experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

## The Obsession with Minutiae

Both cooking and lifting activities are often highly repetitive, freeing up mental space for practitioners to obsess over trivial details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. For example, a cook might ponder the optimal knife angle or the effect of crushing garlic, while a lifter might focus on subtle angles of alignment or rep schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. These minute variables likely make tiny differences compared to foundational elements like consistency, effort, and progressive overload in the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

This obsession is further amplified by the [[The Impact of Media on Culinary Arts | content marketplace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. Content creators, needing topics, often create or refute "stupid videos" to generate discussion around these minor points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Purpose

Despite these issues, both cooking and lifting discourse compel individuals to ask fundamental questions about [[personal goals and motivations in cooking and lifting | their personal goals and motivations]].
*   **Lifting**: The debate around using lifting straps for deadlifts prompts questions like: Is the goal to move the most weight, build muscle, or to be able to pick up heavy things in real-world scenarios without assistance? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. Similarly, a personal experience of debilitating soreness from heavy squats interfering with playing with an infant led to questioning the ultimate purpose of fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>.
*   **Cooking**: The "scandal" of Chinese sauces thickened with starch, contrasting with European reduction methods, highlights the question: Is the goal to have a delicious, thick sauce that clings to food, or to adhere to a specific, perhaps more laborious, technique? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>. Another core question is whether the main goal is to *have* something good to eat or to *make* something good to eat, which influences choices like using scratch ingredients versus prepared ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>.

Ultimately, once a basic level of competence is achieved, it is often more beneficial to obsess over *why* an activity is performed rather than *how* it is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>.

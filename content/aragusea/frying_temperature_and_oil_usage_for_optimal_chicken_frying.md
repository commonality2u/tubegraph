Achieving perfectly cooked [[traditional_southern_fried_chicken_recipe | Southern fried chicken]] involves careful management of oil temperature and proper oil usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Optimal Frying Temperature

The ideal frying temperature for chicken should be a "fizzle," not a roaring boil or even a sizzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. This fizzing temperature is approximately 250°F (121°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

Using a low frying temperature is crucial because:
*   [[Cooking guidelines for chicken to prevent foodborne illness | Thick pieces of chicken with bones need a long time to cook all the way through]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.
*   Frying at higher temperatures, such as 350°F (177°C), would result in the crust burning before the meat is fully cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
*   The desired crust color for [[traditional_southern_fried_chicken_recipe | fried chicken]] is blonde to gold, not dark brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

### Adjusting Heat During Frying
Initially, burners should be on medium heat until the oil begins swirling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>, then turned down to virtually their lowest setting to maintain the 250°F fizzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. If the crust remains pale as the meat approaches doneness, the heat can be increased at the end to quickly crisp the exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. Once the chicken is mostly cooked, the heat can be raised to medium to help color the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

## Oil Selection and Management

For frying chicken, a neutral oil such as vegetable oil or peanut oil is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

### Oil Depth
Start with approximately a half-inch of oil in the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. As the chicken pieces are added, they will displace the oil, raising the level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Additional oil can be added if needed during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Throughout the frying process, the oil level should come halfway up the sides of the chicken pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. If a piece of chicken stands particularly tall, it can be stood on its end to ensure more surface area is submerged in the oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

### Using Multiple Pans
Using two pans simultaneously is advantageous, allowing for the separation of white meat and dark meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. This provides independent control over their cooking, as they cook differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. Nonstick skillets can be used, though the pan type does not significantly impact the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

### Post-Frying Oil Disposal
Fried chicken oil should **never** be poured down a drain, as it can damage pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. While the oil can be filtered through a cheesecloth and reused, an alternative disposal method is to bury it in a vegetable garden, where it acts as a good fertilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

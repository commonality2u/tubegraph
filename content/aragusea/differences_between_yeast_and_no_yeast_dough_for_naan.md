It is possible to make restaurant-quality garlic naan at home using a pan on the stove, without a tandoor or an oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This can be achieved with either a yeast or a no-yeast dough, each yielding distinct characteristics and ideal for [[making_garlic_naan_without_yeast_or_oven | making garlic naan without yeast or oven]].

## No-Yeast Naan Dough

The no-yeast naan dough primarily relies on [[different_leavening_agents_for_indian_style_breads | chemical leaveners]] and bacterial cultures for its rise and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Ingredients and Preparation
*   **Flour**: Two cups of all-purpose flour (approx. 250 grams) yields enough for four loaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Sugar**: A teaspoon of sugar enhances browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Salt**: Half a teaspoon of salt is suggested, with additional salt preferred as a topping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Baking Powder**: A teaspoon of double-acting baking powder helps with texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Baking Soda**: A scant quarter teaspoon of baking soda is used to neutralize the yogurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Oil**: A couple of tablespoons of any oil, such as olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Yogurt**: About a quarter cup (60 grams) of yogurt, crucially containing live active bacterial cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Liquid**: Enough milk or water to bring the dough together; starting with half a cup (100 ml) and kneading in more as needed is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Indian dough recipes often start with a dry dough and knead in liquid until the right texture is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The ideal texture for this dough is soft but just barely sticky, drier than [[pizza_dough_preparation | pizza dough]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The gluten is developed when the dough bounces back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Resting and Bubbling
While it's a quick bread that could be cooked immediately, letting it sit for at least a half hour under a wet towel improves results, and it gets better with many hours of resting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. After a few hours, the no-yeast dough will puff up a bit, attributed to both the chemical leavening and the live bacteria in the yogurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Kneading the dough a little shortly before cooking helps achieve three or four smaller bubbles instead of one huge bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Cooking Characteristics
When cooked, the bubbles in no-yeast naan are primarily steam from inside or underneath the dough, inflating initial bubbles created by chemical leaveners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This dough works better for tawa style naan, where the dough sticks to the pan and is then inverted over an open flame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Most recipes for tawa naan call for no yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

## Yeast Naan Dough

Yeast dough for naan incorporates dry yeast as its primary leavening agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Ingredients and Preparation
*   **Flour, Sugar, Salt**: Similar quantities to the no-yeast dough: two cups of flour, a teaspoon of sugar, and half a teaspoon of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Dry Yeast**: A teaspoon of dry yeast is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Baking Powder**: Half a teaspoon of baking powder is also typically included, though the interaction between yeast and baking powder in naan recipes is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Olive Oil**: A couple of tablespoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Yogurt**: Only a small amount, like a tablespoon, is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Too much yogurt with yeast can result in a cake-like texture, not bread, possibly due to acidity weakening the gluten structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Liquid**: More milk or water is typically needed compared to no-yeast dough, around a cup total, to achieve the smooth, soft, and slightly sticky texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Rising and Bubbling
Like any yeast bread, this dough needs to rise for at least an hour at room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. After rising, the dough is kneaded again, divided into balls, and then proofed for at least 15 minutes to encourage a second release of gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Cooking Characteristics
When cooked using the tawa method, the yeast dough tends to puff up evenly with many tiny bubbles all the way through, rather than forming giant crisp bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. It also tends to stick less securely to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. While the flavor of yeast naan is often considered superior due to [[process_of_yeast_fermentation_in_bread_making | yeast fermentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, its texture can be inferior for tawa-style naan, resembling a [[differences_between_modern_sandwich_bread_and_traditional_bread | Western dinner roll]] without the desired crisp, bubbly layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Achieving the desired texture with yeast dough might require the intense heat of a tandoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Shared Naan Preparation Techniques

Regardless of the dough type, several techniques are key to making authentic naan at home:

*   **Rolling**: Rolling the dough outward and off the counter prevents it from sticking to the rolling pin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The ideal thickness is slightly less than the thinnest possible roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Garlic and Toppings**: Grated garlic or garlic crushed with salt creates thin, stringy pieces that adhere better to the dough than chopped garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Incorporating toppings like cilantro by rolling them into the dough embeds them, making them part of the bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Wetting the Bottom**: Wetting the bottom side of the dough just before cooking creates a sticky layer of starch paste, which helps it adhere to the pan, mimicking how it would stick to a tandoor wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Pan Choice and Heat**: A cast iron skillet on medium heat works well for cooking naan, mimicking a traditional tawa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Stainless steel pans are less effective as the dough tends not to stick as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Cooking the Top**: For restaurant-style naan, the bottom is cooked until edges look dry, then the pan is inverted over a high flame or electric burner to singe the bubbles and cook the top in hot, dry air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This results in crispy bubbles and a baked flavor, as opposed to a fried taste from cooking in oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Final Touch**: A generous brushing of melted, salted butter at the end complements the slightly under-seasoned dough and is key to the final taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Pan Maintenance**: The pan should be quickly washed and dried after cooking each naan to prevent residue from interfering with the sticking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. A well-seasoned cast iron pan helps the naan stick when desired and release cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

While either dough type can make good naan, the no-yeast dough is often preferred for the specific texture achieved with the tawa-style cooking method, offering those crisp, filo-esque bubbly layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, ideal for [[homemade_pizza_dough_tips | homemade pizza dough tips]] and [[making_new_yorkstyle_pizza_dough_at_home | making New York-style pizza dough at home]] techniques.

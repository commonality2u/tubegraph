Skirt steak, along with [[preparing_and_cooking_hanger_steak | hanger steak]] and short ribs, are considered "not so tender cuts" of beef that require specialized knife work either before, after, or both before and after cooking to make them easily edible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These cuts, often called "butcher's cuts," offer significant flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Types and Characteristics

There are two primary types of skirt steak:
*   **Outside Skirt Steak** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   **Inside Skirt Steak** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

Both cuts originate from around the belly of the animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The outside skirt steak is generally considered superior due to its greater tenderness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Skirt steak is characterized by its very prominent and coarse grain, with meat fibers running side to side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Unlike tender cuts from the animal's back that are thick enough to be cut against the grain, belly cuts like skirt steak are thinner muscles and cannot be cut against the grain as traditional steaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This necessitates specialized treatment from the cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The coarse grain structure also makes these cuts very effective at absorbing marinades, possibly due to the extra surface area created by the ridges in the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. However, outside skirt steak has a beautiful, strong flavor on its own, largely thanks to its fat content, making marinating unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Flank steak, a similar cut from the belly, often benefits from marination as it lacks the same fat content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Preparation

### Initial Cutting
Before cooking, it's recommended to cut the skirt steak into shorter pieces, as wide as your pan. This allows for dividing the meat into segments of similar thickness, ensuring more even cooking times for varying parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Trimming
Sometimes, skirt steak may have a very tough, rubber band-like membrane or sheet of connective tissue attached that must be trimmed off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. However, thin, inconsequential membranes do not need to be trimmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The abundant fat on skirt steak is desirable and should not be trimmed, as it will melt deliciously during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Seasoning
Only simple [[uses_of_raw_ingredients_in_steak_preparation | seasonings]] like salt and pepper are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Be mindful with salt due to the meat's thinness, and go easy on oil as the steak is already quite fatty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Cooking Skirt Steak

### Heat and Pan
An extremely thin steak like skirt steak requires very intense heat to achieve a golden crust before the inside overcooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A cast iron pan is suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The general rule for steak cookery is that the thicker the steak, the lower the temperature needed, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. While high heat is needed for a thin cut, the exact stovetop setting will vary by equipment; for instance, a powerful electric stovetop might only require medium-high heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Experience is key to finding the right setting for your stove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Process
Place thicker pieces in first, often along the cooler edges of the pan, and thinner pieces in the hotter center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Employ constant flipping (every 30 seconds or so) to gradually build a crust and ensure even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Doneness and Resting
*   **Carryover Cooking:** For very thin cuts, the effect of carryover cooking (heat from the outside moving into the interior during resting) is more pronounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This means a thin piece might need to be pulled when it still appears quite raw on the inside, as it will continue to cook during rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Target Doneness:** Outside skirt steak is tender enough to be cooked to medium or even medium-well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Cooking fattier cuts to a greater doneness allows more time for the fat to render and melt, which in turn supplies moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. A visual cue for medium doneness is seeing plenty of pink juice pushing up from the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Resting:** After cooking, allow the steak to rest for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Slicing and Serving

### Crucial Slicing Technique
The crucial step for skirt steak is to slice it very thin *against the grain* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. First, cut the cooked steak in half *with the grain* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If you do not slice against the grain, the steak will be inedibly chewy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. When sliced correctly, the short meat fibers pull apart almost effortlessly, making the steak tender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The resulting shorter slices are perfect bite-sized pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Accompaniments
Outside skirt steak's strong beef flavor means it typically needs no marinade or additional flavoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. However, a common accompaniment is [[using_chimichurri_and_pan_sauces_with_steaks | chimichurri]], a South American pesto-like sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. It is made with raw garlic (sparingly, as it's much stronger than cooked garlic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, fresh herbs like parsley and oregano (or cilantro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, chopped finely by hand to avoid olive oil bitterness from a food processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Other ingredients can include fresh red chili, salt, pepper, olive oil, and a splash of acid like red wine vinegar or lime juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Flavors merge after sitting for a few hours or overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

To prepare [[traditional_southern_fried_chicken_recipe | traditional southern pan-fried chicken]], the most challenging step for beginners is often cutting up a whole raw chicken into at least eight pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This is necessary because a small chicken, ideally 3 to 3.25 pounds, is perfect for frying, and these are usually only available whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Larger birds, often sold pre-cut in grocery stores, are less suitable for fried chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. A 3.5-pound chicken is considered the upper maximum for frying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Tools

You will need:
*   A pair of kitchen shears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   A big, sharp chef's knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>

## Step-by-Step Cutting Process

1.  **Remove the Backbone (Spatchcocking)**: The first and most "gruesome" part is cutting out the chicken's backbone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Using kitchen shears, snip up one side of the spine and then the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. For a small chicken, this shouldn't require much grip strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The backbone can be frozen for [[using_whole_chicken_and_giblets_for_stock | stock]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Flipping the bird over creates a spatchcocked chicken, which is good for [[roasting_chicken_techniques | roasting]] whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
2.  **Separate the Breast Halves**: Take a sharp chef's knife and cut between the two breasts, directly through the breastbone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This might require some force, so commit to the cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. You will now have two half-chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
3.  **Separate Leg Quarters from Breast Quarters**: Without the backbone, there's little holding the leg quarters to the breast quarters, mainly just skin and a small flap of flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   Pull the leg away from the breast and cut through the connecting skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   Once opened, you should see a thin area of meat connecting the two quarters; slice straight through it on the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. You might hit a rib, just crunch through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   Repeat for the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  **Separate Legs from Thighs**: To separate the leg from the thigh, cut into the crook between them until you hit bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Then, pick up the piece and hyperextend the joint to literally dislocate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Ideally, the joint pops apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. If it doesn't pop, it will open up enough for you to see the sinew connecting the joint, making it easy to fit your knife in and cut straight down to the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
    *   Repeat for the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
5.  **Cut the Breast Pieces**: Some people fry the breast with the wing attached, but this often results in too much meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Instead of just cutting off the wing, go up two-thirds of the way from the thin point of the breast and cut straight down through the bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   Repeat for the other breast piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

After these steps, you should have eight nice, tidy pieces of chicken, all of fairly similar size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This amount is typically enough for four people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Using a smaller, home-cut bird also ensures more even cooking and a better meat-to-crust ratio compared to larger birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

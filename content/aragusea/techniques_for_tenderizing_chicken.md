Achieving tender chicken breasts for dishes like chicken parmesan often involves specific preparation methods to ensure even cooking and optimal texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Preparing the Chicken Breast

### Slicing and Pounding
Chicken breasts are often too thick for certain recipes, leading to an unfavorable meat-to-crust ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. To address this:
*   **Cut in half:** Slice the chicken breast horizontally to create two thinner pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While achieving perfectly even halves can be tricky, it's generally manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Pound out:** After slicing, pound the chicken pieces flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
    *   **Tools:** A meat mallet or even a heavy glass can be used, but spiked "medieval things" are suggested for their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Pounding not only flattens and [[cooking_techniques_for_less_tender_cuts | tenderizes]] the meat but also creates small holes, allowing marinades to be absorbed more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   **Appearance:** The initial result might look "like a car accident," but it will be hidden by breading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Seasoning
Instead of seasoning the breading, it's recommended to [[seasoning_and_dry_curing_chicken | season the meat]] directly with a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper on each side for better control over the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Marinating
Marinating is a key step for flavor and tenderness:
*   **Ingredients:** Combine chopped garlic (four or five cloves) with a splash of white wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Process:** Place the seasoned chicken in a bowl with the garlic and wine, swish it around, and refrigerate to [[marinating_chicken_for_tandoori | marinate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** The white wine marinade contributes a "sweet and bright" flavor to the finished dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Cooking for Tenderness

### Frying Thinner Pieces
One of the advantages of cooking thinner chicken pieces is that by the time a golden crust forms on both sides, the meat is typically done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. For example, thin pieces can be fully cooked in about six minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. While a meat thermometer could be used to check for 160Â°F, the visual cue of a golden crust often suffices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

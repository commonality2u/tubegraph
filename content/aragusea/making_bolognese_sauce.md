From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Bolognese sauce is ideal for making in large batches as it can be used for various dishes and freezes exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This recipe aims for a balance, being halfway between a traditional ragù alla Bolognese (with minimal or no tomato) and a traditional Italian-American meat sauce (which is primarily tomato sauce with ground beef clumps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Ingredients & Preparation

### Vegetables
The sauce begins with a pound of carrots, which contribute sweetness and heartiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Carrots**: Peel the skins off as they can be bitter, and cut off the root ends. The tips, though often dried out, don't necessarily need to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. For dicing, cut carrots in half, then into long thin slices, lay slices flat, cut into matchsticks, and then cut across the matchsticks to make a fine dice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Alternatively, use a food processor, breaking carrots into chunks before processing, though the fineness isn't critical as they will break down during long cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Onion**: Include one large red onion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. When using a food processor for onions, cut them into a few chunks first, and process one half at a time to ensure even chopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Cooking Setup
Use the largest pot available, or a couple of smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A 10-quart Dutch oven is recommended for its versatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Frying Vegetables
Fry the diced carrots and onions in olive oil over high heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Since vegetables contain a lot of water, they won't burn as long as they are kept moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Cook until they shrink down and become soft, then remove them from the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Browning the Meat
Add more olive oil to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, then add three pounds of ground meat, such as beef chuck (preferred for its fat) or leaner sirloin, or even lamb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Breaking Apart Meat**: This is the most crucial and labor-intensive step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Use a rigid wooden spoon to mash and break apart the ground meat as it cooks, preventing the formation of "meatballs" in the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Water Evaporation**: Initially, the meat will turn gray and be swimming in liquid, which is mostly water, not fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Continue cooking on high heat, stirring to prevent sticking and burning, until the water boils off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Browning**: After about five minutes, as the water evaporates, the sound will change from a hiss to a roar and crackle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This indicates the meat is frying in its rendered fat and will begin to brown, filling the kitchen with an amazing aroma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Secret Ingredient: [[using_chicken_livers_in_bolognese_sauce | Chicken Livers]]
Add a pound of chicken livers to the food processor, processing them to a coarse, almost pâté-like consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Incorporate them towards the end of the meat browning process, being careful not to overcook them, as this can make them gritty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The livers will make the meat sauce taste significantly "meatier" without imparting a distinct liver flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Building the Sauce
*   **Tomato Paste**: Stir in a six-ounce can of tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Deglazing**: When a carpet of brown bits starts to stick to the bottom of the pan and is about to burn, pour in a whole bottle of white wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Scrape the bottom of the pan thoroughly to release all the flavorful fond, which will otherwise burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Adding Back Vegetables**: Return the previously cooked vegetables to the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Tomatoes**: Add three 28-ounce cans of good-quality crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Bouillon**: Stir in a large spoonful of liquid chicken bouillon. It's very salty but balances the large pot of sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Cooking Process
Bring the sauce to a gentle burble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Simmer for three hours, stirring approximately every 15 minutes to ensure the bottom doesn't catch and burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The sauce will thicken due to the solids breaking down, even if it doesn't reduce significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Seasoning
After about two hours, season the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Herbs**: Add about a tablespoon each of dried basil, dried parsley, and dried oregano, with slightly less dried thyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Dried herbs are generally better for long-cook dishes and taste best when added during the last hour of cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Garlic & Pepper**: Include a generous amount of garlic powder and a whole bunch of pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Balsamic Vinegar**: Add about a quarter cup of balsamic vinegar for an instant source of sweet and sour flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Balsamic vinegar can be added whenever the sauce is hot, as the heat will boil off its harsh scent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

After the three-hour simmer, taste and adjust seasoning, potentially adding more balsamic vinegar and salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Remember that sauces should be slightly "too strong" in flavor, as their taste will be diluted by the rest of the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## [[serving_and_variations_of_bolognese_sauce | Serving and Variations]]

*   **Classic Serving**: Serve with drained pasta, a couple of big spoonfuls of sauce per portion, fresh parsley, grated cheese, and a drizzle of raw olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Creamy Variation**: For a richer sauce, spoon some bolognese into a separate pot, drizzle in heavy cream, and boil until the cream thickens. Add pasta and fresh basil for a sweet, sour, meaty, velvety, and rich dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## [[freezing_and_storing_bolognese_sauce | Freezing and Storing Bolognese Sauce]]

Allow the sauce to cool, then smear it into ice cube trays for easy portioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Freeze overnight, then twist the trays to release the frozen cubes and transfer them to a large Ziploc bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

To reheat, grab about three cubes per person, place them in a bowl, and microwave until thawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. While still hot, add a little more balsamic vinegar to brighten the flavor after freezing, as the heat will boil off the vinegar's harshness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This allows for a deeply flavored, slow-simmered, home-cooked meal in about 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Other Uses
Leftover bolognese sauce can be used to make lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

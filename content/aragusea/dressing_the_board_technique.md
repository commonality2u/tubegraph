From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

The "dressing the board" [[cooking techniques | technique]] is a classic method for flavoring cooked meat, particularly steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This approach leverages the natural properties of meat, which, while expelling moisture during cooking, reabsorbs moisture as it cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead of seasoning the steak directly, the flavors are prepared on the cutting board, where they infuse the meat as it rests and is cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Advantages of Dressing the Board

*   **Efficient Preparation:** All flavorings can be prepped on the cutting board while the steak is cooking, significantly reducing overall [[preparing filling ingredients | preparation]] time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This means a meal like steak can go from start to dinner in as little as 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Flavor Absorption:** As the cooked steak rests on the dressed board and is later tossed in its juices, it reabsorbs moisture and flavors, leading to a more infused and delicious result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Optimal Seasoning:** It allows for fresh, uncooked flavors to be incorporated, such as raw pepper, which maintains its pungency better than cooked pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Preparing the Steak

Before cooking, only oil should be applied to the steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While some salt and pepper can be added, salting immediately before cooking is not effective for browning and is considered a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. If pre-salting, it should be done at least 40 minutes in advance, as recommended by Kenji's authoritative article on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Dressing the Board: Ingredients and Method

The [[seasoning_cutting_board_instead_of_steak | seasoning the cutting board instead of the steak]] allows for fresh, vibrant flavors to be incorporated without burning or losing potency during cooking. Any tender cut of meat can be used with this method, and creativity with flavors is encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54">[03:54]</a>.

### Common Ingredients

Typical ingredients used to dress the board include:
*   **Rosemary:** Chopped fresh rosemary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Garlic:** A small clove of finely grated garlic, used sparingly as it will be virtually raw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Citrus:** A squeeze of lemon, lime, or even grapefruit, adds brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Pepper:** A generous amount of coarsely ground pepper, preferred raw to maintain its pungency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Salt:** A small amount of salt on the board for initial distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Butter:** A couple of slivers of fresh butter, which melts from the steak's heat and offers a milky contrast to the steak's deep flavor. Many classic American steakhouses finish with fresh butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Process

1.  **Prep the Board:** While the steak cooks, chop rosemary, grate garlic, add citrus juice, coarsely grind pepper, and place slivers of butter and a small amount of salt directly onto the cutting board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
2.  **Cook and Rest Steak:** Cook the steak (e.g., a strip steak cooked for nine minutes total, rested for five minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
3.  **Transfer to Board:** Place the hot, cooked steak directly on top of the prepared ingredients on the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The steak's heat will soften the rosemary, melt the butter, and take the edge off the raw garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
4.  **Slice and Toss:** Observe the juices that come out of the meat onto the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Slice the steak into thin, bite-sized pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Then, toss the steak pieces in the flavorful pool of beef juice and melted ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This step allows the meat to reabsorb moisture and flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
5.  **Serve Warm:** To prevent the meat from going cold, either eat it straight off the board or serve on a warmed plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49">[02:49]</a>. Plates can be warmed by running them under hot water for a minute on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">[02:57]</a>. A hot plate can even reheat a well-rested piece of meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05">[03:05]</a>.

## Finishing Salt

While some salt goes on the board, most of the salt should be added as a super coarse finishing salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32">[03:32]</a>. This provides "little sparks of salt" in big, crunchy crystals on top, which is more interesting and delicious than a uniform, blanket low-level saltiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41">[03:41]</a>.

Even without added flavorings, simply tossing the meat in its own juices reclaimed from the board is a beneficial practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00">[04:00]</a>. This [[benefits_of_using_flavored_cutting_boards | technique]] not only enhances taste but also contributes to better [[food presentation | food presentation]] by utilizing the juices.

[[what_is_malt | Malt]] is a "truly magical ingredient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> that is both simple and complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Simply put, [[what_is_malt | malt]] is any cereal grain that has been allowed to germinate or sprout, beginning to grow into a new plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This process of sprouting makes the grain "particularly nutritious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> and unlocks "amazing properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> due to the enzymes it produces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Initiating Germination

To make [[what_is_malt | malt]], you need intact, whole grain that has been dried into dormancy but is still viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. While wheat can be malted, barley is the most popular grain for [[malt_production_and_germination_process | malting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Other grains like rice, rye, oats, and corn can also be malted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

The initial step is to wash the grain, which helps remove dead seeds, chaff, and microorganisms that could cause spoilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The grains are then submerged in water, ideally somewhere cool, to mimic a "nice cool spring rain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This soaking "kickstarts the [[malt_production_and_germination_process | malting process]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> by hydrating the seed to just under 50% hydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## The Role of Enzymes: Amylase

As water enters the seed, it activates proteins, and the cells begin to produce proteins called amylases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

*   **Enzymes as Catalysts:** Amylase is an enzyme, a type of protein whose primary function is to "catalyze or start up a biological process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Unlike structural proteins, enzymes "do something, not be something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The seed triggers a genetic process to build these proteins from its existing amino acids when it gets wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Starch Breakdown:** The seed produces amylase to break down the starch stored within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Starch molecules are large, branched chains of thousands of sugars that serve as the energy store for the growing plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Production of Simple Sugars:** The baby plant cannot consume these large starch molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Amylase breaks them down into smaller, simpler sugars, most notably maltose (a disaccharide of two glucose units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. These simple sugars, like glucose, are essential for cellular respiration, providing energy for the cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

After soaking, grains are periodically spritzed with water and turned to ensure air access and prevent drying out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. During this phase, rootlets (baby roots) and the acrospire (or plumule, the above-ground part of the plant) emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The [[malt_production_and_germination_process | malting process]] is considered complete when the acrospire is almost as long as the seed itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Halting the Process: Kilning

Once the acrospire reaches the desired length, the plant's growth is halted by drying it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The goal is to develop a "large portion of active amylase enzymes" within the seed without allowing the plant to use up all the starch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This drying process is known as kilning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

*   **Base Malts and Enzyme Preservation:** To produce a [[types_of_malt_and_their_uses | base malt]], grains are dried slowly or at lower temperatures (below 149째F/65째C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This prevents the enzymes from being denatured or cooked, which would render them incapable of converting starches into sugars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Diastatic Power:** The effectiveness of [[what_is_malt | malt]] in converting starch to sugar is measured by its "diastatic power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, essentially the percentage of remaining amylase present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. [[types_of_malt_and_their_uses | Base malts]] have a very high diastatic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Diastase is an older term for amylase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Diastatic Malts:** If grains are roasted at higher temperatures, especially above 180째F/85째C, the amylase enzymes are rapidly denatured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. These [[types_of_malt_and_their_uses | non-diastatic malts]] have no enzymatic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a> and are used primarily for their flavor and color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Roasting causes browning reactions between proteins and sugars, creating complex flavor compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## Applications of Enzymatic Malt

The enzymes in [[what_is_malt | malt]], particularly amylase, are crucial for several industries:

*   **[[malt_in_beverages_and_baked_goods | Baking]]**: Bakers use amylase from [[what_is_malt | malt]] to provide food for yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Yeast can only ferment sugars that are "three glucose units long" or shorter, preferably one or two units long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The enzymes break down the larger starches in the flour into these fermentable sugars, allowing the yeast to produce carbon dioxide and make bread dough rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Many bread flours already contain added [[malt_in_beverages_and_baked_goods | malt]] flour or enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Brewing and Distilling**: Brewers and distillers use amylase to feed yeast, allowing them to convert sugars into alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. They crush [[types_of_malt_and_their_uses | diastatic malt]] with other grains and soak them in water to create a "mash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Warming the mash allows the amylase to break down starches into sugars, resulting in a sweet liquid called "wort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. After draining the wort, yeast is added for [[fermentation_process_and_biological_limits_of_yeast | fermentation]] into beer or spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
    *   Barley is preferred for [[malt_production_and_germination_process | malting]] in brewing because it has less gluten than wheat, allowing for cleaner draining of the wort from the grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Wheat and corn create a gummy, sticky mass that doesn't drain well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 
A Dutch baby is a type of popover, similar to a Yorkshire pudding, baked in a wide pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It is essentially a very wet, unleavened [[making_foolproof_pancake_batter | pancake batter]] that steams and puffs up significantly in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The [[History and origin of Dutch baby pancakes | origin of the name]] is disputed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Batter Preparation

#### Warming Ingredients
For a bigger rise, it is beneficial for the batter to be warm before it goes into the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Eggs:** Warm refrigerated eggs for about a minute in hot tap water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Milk:** Warm cold milk in the microwave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Ensure the milk is not so hot that it prematurely cooks the eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

#### Basic Ratios
The traditional ratio for Dutch baby batter is:
*   One-third of a cup (80 ml) of milk per egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   One-third of a cup (40 grams) of flour per egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

#### Mixing the Batter
The batter needs to be very well mixed for a bigger rise and smoother surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Method:** While people often use a blender, a whisk and a bowl can also be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Crack eggs into the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    2.  Add salt and sugar (see specific quantities below) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
    3.  Beat until the eggs are very loose and frothy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    4.  Whisk in the flour and starch mixture until smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. It is easier to whisk out lumps when the mixture is thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
    5.  Gradually whisk in the warm milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

#### Resting the Batter
Like [[variations_and_tips_for_cooking_pancakes | crepes]], the batter should sit for at least 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This allows particles to hydrate and proteins to autolyze, making the batter more elastic and able to expand like a balloon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Some people even let the batter sit overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Sweet Dutch Baby Batter

To prepare a [[traditional_sweet_dutch_baby_recipe | sweet Dutch baby]] batter:
*   Add a big pinch of salt per egg (e.g., 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt per egg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   Include about a teaspoon of sugar per egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   Add a "glug" of vanilla extract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   For a more tender texture, replace up to half of the flour with starch (e.g., cornstarch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This may result in a slightly less puffy but more pleasant-to-eat product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Savory Dutch Baby Batter

For a [[savory_dutch_baby_preparation and toppings | savory Dutch baby]] batter:
*   Include a big pinch of salt per egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   Add a teaspoon of sugar per egg; this will not make it a dessert but will enhance the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   Do not add vanilla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   Replace almost half of the flour with cornstarch to tenderize the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Incorporate a spoonful of any soft, spreadable cheese, such as ricotta, brie, or mascarpone, to significantly improve the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Adding cheese may reduce the puff slightly, but the pancake will collapse anyway after coming out of the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

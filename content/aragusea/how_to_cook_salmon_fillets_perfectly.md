From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Salmon is an excellent fish for those new to cooking fish, as it is very forgiving due to its high fat content. It can be delicious when cooked perfectly medium, undercooked (even raw), or even slightly overcooked, making it difficult to ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Shopping for Salmon Fillets

When selecting salmon, you'll typically restrict yourself to [[identifying_different_cuts_of_salmon_fillets | fillets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### [[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | Farmed versus Wild Salmon]]

*   **Color:**
    *   [[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | Farmed salmon]] often has a pale orange color, reminiscent of a creamsicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Its flesh would be gray if farmers didn't feed them the pigment [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | astaxanthin]] to achieve a more natural color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   [[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | Wild salmon]] has a more intense color, such as the reddish hue of sockeye salmon, which is like the inside of a blood orange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Wild salmon naturally obtain astaxanthin from the crustaceans they eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Fat Content:**
    *   [[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | Farmed salmon]] often has a higher fat content, visible as white ribbons running through the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   While high fat content can be good, [[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | wild salmon]] is arguably superior in the *type* of fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Both types of salmon contain a mix of [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | omega-3]] and [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | omega-6]] fatty acids. However, wild salmon provides a more beneficial ratio, with more [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | omega-3s]] and less [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | omega-6s]], which is generally healthier for those with a standard Western diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Availability:** Unless you live near a fishery in places like Alaska, your salmon will likely have been frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Modern flash freezing is highly effective at preserving quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### [[identifying_different_cuts_of_salmon_fillets | Fillet Shapes]]

Salmon fillets typically come in three basic shapes depending on where they were cut from the whole side of fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>:
*   **[[identifying_different_cuts_of_salmon_fillets | Car piece]]:** Resembles a small hatchback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This cut has uneven thickness, offering a sampler of doneness from rare to well-done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The thinner belly part has more fat and can be "overcooked" to a delicious fried texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **[[identifying_different_cuts_of_salmon_fillets | Flat piece]]:** Thinner, more even pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. These are good for even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **[[identifying_different_cuts_of_salmon_fillets | Tail piece]]:** Recognizable by its tapered end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Similar to flat pieces, they offer even thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Preparing Salmon Fillets

*   **Pin Bones:** Even though fillets are cut off the bone, they often still contain a few small pin bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. You can usually spot them poking up and pull them out with your fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Skin:** The scales are typically removed, so many people eat the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. If you prefer not to eat it, it's significantly easier to remove the skin *after* the fish is [[cooking_methods_for_salmon_fillets | cooked]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## [[cooking_methods_for_salmon_fillets | Cooking Methods for Salmon Fillets]]

### Pan-Frying

1.  **Seasoning:** Season your salmon with salt, pepper, and garlic powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Garlic powder pairs perfectly with salmon and browns nicely at the ideal searing temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
2.  **Heat and Oil:** Heat a little olive oil in your pan over medium heat until it shimmers but isn't smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. You want a mild sizzle with salmon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
3.  **Cooking Approach:** Cook the salmon most of the way on the flesh side to develop a delicious crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
4.  **Doneness Indicator ("The Window"):** Salmon has a natural "window" on its side, allowing you to see the color change as it cooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   **Medium-Rare/Perfect:** Flip the fish when the color change indicates it's cooked halfway through at most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Pull it off the heat when the cross-section still looks a hair raw at the very center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This results in smooth, moist salmon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Resting for a second helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   **Undercooked (but safe):** If you pull it when visibly raw on the inside, it will be warm but basically raw at the center, flaking instead of crumbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This is safe to eat as parasites are killed by freezing, and surface bacteria are sterilized during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
    *   **Overcooked (but still good):** If you wait until the cross-section has fully changed color, it will crumble when flaked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. However, salmon's fat content compensates for water loss, keeping the fish moist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
5.  **Pan Choice:**
    *   **Stainless Steel:** Prone to sticking. Wait until the [[baking_techniques_for_perfect_crust | crust]] is set before attempting to flip to prevent it from sticking and breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   **Teflon (Nonstick):** The easiest option, especially if you're not confident, as it prevents sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Ideal for fish and [[cooking_techniques_for_perfect_eggs_controlling_heat_using_butter_or_oil | eggs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   **Well-Seasoned Cast Iron:** A good alternative to Teflon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
6.  **Basting:** After flipping, you can add some [[cooking_techniques_for_perfect_eggs_controlling_heat_using_butter_or_oil | butter]] and lemon juice to the pan for basting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This creates a beurre blanc-like sauce with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
7.  **Serving:** Serve with a simple side like [[broccoli_cooking_techniques | steamed broccoli]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Broiling (Under the Grill)

1.  **Preparation:** Use an oven-safe pan. Add oil to a cold pan, then coat the salmon fillet in the oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Season with pepper, but initially no salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
2.  **Broiler Temperature:** Unless the fillet is unusually thick, set your broiler to the highest heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
3.  **Glaze (Optional):** Apply a quick glaze of honey and soy sauce. The soy sauce adds salt, so no initial salt is needed on the fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Apply an initial brushing, broil, then a second brushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
4.  **Doneness:** After about 5 minutes total, look for small spaces opening up between the flakes of meat, indicating it's cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. No need to flip under the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Cheesy Mashed Potato Crusted Salmon

This method is great for using leftover mashed potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

1.  **Prepare Mash:** Heat mashed potatoes in the microwave until soft and spreadable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
2.  **Additions:** Mix in fresh herbs like dill (a classic with salmon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Add a generous handful of shredded cheese (e.g., Parmesan) to help bind the [[baking_techniques_for_perfect_crust | crust]] and add flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
3.  **Salmon Prep:** Add a little oil to an oven-safe pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Season the salmon with salt (this step is important) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
4.  **Apply Crust:** Press a thin layer of the cheesy mash over the salmon, leaving a small exposed chunk to watch for doneness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. A [[identifying_different_cuts_of_salmon_fillets | flat piece]] of salmon works best for even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
5.  **Cook:** Broil under an all-the-way-hot broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
6.  **Doneness:** Pull when the [[baking_techniques_for_perfect_crust | crust]] is brown and the salmon flakes are just starting to open up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

Salmon is a quick, easy, and healthy option for a weeknight meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. [[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | Wild salmon]], particularly Bristol Bay sockeye salmon, is known for its high [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | omega-3]] to [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | omega-6]] ratio and natural [[nutritional_benefits_of_salmon | astaxanthin]] content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

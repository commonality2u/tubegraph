Many homeowners seeking to [[setting_up_aquaculture_systems_in_residential_settings | set up aquaculture systems in residential settings]] or simply keep a large volume of fish for entertainment might overlook a unique solution: the home cistern. While not originally designed for aquatic life, these underground water reservoirs offer surprising advantages for fishkeeping, particularly for species that thrive in cool, clean water.

## What is a Cistern?

A cistern is an ancient and critical human technology for collecting and storing fresh water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. In the absence of a pristine, fast-moving natural stream, collecting rainwater was often the best method for obtaining potable water without advanced technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

In certain areas, like a Kentucky suburb south of Cincinnati, wells were not feasible due to geological conditions or lack of clean groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. When houses were built in the 1950s and 60s, well water and municipal water mains were unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. However, the southeastern United States generally has abundant rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Therefore, cisterns were constructed by directing rainwater from roof gutters via pipes into a water-safe containment area, often under the house or garage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. These concrete structures were built to hold all the water a household might need for drinking, bathing, and other uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## The Eel Pit: A Case Study

Nick Tobler and his brother Chris discovered a manhole cover in the garage of their grandfather's house, revealing a huge empty room with a foot of water on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Nick, an amateur naturalist who grew up exploring streams and working in pet shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, immediately saw its potential for fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. He named it the "Eel Pit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Size and Scope
Nick's cistern is a large concrete structure under the garage, holding an astounding volume of water â€“ he estimates about 5,000 to 6,000 gallons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. For context, a PVC tank specifically sold for [[setting_up_aquaculture_systems_in_residential_settings | aquaculture]] (growing fish for food) might only be 300 gallons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Nick maintains the water level at about thigh height to allow movement on concrete block islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Species Kept
While Nick doesn't plan to eat his fish, considering them pets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, his collection includes:
*   Freshwater American eels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
*   Two Diamond sturgeon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   Two Albino sterlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
*   Gar (which resemble alligators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   Catfish (hiding in cinder blocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
*   Blue crabs (saved from an Asian market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>

Sturgeon are notable as the fish from which caviar is harvested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Harvesting sturgeon eggs for caviar is generally fatal to the fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Suitable Fish for Consumption
For those considering using a cistern to raise [[species_of_fish_suited_for_home_cistern_environments | fish for food]], Nick suggests:
*   **Trout:** Described as delicious and productive freshwater fish that prefer cold water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Most fish consumed are cold water species, as they evolve to be bigger in cold water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Catfish:** Also a good option for such a setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Advantages of Using Cisterns for Aquaculture

The "Eel Pit" demonstrates several key advantages of using [[advantages_and_challenges_of_using_rainwater_systems_for_aquaculture | rainwater systems for aquaculture]]:

*   **Stable Temperature:** Being underground, the water remains remarkably stable in temperature, typically between 40 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit year-round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Earth acts as a great insulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This is crucial for species like sturgeon, which require cool water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Outdoor fish farms in warmer climates can suffer from high summer water temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Clean Water Source:** Fed by rain, the cistern water is exceptionally clean and pure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This meets the requirement for fish like sturgeon that need very clean water, similar to a mountain stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Challenges and Solutions for Water Quality

The biggest challenge in any [[setting_up_aquaculture_systems_in_residential_settings | aquaculture system]] is [[water_purification_and_oxygenation_methods_in_fish_tanks | water quality]], specifically preventing fish from poisoning themselves with ammonia from their waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Water Changes and Filtration
Nick's primary method for maintaining water quality involves pumping dirty water out and letting clean rainwater fall back in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. If there's no rain, he uses a garden hose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

For more advanced filtration, Nick uses a system above the cistern:
1.  **Acclimation Tank:** A plastic tank in the garage is used to acclimate new fish or allow fry to grow safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
2.  **Filter Drum with Bioballs:** Water from the acclimation tank passes through a filter drum filled with "bioballs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. These balls provide ample surface area for beneficial bacteria to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. These bacteria convert harmful ammonia into less toxic nitrates, effectively filtering the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Oxygenation
Oxygenation is critical, especially for species with high oxygen needs like sturgeon, which are accustomed to oxygen-rich mountain streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. In still water, sturgeon must constantly swim to breathe, similar to sharks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
Nick ensures adequate oxygenation through:
*   **Splashing Water:** The water pouring back into the cistern is intentionally splashed to introduce oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Airstones:** Several airstones run across the water to further increase dissolved oxygen levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Substrate and Plant Considerations
Nick uses a river rock substrate instead of sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This is to prevent pockets of gas from building up in the enclosed environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, ensuring ample gas exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

Plants, while normally helpful for filtering water, are not suitable for the "Eel Pit" because:
*   Sturgeon can get caught and drown in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   In a confined, cold space, rotting plant matter could produce gases harmful to both fish and humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Historical Precedent

While modern examples of using home cisterns for raising fish to eat are rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, cisterns have been used to keep fish for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The famous Cisterns of Constantinople (now Istanbul) were legendarily used by Byzantines to keep fish as an early warning system against water poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

The potential for modern home [[setting_up_aquaculture_systems_in_residential_settings | aquaculture]] in forgotten cisterns remains largely untapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

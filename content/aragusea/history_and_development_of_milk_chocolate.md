While the [[hershey_chocolate_taste_profile_and_consumer_perception | Hershey bar]] is often considered "America's favorite chocolate bar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, many people from other parts of the world describe its taste as resembling vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This distinct flavor, which American consumers have come to expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, has an interesting history and science behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Chocolate's Ancient Origins

For nearly all of its 4,000-year [[history_of_food_preservation_methods | history]], chocolate was consumed as a beverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Ancient Mesoamericans harvested cacao beans, combining them with water to create a drink used for medicinal and ceremonial purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This process may have involved fermenting the cacao to produce alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Europeans acquired chocolate from the Aztecs following the Spanish conquest in the 16th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The Spanish also used it as a medicine, as unsweetened cocoa is notably bitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The addition of sugar by someone in the Spanish court transformed chocolate into a pleasure drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Eventually, milk was introduced to the water-based cocoa drink, similar to how it's added to coffee, to smooth the texture and soften bitter flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## The Rise of Solid Chocolate

It wasn't until the 19th century that European confectioners began developing solid chocolate products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. These early solid chocolates consisted of cocoa powder (cocoa solids), cocoa fat (cocoa butter), and sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Milk was later added for the same reasons it was used in the beverageâ€”to improve smoothness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Early dark chocolates were often described as gritty and harsh, and milk helped mitigate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Directly pouring milk into solid chocolate is not feasible, as milk is mostly water, which does not mix with fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, and high water content can lead to microbial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The solution came from **Henry Nestle**, who developed a process to create dehydrated, powdered milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. His neighbor, **Daniel Peter**, then added this powdered milk to his solid chocolate mix, leading to the birth of milk chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. In England, [[differences_between_hershey_and_cadbury_chocolates | Cadbury's]] first solid milk chocolate also utilized powdered milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Chocolatiers soon discovered that using condensed milk (milk with much of its water boiled out, but still liquid) yielded an even smoother product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Milton Hershey's Innovation

In the United States, wealthy caramel maker **Milton Hershey** aimed to develop his own milk chocolate process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. In 1903, he began experimenting with milk at his family homestead in Pennsylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

His team initially focused on using skim milk (milk with fat removed) to prevent rancidity, which was crucial for the shelf-stable, mass-produced product Hershey envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. He cooked batches of milk in a giant copper vacuum pan, which lowered the boiling point and allowed water to be driven off at lower temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Unsatisfied with the results, Hershey sought the help of factory worker **John Schmalbach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Schmalbach mixed skim milk with sugar and cooked it in the vacuum pan at a very low temperature for an extended period, then allowed it to cool while still in the vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This process yielded a perfect batch of milk for Hershey, producing a chocolate with a desirable "snap," smoothness, and shelf stability, making it ideal for mass production via pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### The Taste of Butyric Acid

Hershey's low-temperature reduction process soured the milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Chocolate experts generally agree that the sour taste in [[hershey_chocolate_taste_profile_and_consumer_perception | Hershey's]] chocolate is due to [[chemistry_of_butyric_acid_in_hershey_chocolate | butyric acid]], or "butter acid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This acid is created by lipolyzing (breaking down) the milk fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Butyric acid can be formed through anaerobic fermentation, which aligns with the vacuum pan process Hershey used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. It is also produced in our digestive systems and is associated with the smell and taste of vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

This connection to butyric acid explains why many people who did not grow up eating Hershey's chocolate find its taste akin to sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. However, for those accustomed to it, like many Americans, butyric acid tastes like chocolate, not sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

> I grew up in central Pennsylvania not far from where milton hershey lived there's an amusement park there now called hershey park every summer my parents would take me there to ride the roller coasters and on the way out they would buy me a giant novelty hershey kiss and i would slowly nibble away on that all summer long those warm feelings are half of what i'm tasting when i'm tasting this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>

Conversely, many Americans describe imported chocolates, such as [[differences_between_hershey_and_cadbury_chocolates | British Cadbury]], as "flat" or "dull," lacking the expected acidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. [[differences_between_hershey_and_cadbury_chocolates | Cadbury]] also uses vegetable oils in addition to cocoa butter, contributing to its smoother, creamier texture compared to Hershey's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Quality and Perception

A 2015 BBC focus group comparing Hershey's and [[differences_between_hershey_and_cadbury_chocolates | Cadbury]] found that adult groups preferred Cadbury, describing Hershey's as "harder, more bitter, not as rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Interestingly, British children were more likely to choose the [[hershey_chocolate_taste_profile_and_consumer_perception | Hershey bar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

Despite common belief, the BBC investigation found that [[hershey_chocolate_taste_profile_and_consumer_perception | Cadbury]] and [[hershey_chocolate_taste_profile_and_consumer_perception | Hershey]] have approximately the same proportion of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, with perceived differences largely stemming from differing labeling regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. While the EU standard for minimum cocoa content in milk chocolate is higher, the measurement standards differ (dry cocoa solids vs. chocolate liquor), making direct comparisons complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. A Hershey spokesman claimed their chocolate contains 30% cocoa solids, which would be higher than Cadbury's stated 23% for their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Ultimately, the quality of a food, especially a dessert, can be highly subjective, often influenced by personal history and positive associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Foods that balance enticement and revulsion, such as certain fermented products like Parmesan cheese (which also contains butyric acid), are celebrated in many cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

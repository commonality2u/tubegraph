Schnitzel, the German term for any very thin cut of meat that has been breaded and fried, is a simple yet delicious dish. The iconic *Wienerschnitzel* from Vienna is specifically made from veal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Preparing the Meat

The key to a good schnitzel is very thin meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Thinning
Meat cuts like veal scallopini, common in the U.S., are already thin, but should be made even thinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Place a layer of plastic wrap over the meat and use a smooth meat mallet to pound it as flat as possible without tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This also applies to other meats like pork and chicken.

### Seasoning
It is recommended to season the meat directly, not the breading, as it's easier to judge the amount of salt needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Since schnitzel is very thin, go easy on the salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Breading Techniques

The [[breading_techniques_and_variations_for_schnitzel | breading process]] for schnitzel involves three main steps: flour, egg, and breadcrumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Everything should be as light and thin as possible, knocking off any excess at each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Breadcrumbs
Traditional schnitzel uses homemade breadcrumbs from stale bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, but modern bread often doesn't dry out enough to make fine crumbs suitable for schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

*   **Store-bought breadcrumbs:** Very fine and bone dry, these are a good option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Panko:** While not traditional, [[Breading chicken with panko and cheese | Japanese panko breadcrumbs]] are exceptionally crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. They can be ground in a food processor to make them fine enough for schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Using blitzed panko is considered foolproof for crispy results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Application:** When applying breadcrumbs, do not press the meat into them; just let whatever sticks adhere lightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Traditional Fats and Frying Techniques

Schnitzel generally requires very little oil for home frying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Frying Fats
*   **[[Clarified butter and its role in cooking schnitzel | Clarified butter]] (Ghee):** This is one of the [[traditional_fats_and_oils_for_frying_schnitzel | traditional fats for schnitzel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. You can make it by melting butter over medium-low heat until milk proteins rise and water evaporates, then straining it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. It's pure butter fat, so it won't burn or splatter at medium-high heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The taste of [[Clarified butter and its role in cooking schnitzel | clarified butter]] is a dominant flavor in the finished dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Lard:** Another traditional schnitzel fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. It melts quickly in a hot pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Note that lard imparts a strong pork flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Vegetable Oil:** A neutral frying oil like vegetable oil is also acceptable for any schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Frying Technique
The easiest way to test the oil temperature is to dip a corner of the meat into it; if it sizzles a lot, it's ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Schnitzel should be "swimming" in the fat, meaning it's floating above the pan's surface but not submerged like deep-frying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Flipping the schnitzel multiple times (constant flipping) helps it cook more evenly and prevents burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. With such thin meat, the inside will be done when the outside looks done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. After frying, place the schnitzel on a rack or paper towels to drain and rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Specific Schnitzel Types

### Wienerschnitzel (Veal)
*   **Meat:** Use veal scallopini, which are very thin slices of veal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Frying Fat:** [[Clarified butter and its role in cooking schnitzel | Clarified butter]] is a traditional fat for *Wienerschnitzel* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Note:** While veal's ethics can be debated, the industry has largely phased out confining calves to crates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Schweinen Schnitzel (Pork)
*   **Meat:** Boneless pork loin chops can be used for *Schweinen Schnitzel* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Butterfly them by cutting almost all the way through and opening them like a book, then pound thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Plastic wrap should be used when pounding to prevent bacterial splatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Frying Fat:** Lard is a traditional fat for pork schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Be aware that it will give the pork a strong "piggy" flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Cultural Note:** In Indiana, a similar German-descended classic is the "tenderloin sandwich," typically made with loin, served on a comically small bun with mustard, onions, and pickles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Chicken Schnitzel
*   **Meat:** Large chicken breasts can be halved and pounded thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Chicken tends to shred and break apart more when pounded, so be careful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Breading Variation:** A big spoonful of mustard can be mixed into the egg wash for an added flavor kick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This is not traditional but is very tasty, though it may contribute to uneven coloring on the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Frying Fat:** Good old vegetable oil is perfectly fine for [[cooking_techniques_for_vegetables_and_meat | frying chicken schnitzel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Side Dishes

### [[Cucumber salad variations as a schnitzel side dish | Cucumber Salad]]
A favorite traditional side for schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

#### Oil and Vinegar Version
*   **Ingredients:** Thinly sliced English cucumber (which comes unwaxed and can be eaten unpeeled), half a red onion sliced into quarter rounds, and a bunch of fresh dill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Dressing:** Eyeball equal quantities of white vinegar and any neutral oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Add pepper, a pinch of salt, and a big pinch of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Preparation:** Stir well and make hours or even a day before eating to allow it to pickle slightly in the fridge, releasing moisture from the vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Taste and adjust seasoning before serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

#### Creamy Version
This variation uses the exact same ingredients as the oil and vinegar version, but instead of oil, it uses sour cream and vinegar for the dressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Eyeball the sour cream to achieve desired creaminess, and let it sit in the fridge before tasting and adjusting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Other Traditional Sides
*   Fries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>
*   Potato salad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>

## Serving
Serve schnitzel with fresh parsley on top and an ample squeeze of fresh lemon, which is considered essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. For seasoning, it's advisable to be conservative with salt during [[preparing_filling_ingredients | preparation]], as more can always be added at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Advanced Techniques and Variations

*   **Pan-Shaking:** A technique used by expert schnitzel cooks involves aggressively shaking the pan to partially separate the breading from the meat, creating a phyllo-like shell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This is difficult to master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Chicken Fried Steak:** German and Austrian immigrants in Texas adapted schnitzel to beef, resulting in chicken fried steak, a classic American dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

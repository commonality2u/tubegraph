The ideal hot chocolate is defined as "hot chocolate not hot cocoa," made by melting a dark solid chocolate bar into milk with a little sugar and optional additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This method results in a pure chocolate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Ingredients

*   Whole milk: 3 cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
*   Sugar: Start with a scant quarter cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>; up to a total of one cup for a more crowd-pleasing taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   Dark Chocolate: One standard 100g (3.5 oz) bar of 70% cacao is recommended, though a less intense chocolate can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   Salt: A pinch (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   Vanilla Extract: A little drip (optional, but may detract from pure chocolate flavor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   [[stabilizing_hot_chocolate_with_cornstarch | Cornstarch Slurry]] (optional for stabilization): Equal parts cornstarch and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Preparation

1.  Pour 3 cups of whole milk into a pan and set the heat to medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
2.  Add a scant quarter cup of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
3.  Break the chocolate bar into chunks and add them to the pan as the milk begins to heat, allowing it to melt slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
4.  Whisk the mixture continuously to help the chocolate melt evenly and prevent it from overheating and splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
5.  Once a homogeneous texture is achieved, taste the hot chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
6.  Adjust sweetness and flavor by adding more sugar or an optional pinch of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. A small drip of vanilla extract can also be added, though it might reduce the pure chocolate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Stabilization

The primary source of fat in this recipe is cocoa butter, not dairy cream, which gives it a different mouthfeel and can make the mixture unstable, causing the chocolate to fall out of suspension if it sits for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

To stabilize the hot chocolate and achieve a smoother, almost fluffy texture:
*   Make a [[stabilizing_hot_chocolate_with_cornstarch | cornstarch slurry]] using equal parts cornstarch and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Pour about a teaspoon of the slurry into the hot chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   Ensure the hot chocolate is at least simmering to gelatinize the starch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. While this stabilizes the drink and matches common expectations, the texture without cornstarch may be preferred for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Serving Suggestions

Serve the hot chocolate in mugs.
*   **With [[homemade_honey_marshmallows | Homemade Mini Marshmallows]]**: Float a handful of small marshmallows on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Small marshmallows are preferred as they can be easily slurped out or melted into the drink, unlike giant marshmallows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **With Brûléed Marshmallow Disk**: For a more photogenic presentation that is still functional, punch a wide, thin round out of a marshmallow sheet (preferably un-brûléed section) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Float this disk on top of the hot chocolate and torch its surface to brûlée it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The freshly brûléed top creates a crispy, filo-like texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **With Reduced Cream**: For an alternative to marshmallows, reduce cream in a pan until it has a saucy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Add a little sugar and vanilla, then chill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This can then be used to decorate the hot chocolate, for example, by creating patterns with a toothpick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## [[homemade_honey_marshmallows | Homemade Mini Marshmallows]]

[[homemade_honey_marshmallows | Homemade marshmallow]] is highly recommended for its amazing texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The process is best done the night before serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Preparation of Mold

1.  Select a square vessel, such as a loaf pan, for a small batch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
2.  Thoroughly grease the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  Dump an ample pile of powdered sugar (icing sugar) into the greased pan and coat the bottom and insides well. This is crucial for easy removal of the sticky marshmallow later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
4.  Dump out any excess sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Marshmallow Syrup Ingredients

*   Sugar: 1/2 cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   Water: 1/4 cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   Honey: Approximately 1/4 cup, eyeballed (makes honey-flavored marshmallows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Corn syrup can be substituted if a strong honey flavor is not desired. An inverted sugar (honey or corn syrup) is necessary to prevent other sugars from crystallizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Unflavored Gelatin: 1/4 ounce envelope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For a vegan substitute, use 2 teaspoons of agar-agar powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Water (for gelatin): 1/4 cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Vanilla Extract: A few drops (add when marshmallow mixture is warm, not piping hot, to preserve flavor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Marshmallow Preparation

1.  In a saucepan, combine 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water, and about 1/4 cup honey. Heat on high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
2.  In a mixing bowl, combine the unflavored gelatin (or agar-agar) and 1/4 cup water. Let it hydrate for about a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This recipe uses a proportionally large amount of gelatin for firmer marshmallows that don't melt instantaneously in hot chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
3.  As the sugars heat, they will become less viscous and can be mixed by shaking the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Bring to a boil quickly (within 5 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
4.  Cook the syrup to the "soft ball stage," approximately 240°F (115°C). Pushing it a few extra degrees results in firmer marshmallows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
5.  With an electric hand mixer ready and on, slowly drizzle the hot syrup into the bloomed gelatin while continuously beating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Be careful not to splash hot syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
6.  Continue beating until the mixture becomes fluffy and white, with the beaters leaving trails. This typically takes 3-4 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
7.  The marshmallow is ready when it's cool enough to touch but still very warm and pourable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Add a few drops of vanilla extract at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
8.  Quickly pour the marshmallow into the prepared powdered pan. Use a silicone spatula to nudge it into an even layer, working fast before it sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
9.  Optionally, use a kitchen torch to lightly brûlée the surface of the marshmallow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This, combined with the honey, gives the marshmallows a stronger flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
10. Place the marshmallow uncovered in the fridge for at least a few hours, or ideally overnight, to dry out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Cutting and Finishing

1.  Marshmallow is extremely sticky, so work with it in a generous heap of powdered sugar, which often contains cornstarch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
2.  Dust hands with powdered sugar, then peel the marshmallow sheet from the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
3.  Grease a knife and coat it in powdered sugar before cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
4.  Cut the marshmallow into long strips. Toss the cut sides of these strips in powdered sugar to coat them, as they will be incredibly sticky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
5.  Line up the strips and cut them into small, approximately perfect squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
6.  One by one, separate the squares and ensure each piece is fully coated in powdered sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This small batch yields more than enough marshmallows for four portions of hot chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

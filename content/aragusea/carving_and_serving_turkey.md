This article provides an efficient and easy method for carving and serving a classic roast turkey for [[Thanksgiving turkey preparation | Thanksgiving turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The technique optimizes for efficiency and ease of eating, allowing for hot turkey to be served without a time crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Preparing the Turkey for Carving

Before carving, it's crucial to properly remove the turkey from its roasting pan.
*   Use a metal spatula to ensure nothing is stuck to the bottom of the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Insert the spatula into the turkey's cavity and use a clean towel to hold the outside of the bird at the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   Lift the turkey and drain any juices from the cavity back into the pan, as this forms the foundation for [[making_turkey_gravy | gravy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The turkey should be rested, ideally uncovered, for about an hour before slicing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This allows the bird to be handled easily without burning and ensures less juice is spilled when cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Carving the Turkey

Carving can be done with a normal chef's knife, but a long, thin carving knife is highly recommended for cleaner cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. A large cutting board is also very helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### Separating Leg Quarters
1.  Cut the skin between the legs and the breasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
2.  Rather than meticulously negotiating the complex anatomy, rip the leg quarters off the carcass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
3.  Note that the tissue around the hip joint may still appear pink, but it is safe to eat as the thighs reach very high temperatures during cooking, thoroughly pasteurizing the meat in the lower regions of the bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Separating Leg from Thigh
1.  Cut down into the crook between the leg and thigh until you hit bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
2.  Pry them apart to fully expose the joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
3.  Easily see and cut through the small sinew connecting the joint; it should require no force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
4.  Repeat for the other leg quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Removing and Slicing the Breast
1.  To remove the breast, make a cut just to the side of the keel bone in the middle, then lop off the entire breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. It's acceptable to leave some meat on the carcass, as it can be torn off later for leftovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
2.  Once the breasts are off, examine the underside to observe the direction of the meat fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
3.  Slice perpendicular to these fibers for noticeably more tender slices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
4.  Slice the breast very thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
5.  The long, thin carving knife reduces drag and allows for longer motions, resulting in cleaner cuts with less sawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
6.  Arrange the slices so they remain against each other to help keep them warm and prevent evaporation from their cut surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### Preparing Thigh Meat
1.  Turkey thighs are large enough to slice, but it's preferred to tear chunks off with your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
2.  Using hands allows you to feel and separate meat from cartilage and other undesirable bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
3.  Once chunks are separated, line them up and cut them into bite-sized pieces, ensuring to cut against the grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. These chunks, while not always pretty, are easy to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Serving the Turkey

### Keeping the Turkey Hot
*   Use an oven-safe decorative metal serving platter, or a sheet pan if a platter is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   Arrange all the carved meat in big piles on the platter to discourage evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   Place the platter with the meat back into the oven right before you plan to eat, for about 5 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This re-heats the meat and the hot platter helps keep it warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This method removes urgency, allowing dinner to happen whenever sides are ready or family arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Plating
*   A typical plate includes breast slices, sticky dark meat hunks, and a scored leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   Drench everything in [[making_turkey_gravy | gravy]], as it provides moisture and flavor to the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

When preparing a hot chocolate recipe, especially one that uses a high proportion of chocolate and less dairy cream, the mixture can become unstable, causing the chocolate to fall out of suspension if the pot sits around for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. To prevent this separation and create a more consistent texture, [[use_of_xanthan_gum_versus_cornstarch_for_sauce_thickening | cornstarch]] can be used as a stabilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## How to Stabilize

To stabilize [[hot_chocolate_recipe | hot chocolate]] with [[use_of_xanthan_gum_versus_cornstarch_for_sauce_thickening | cornstarch]]:

1.  **Create a Slurry** Make a [[use_of_xanthan_gum_versus_cornstarch_for_sauce_thickening | cornstarch]] slurry by mixing equal parts [[use_of_xanthan_gum_versus_cornstarch_for_sauce_thickening | starch]] and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
2.  **Add to Hot Chocolate** Pour approximately one teaspoon of the slurry into the hot chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
3.  **Heat to Gelatinize** Ensure the hot chocolate is at least verging on a simmer to allow the [[use_of_xanthan_gum_versus_cornstarch_for_sauce_thickening | starch]] to gelatinize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Effects of Cornstarch

Adding [[use_of_xanthan_gum_versus_cornstarch_for_sauce_thickening | cornstarch]] stabilizes the hot chocolate, preventing the chocolate from separating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. It also gives the hot chocolate a smoother, almost fluffy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. While some prefer the texture without the [[use_of_xanthan_gum_versus_cornstarch_for_sauce_thickening | cornstarch]], this stabilized texture is generally closer to what most people expect from hot chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Achieving the desired texture in mac and cheese, particularly during the baking process, involves several key steps from pasta preparation to final resting. The goal is to avoid mushy pasta, dry sauce, or a runny final dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

## Preparing for Baking

*   **Pasta Cooking**
    *   For a pound of [[pasta_choices_for_mac_and_cheese | pasta]], boil water and add salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
    *   Hard boil the [[pasta_choices_for_mac_and_cheese | pasta]] for precisely five minutes, and no more, to prevent it from becoming mushy after baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
    *   Drain the [[pasta_choices_for_mac_and_cheese | pasta]] before assembling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Sauce Consistency**
    *   When assembling the mac and cheese, the sauce should appear "too soupy" at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This ensures it won't be dry and gloppy after baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. The sauce should be nice and smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
*   **Baking Dish Preparation**
    *   Use a baking dish of at least two and a half quarts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
    *   "Lube" or grease the baking dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## Baking Process

*   **Initial Baking (Covered)**
    *   Place the assembled mac and cheese into an oven preheated to 350°F (175°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
    *   Cover the dish for the first 45 minutes of baking. Covering helps the dish cook more evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
    *   *Alternative:* If a "super dry and crispy" top is desired, the dish can be baked uncovered from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Final Baking (Uncovered)**
    *   After 45 minutes, remove the dish from the oven and take off the cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
    *   Continue baking for another half-hour or so, until the top layer of cheese is browned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Achieving Extra Browning**
    *   If the top is not browning sufficiently, the broiler can be used at the very end of the baking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## Post-Baking Rest

*   It is crucial to let the mac and cheese rest for approximately half an hour before serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   This resting period allows the sauce to set; otherwise, it will run out all over the plate when spooned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   The final product is described as having a far smoother texture than mac and cheese made with "real cheese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

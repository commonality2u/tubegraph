Leftover pizza dough can be transformed into quick and delicious fried dinner rolls or a unique dessert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method is a great way to use dough, especially if it has been [[aging_pizza_dough | cold fermented]] for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Fried Dinner Rolls

To prepare fried dinner rolls:
*   **Shape the Dough** Lay out the [[preparing_and_handling_pizza_dough | dough]] and cut it into small rectangles. The specific dimensions are flexible, but remember they will likely double in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Pull them apart to prevent them from merging back together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Alternatively, roll some of the dough into small balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Proofing** Let the shaped dough proof for about 20 or 30 minutes until they are nice and puffy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Frying**
    *   Use a wide pan and add at most half an inch (about 1 centimeter) of olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   Heat the oil to medium at most, as these need very gentle frying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. You want to see some fizzing when the dough is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   Plop the dough pieces into the hot oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   Flip them when the first side is just golden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The key is to avoid burning them; gentle heat is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   If possible, turn them up on their sides to fry evenly, though pale sides can also be a nice textural variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   Once golden and no longer puffing up, cook for another minute to ensure the inside is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Finishing** Remove the fried dough to paper towels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. You can sprinkle salt on them while they are still sticky, though well-seasoned dough might not need it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

These rolls will taste strongly of extra virgin olive oil, offering a crispy yet chewy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Cinnamon Sugar Dessert Bites

Using the same frying method, you can create a unique dessert:
*   **Shape the Dough** For this dessert, shaping the dough into small spherical balls works well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. They don't need perfectly even color all around, unlike traditional donut holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Frying** Follow the same frying instructions as for the dinner rolls, ensuring gentle heat to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Cinnamon Sugar Coating**
    *   Prepare a cinnamon sugar mixture, typically about five parts sugar to one part cinnamon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Place the fried dough (ideally while still warm) into a bowl with paper towels at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   Dump a generous amount of the cinnamon sugar mixture onto the dough, as it is the sole source of sugar for this dessert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   Shake them up to coat thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. A paper lunch bag can also be used to help wick away excess oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The combination of olive oil, cinnamon, and sugar creates a "phenomenal flavor combination" that is more sophisticated than a regular donut and not overly sweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

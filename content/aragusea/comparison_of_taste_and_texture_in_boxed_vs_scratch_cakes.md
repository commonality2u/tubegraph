[[differences_between_boxed_and_scratch_cakes | Boxed cake mixes]] possess characteristics that are difficult to replicate in a home kitchen using conventional ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. An experiment baking the same cake both ways revealed significant differences in the finished baked results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Observed Differences

### Appearance
Boxed cakes often appear smooth and perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, with a very thin and film-like top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. In contrast, scratch cakes may have bubbles, more of a crust, and cracks on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. A true crust is characteristic of a scratch cake, unlike a box cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Texture
*   **Boxed Cakes**: Known for being very soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, fluffy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, and having an incomparable softness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The soft consistency is a significant advantage attributed to science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The goal of a box cake is typically to be light and fluffy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Scratch Cakes**: Not as fluffy as boxed cakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, they tend to have more "body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For certain types of cakes like pound cake, a denser [[texture_and_flavors_of_jiggly_cake | texture]] is desired, which cannot be achieved with a box mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Taste
*   **Boxed Cakes**: Often described as very sweet, sometimes "too sweet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> and can taste like chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Their sweetness helps them keep for longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Scratch Cakes**: Adriana Horton's chocolate scratch cake was described as fuzzier, richer, and more substantial than the chocolate box cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Scientific Basis for Differences

Dr. Rebecca Miller Regan, a professor of bakery science at Kansas State University, explains that the unique qualities of boxed cakes stem from three main factors: emulsifiers, fats, and the type of flour used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### 1. Emulsifiers
Boxed mixes contain high-tech emulsifiers that allow the batter to hold onto more water and oil than a typical scratch cake, leading to a moister [[texture_and_flavors_of_jiggly_cake | texture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. These emulsifiers also enable the batter to hold onto more air bubbles that would otherwise pop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Home bakers typically don't have access to these specific types of emulsifiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. However, egg yolks (containing lecithin) are natural emulsifiers, which is why rich, moist cake recipes often call for extra egg yolks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Some commercial shortenings, like Crisco, also contain emulsifiers like mono- and diglycerides that help stabilize and incorporate more air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### 2. Fats
Boxed cakes include pre-integrated solid fats, specifically shortening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Shortening is favored for its long shelf life and lack of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. To overcome shortening's tendency to break foams (air bubbles), manufacturers use a "cake finisher" to smear the shortening onto flour particles. This ensures enough fat for flavor and soft [[texture_and_flavors_of_jiggly_cake | texture]] without breaking down the incorporated air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### 3. Flour
Box cakes commonly use "high ratio" flour, meaning the cake has more sugar than flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This high sugar content contributes to longer shelf life and structural strength, preventing collapse in multi-layer cakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
The flour in box mixes is typically:
*   **Chlorine-treated**: Chlorine oxidizes the starch in the flour, changing its properties to absorb and hold significantly more water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. These oxidized starches create a strong structural mesh, preventing the cake from collapsing under the weight of sugar or additional layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Finely Milled**: The flour is milled very finely, often through a process called "pin milling," resulting in a silky particle size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This fineness helps the flour gel with water, further enhancing the structural mesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

While chlorinated cake flour can be bought, the formulation in box mixes is precisely designed by food scientists to work synergistically with all other ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Mixing Process
The whipping stage during mixing is crucial for boxed mixes to incorporate air into the batter, which is essential for a cake to rise and achieve a nice crumb grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. [[the_science_of_cake_mixing_and_leavening | Chemical leavening]] agents like [[baking_tips_for_achieving_desired_mac_and_cheese_texture | baking powder]] or [[baking_tips_for_achieving_desired_mac_and_cheese_texture | baking soda]] merely inflate existing air bubbles by producing CO2; they don't create the initial air bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
Unlike scratch cakes, where air bubbles are often created during a [[the_science_of_cake_mixing_and_leavening | creaming]] stage by beating solid fat, boxed mixes have shortening already incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The contents of a box mix are formulated to be whipped extensively without becoming tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Continued mixing of box batter breaks down bubbles into smaller, more numerous ones, resulting in a fine, uniform grain in the final cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Practical Considerations
Professional cake bakers sometimes use boxed cake mixes as a base, adding additional ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Box cakes offer significant time savings in a commercial context due to quick mixing and faster baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. However, some cake styles, like pound cake, are not suitable for box mixes because they are meant to be dense and have a true crust, characteristics not found in box cakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## The Philosophical Angle of "Cheating"
Historically, cake mix manufacturers removed dehydrated eggs from their mixes based on marketing advice, so that housewives would feel less like they were "cheating" by having to add fresh eggs themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The moral opposition to using cake mixes is described as "the feeling of virtue without the substance of virtue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. There is no inherent virtue in making a dessert "the hard way" if the goal is a cake with the characteristics of a box cake (light, fluffy, very sweet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. However, if a different cake style is desired, such as Adriana Horton's richer, more substantial scratch cookies and cream cake, then scratch baking is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Achieving authentic New York-style pizza at home requires careful attention to cheese selection and application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The right combination and preparation are crucial for the desired flavor and texture.

## Mozzarella
For [[mozzarella_cheese_varieties_and_their_impact_on_pizza | New York-style pizza]], the most important mozzarella characteristic is that it should be **whole milk, low moisture mozzarella** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Part-Skim**: If the mozzarella is part-skim, it "won't taste right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Low Moisture is Key**: If it's not low moisture, the pizza will be soggy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

While a block of whole milk, low moisture mozzarella is ideal, string cheese can be used if it meets these specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. For a 12-inch pizza, six ounces (typically six string cheese sticks) is considered the perfect amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Application
It is important to apply the mozzarella evenly across the pizza to ensure it melts and browns correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. When baking, the goal is to brown the cheese without overheating it, which can cause the cheese to separate and ooze an orange grease layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. While some separation is expected, minimizing it is possible by not leaving the pizza in the oven for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Parmesan or Pecorino
A layer of grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese can be added under the mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This practice is considered traditional in higher-quality New York-style pizza establishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Adding this layer significantly improves the pizza's flavor, making it much richer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

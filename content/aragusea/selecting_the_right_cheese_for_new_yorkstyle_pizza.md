One defining characteristic distinguishing New York-style pizza from other varieties, such as [[neapolitan_vs_new_york_style_pizza_cheese_preferences | Neapolitan pizza]], is the choice of cheese: **low-moisture mozzarella** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Why Low-Moisture Mozzarella?

Unlike fresh mozzarella, which can cause the pizza to become "soaked in way" (whey) if too much is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, low-moisture mozzarella allows for a solid, even layer of cheese across the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This prevents the pizza from becoming too wet and maintains the desired texture.

## Preferred Varieties and Characteristics

### Whole Milk vs. Part Skim
While part-skim low-moisture mozzarella is widely available, the **whole-milk version is preferred for its superior taste**, though it can be harder to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Key Characteristics of Good New York-Style Mozzarella
A true low-moisture mozzarella for New York-style pizza should be:
*   **Noticeably drier** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>
*   **Tangier** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, a key flavor component.

### Challenges and Alternatives
*   **Availability**: Finding whole-milk low-moisture mozzarella can be a struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. What was once available in stick form (e.g., Galbani's string cheese) is now often only sold as part-skim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Walmart's Whole Milk Low-Moisture Mozzarella**: This is an option that fits the "right style" though it might not be considered a "great cheese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Medium Moisture" Cheese**: Be wary of cheeses like some retail Palio products, which are closer to "medium moisture" and lack the desired dryness and tanginess compared to true low-moisture varieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Commercial Palio whole milk low-moisture cheese (often sold in 7.5 lb loaves) is a different, more suitable product that might be found at a deli counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Geographic Availability**: Those in larger cities may have more access to quality options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Preparation and Application Tips
*   **Quantity**: Approximately seven ounces of cheese are typically used per home-oven-sized pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Keep it Cold**: After grating, it's crucial to return the mozzarella to the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Keeping the cheese cold helps prevent it from overheating and releasing an "orange grease layer" before it has a chance to brown properly in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Parmesan Base**: Some New York-style pizzerias sprinkle a layer of grated Parmesan cheese under the mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This is believed to add significant flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Even Distribution**: For an even cheese layer, start by sprinkling the mozzarella around the edge of the pizza and then work your way inward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Less is More**: When applying cheese, if it feels like "not quite enough," it's likely "just right" for the thin crust of a New York-style pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

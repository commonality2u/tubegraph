Nougat is a primary component found in nearly every candy bar, alongside caramel, chocolate, and nuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Definition and Structure

Nougat is an aerated confection where air is stabilized by a protein, and its continuous phase is a sugar syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The continuous phase refers to the main structure of the substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In nougat, the continuous phase is a sugar matrix that holds the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, while the dispersed phase is air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. A web of proteins surrounds the air bubbles within this sugar matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This protein is what makes the whipped sugar syrup stable, solid, and either stretchy or bouncy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Dr. Richard Härtel, a professor of food engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, defines it this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

For comparison, in chocolate, the continuous phase is fat (cocoa butter), forming a web of fat molecules with cocoa solids and sugars as dispersed phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## [[factors_affecting_the_texture_of_nougat | Factors Affecting the Texture of Nougat]]

An aerated sugar syrup stabilized with protein describes several confections, including meringue, marshmallow, and divinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | differences between nougat, marshmallow, and meringue]] come down to four main variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>:
*   Air content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   Water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   Kind of sugar used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Kind of protein used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

### Protein Type

Nougat is typically made with egg protein (albumin) and sometimes soy protein (globulin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Marshmallow often includes these but also commonly uses gelatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Gelatin, a protein derived from animal parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, forms complex helices at its junction zones, acting like springs and giving it a squishy, elastic, bouncy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This is why a Jet-Puffed Marshmallow bounces back when pressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. In contrast, nougat, using egg or soy protein, generally stays put when pressed because these proteins (albumin and globulin) form simpler networks that lack this elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Water Content

The water content significantly impacts a confection's softness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Candy makers control water content by boiling syrup to a specific temperature, as syrup cannot reach certain temperatures until a certain amount of water has evaporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

*   **Italian Meringue:** Cooked to about 240°F (115°C), it retains a lot of water, resulting in a soft, spreadable, marshmallow-like product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Nougat:** At Crown Candy, nougat is boiled to 270°F (132°C), leading to a much firmer product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Divinity:** The syrup for divinity is cooked to around 250°F (120°C), making it a softer product than nougat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

The texture is highly sensitive to tiny variations in water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Sugar is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs water from the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This necessitates adjusting boiling temperatures based on humidity to account for water the candy will absorb from the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Meringue cookies, for example, are baked to drive out virtually all water, making them crunchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Sugar Type and Crystallization

The type and state of sugar used significantly influence nougat's texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Crystalline Nougat:** Products like a Three Musketeers bar have partially crystalline sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. When broken, the nougat snaps cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This is achieved by having more sucrose (cane sugar) than corn syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Chewy Nougat:** Confections like a Charleston Chew are chewy and stretch when pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This results from a higher ratio of corn syrup to sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Corn syrup acts as a "doctoring agent" in candy making, inhibiting the formation of sugar crystals by getting between sucrose molecules and preventing them from linking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The more crystallized the nougat, the more brittle or "short" its texture; fewer crystals lead to a chewier texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Sugar can also be "inverted" by breaking sucrose down into monosaccharides using heat or acid (e.g., cream of tartar), which also inhibits crystallization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The size of crystals also matters; a Three Musketeers bar has many small crystals, which can be encouraged by adding powdered sugar as "seed crystals" during the [[nougat_manufacturing_process | nougat manufacturing process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Air Content

The amount of air whipped into a confection significantly alters its texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Marshmallow:** Has a very low density, around 0.3-0.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Nougat:** Is much denser, closer to 0.9-1.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

Changing the aeration level can drastically change the nougat's texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## [[nougat_manufacturing_process | Nougat Manufacturing Process]]

At Crown Candy, a confectionary in Macon, Georgia, nougat is made for their log rolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The process involves:
1.  **Preparation of liquids and solids:** Liquids go into an upper kettle, solids into a bottom kettle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
2.  **Pre-mixing and cooking liquid:** The liquids are pre-mixed, and the liquid mixture is cooked to a specific temperature to remove desired moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
3.  **Combining and whipping:** The cooked liquid is dropped into the solids and mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The solids consist of water, dried egg albumen, a combination of sugars (like fructose and corn syrup), and Frappé (a pre-whipped sugar and egg mixture) to initiate aeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This mixture is fluffed up before the hot syrup is gradually whipped in, which slowly cooks the nougat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
4.  **Cooling and shaping:** The nougat is moved to a table to cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, then placed in an extruder, and a guillotine cuts the logs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
5.  **Curing:** The logs then go into a climate-controlled room to cure or dry out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Role in Candy Bars

Nougat is a common [[key_ingredients_in_nougat | ingredient]] in candy bars because "the more air you can sell, the more money you make" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Air is free, and nougat is full of air, providing free bulk for the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. This allows candy bars like the Three Musketeers to be perceived as bigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Candy making is analogous to bread making, where subtle differences in ingredient types, proportions, and processes yield a vast universe of different products from basic components like flour, water, yeast, and salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Similarly, subtle variations of protein, sugar, water, and air create a wide variety of nougats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

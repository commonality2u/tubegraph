Salad, in the context of dishes like tuna, chicken, or egg salad, refers to a chopped, cold protein bound in a creamy base, typically mayonnaise, flavored with other ingredients, and often eaten as a sandwich filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These types of salads are excellent for preparing in advance and enjoying over several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:92">[09:16:92]</a>.

## Hard-Boiling Eggs for Salad

Properly preparing hard-boiled eggs is crucial for egg salad.

### Boiling Process
*   **Boiling Water Start:** Drop eggs into already boiling water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:47">[02:31:47]</a>. This method seems to help the white separate from the shell more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:65">[02:34:65]</a>.
*   **Optional Additions:** Adding vinegar or salt to the boiling water is sometimes suggested to aid peeling, but it hasn't shown a noticeable difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:18">[02:23:18]</a>.
*   **Cover and Boil:** If an egg cracks, cover the pot to quickly bring the water back to a boil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:64">[02:38:64]</a>. A cracked egg does not affect the final salad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:26">[03:36:26]</a>.
*   **Cooking Time:** An ideal time for hard-boiling eggs is 14 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:64">[02:41:64]</a>.

### Cooling and Peeling
*   **Cooling Method:** Instead of an ice bath, a simpler method is to drain the eggs through the pot lid, place the pot in the sink, and spray them with cool running water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:24">[03:51:24]</a>. The continuous replacement of water cools the eggs quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:71">[03:59:71]</a>.
*   **Peeling Technique:**
    *   Smack the egg all over with the back of a spoon, focusing on the bottom where there's usually a hollow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:37">[04:15:37]</a>.
    *   Flip the spoon around and push the edge up under the shell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:56">[04:21:56]</a>.
    *   Give each peeled egg a rinse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:43">[04:29:43]</a>.
    *   Since eggs will be chopped for salad, it doesn't matter if chunks are taken out during peeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:24">[04:31:24]</a>.

## Achieving Desired Salad Texture

The key to a good salad, whether [[egg_salad_tips_and_techniques | egg]], tuna, or chicken, is to contrast soft, creamy textures with crunchy elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:60">[01:44:60]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:64">[05:25:64]</a>.

### Preparation of Proteins
*   **Egg Salad:** Slice hard-boiled eggs in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:62">[04:37:62]</a>.
    *   Push yolks into a bowl and smash them smooth with mayonnaise and other seasonings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:98">[04:44:98]</a>. This yolk mixture needs to be strong enough in flavor to season the bland egg whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:44">[05:07:44]</a>.
    *   Dice the egg whites and add them to the yolk mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:89">[05:17:89]</a>.
*   **Chicken Salad:** Start with slightly larger chunks of meat, as they will break apart and shred during mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:89">[06:46:89]</a>.

### Incorporating Crunch and Flavor
*   **Onions/Shallots:**
    *   Shallots are a good choice for their mildness, allowing for larger, more plentiful pieces to add crunch without overwhelming the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:10">[05:30:10]</a>.
    *   Green onions also work well for a mild flavor and crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:77">[07:53:77]</a>. The firm white end can be thinly sliced, and progressively bigger pieces used from the greens for color and a fresh herb-like quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:21">[08:01:21]</a>.
*   **Celery:** Adds a good crunch to cold salads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:62">[01:37:62]</a>. Thin slices across the whole stalk provide good texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:22">[01:41:22]</a>. Celery leaves can also be added for flavor and color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:29">[01:48:29]</a>.
*   **Cucumber:** A nice mild taste that won't overshadow the eggs, offering fresh, watery crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:31">[05:36:31]</a>. Leave some peel on for color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:71">[05:42:71]</a>. Cut a half into half, then make three or four radial cuts to create thin, triangular slices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:59">[05:44:59]</a>. Wide pieces provide a satisfying crunchy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:23">[05:53:23]</a>. Note that cucumber can release water overnight in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:46">[06:07:46]</a>.
*   **Nuts:** Any kind of nuts (e.g., pistachios) can add crunch to chicken salad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:67">[08:34:67]</a>. Smash or chop them, but not too finely, to retain texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:27">[08:39:27]</a>.
*   **Mayonnaise/Cream Base:** Start with a conservative amount of mayonnaise as more can always be added later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:83">[00:54:83]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:79">[04:53:79]</a>. Mayonnaise maintains its consistency at different temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:58">[09:06:58]</a>. If using a cream base (like homemade mascarpone alternative), it may stiffen in the fridge and benefit from warming up slightly before eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:59">[09:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:47">[09:11:47]</a>.
*   **Sweet Pickle Relish:** A crucial ingredient, especially in the South, for both tuna and deviled eggs, and makes them "to die for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:88">[04:56:88]</a>.
*   **Other Flavor/Texture Additions:**
    *   Mustard (for deviled eggs, which inspires [[egg_salad_tips_and_techniques | egg salad]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:19">[05:03:19]</a>.
    *   Sweet corn (adds sugar and texture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:03">[08:11:03]</a>.
    *   Fruit like apples or grapes (adds acidity and sweetness, which helps brighten the dish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:05">[08:21:05]</a>. Grapes should be quartered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:34">[08:25:34]</a>.
    *   Garlic powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>.
    *   Parsley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:38">[08:48:38]</a>.

### Serving Suggestions
*   **Bread Toasting:** Lightly toast bread for sandwiches. If the toast is too rigid, it can squeeze the salad out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:58">[06:13:58]</a>.
*   **Rolls:** Egg salad is often easier to eat on small rolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:42">[06:23:42]</a>.
*   **Lettuce and Tomato:** Lettuce is always a nice addition to a sandwich, and tomatoes are also quite good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:36">[02:03:36]</a>.

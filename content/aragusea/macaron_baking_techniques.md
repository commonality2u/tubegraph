From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Macarons are a beloved old-world pastry consisting of two almond meringue cookies sandwiching a filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. They are delicious and naturally gluten-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While notoriously fussy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, home baking them can be sensible given their high cost in bakeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## [[Challenges in Making Macarons | Challenges and Expectations]]

The big challenge in making macarons is achieving perfectly smooth domes arching over ruffled edges known as "macaron feet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. However, the speaker emphasizes that macarons do not have to look perfect; they just have to taste good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. If you "liberate yourself from any precious expectations" about their appearance, they become one of the easiest and cheapest desserts to make at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Meringue cookies are described as possibly "the most forgiving pastry on earth" if you don't get hung up on appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Part of the fun of home cooking is the variety that comes from a handcrafted product, as industrial perfection can be bought from a factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Cracked or otherwise irregular edges can actually become crispier and more caramelized, making them tastier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Ingredient Preparation and Mixing

### Egg Whites
*   **Warmth**: Egg whites are easier to separate and beat up better if they are warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. An easy way to warm them is to leave them in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Separation**: One method is to crack the shell and pass the yolk between the two sides until all the whites ooze out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This method avoids dirtying additional dishes but is risky if the yolk punctures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Measurement**: Due to variable egg sizes, it is crucial to weigh your whites on a gram scale for precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Beating**: Beat the whites until they are just fluffy and foamy, without risking over-beating at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. An electric hand mixer (around $12) is recommended over a stand mixer for more control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Sugar
*   **Type and Quantity**: Use 1/2 cup of normal granulated sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Addition**: Gradually sprinkle in the sugar while beating, although dumping it all in at once makes no difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Beating**: Beat the sugar into the eggs until the mixture is glossy and the beaters leave defined trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This recipe uses more sugar than many, resulting in a "cotton candy-ish melt-in-your-mouth texture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Adjusting sugar content can radically alter proportions, yielding different but still good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Almond Flour
*   **Preparation**: It is often easier to buy almond flour than to make it, as homemade versions can be gritty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. When buying, look for fine almond flour, which can often be visually compared through package windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Almond flour can be stored indefinitely in the freezer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Quantity**: Approximately 3/4 cup is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. More almond flour makes the meringue taste more "cookie-ish," less makes it more "candy-ish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Other Dry Ingredients
*   **Powdered Sugar**: Add an equal quantity to almond flour, about 3/4 cup, precision is not critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Cocoa Powder**: About 1/4 cup is used for a chocolatey flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Natural cocoa is used, but Dutch cocoa creates an "Oreo flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Sifting**: Sifting dry ingredients together does not significantly affect sugar or almond flour but can break up chunks of cocoa powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. However, small chunks in the finished macaron are not necessarily a bad thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Salt**: A few grains of salt are good for chocolate macarons, but care should be taken not to add too much as these are mostly air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Macaronage (Mixing Phase)
*   **Folding**: All dry ingredients can be dumped into the eggs at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Use a spatula to cut down the middle and fold the mixture over itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: Initially, the mixture will feel too dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It will come together; be sure to scrape down the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Stopping Point**: Stop mixing when the batter starts to look like a mousse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Further mixing will loosen the mixture, resulting in a flatter, smoother macaron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The speaker prefers the craggy tops from a thicker batter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Consistency can be tested by dropping a dollop off a spatula and watching how it spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Forming and Baking

### Forming Macarons
*   **Piping vs. Spoon**: While piping bags are useful for making large quantities of perfectly sized and shaped macarons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, a spoon can be used for smaller batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Scoop a spoonful of batter and nudge it off onto parchment paper on a baking sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This method results in less waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Quantity**: This recipe yields 20 cookies for 10 large macaron sandwiches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Drying and Baking
*   **Drying (Resting)**: Macarons can be baked immediately, or they can be left to sit and dry out for about half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Drying them creates a smoother surface and forces the macaron to expand upward in the oven instead of outward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This is a passive step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Oven Temperature**: Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Do not worry about preheating to 425°F and then lowering, or using steam injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Cracking**: If macarons crack, it becomes a good indication that they are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. These took about 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Filling and Maturation

### Ganache Filling
*   **Recipe**: A simple ganache uses equal parts cream and chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Chocolate Choice**: Dark chocolate is preferred to balance the sweetness of the meringues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Sugar can be added if desired, but a bitter chocolate is good for balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Preparation**: Microwave the cream and chocolate until it just starts to bubble, then let it sit and melt before stirring until smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Cooling**: The ganache will be too loose to use immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. It can cool at room temperature for an hour or be cooled faster in the fridge, checking and stirring frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Assembly and Enjoyment
*   **Filling**: Once the meringues are cool and solidified, smear a little filling onto one meringue and sandwich it with another of roughly comparable size and shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Be careful not to overfill, as meringues are insubstantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. It should feel like "not quite enough ganache" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Maturation**: While edible right away, macarons are "ten times better the next day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This allows the meringues to absorb moisture from the filling and air, resulting in a chewy, marshmallowy consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Air Pockets**: The speaker enjoys the "big air pockets" that collapse when bitten into, contrary to some who try to prevent them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Variations**: Macarons made with less sugar have a chewier, brownie-like consistency and are less sweet, pairing well with fillings like marshmallow fluff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

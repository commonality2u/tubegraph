Panko is a type of breadcrumb originally from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Unlike traditional breadcrumbs, panko tends to be much crispier, even when ground into a fine powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This distinct quality stems from a unique [[manufacturing_process_of_panko | peculiar way]] in which the bread for panko is baked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Electrical Baking Method

The bread for panko is baked using electrical current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Metal plates on either side of dough buckets conduct electricity through the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The dough's resistance to this current generates heat, causing the bread to be steam-cooked from the inside out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The electric flow stops once enough water evaporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

This method has several significant effects on the resulting bread:
*   **Lack of Crust** The most obvious effect is the total absence of a crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. When bread is baked conventionally from the outside in, the outer surface dries, heats up, and caramelizes, forming a crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Uniformity and Neutral Flavor** Because there's no crust, panko bread has a totally uniform color and a more neutral flavor, acting as a "blank canvas" for the [[culinary_applications_and_advantages_of_panko | cook]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Light, Airy Crumb** Baking with current creates an extremely light, airy crumb that becomes super [[difference_between_panko_and_traditional_breadcrumbs | crispy]] when dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This unique microstructure is why panko is so much [[difference_between_panko_and_traditional_breadcrumbs | crispier]] than other breadcrumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## The Wartime Invention

The story of how electrocuting dough for bread was conceived traces back to the [[historical_and_cultural_origins_of_the_pork_taboo | Sino-Japanese War]], which eventually became part of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. According to Gary Kawaguchi, president of [[panko_as_a_commercial_product_and_its_market | Upper Crust Enterprises]], a [[panko_as_a_commercial_product_and_its_market | panko manufacturer]], his father shared this unverified but plausible origin story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

During the war, Japanese soldiers in China, facing food shortages, had flour available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. They mixed the flour and connected it to batteries from tanks to bake it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This exemplifies the saying, "necessity is the mother of invention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Historians note that Japan's current affinity for wheat bread products originated during this wartime period due to rice shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Before the 16th century, bread was not popular in Japan, partly because the native wheat yielded small grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Portuguese traders in the 16th century introduced bread and cakes, such as Castella, to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Etymology of "Panko"

The Portuguese traders likely introduced the word "pan" (or "pon" in authentic pronunciation), which means bread in Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. "Ko" means flour, powder, or a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Therefore, "panko" literally means "bread crumbs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The word "pan" itself comes from the Latin *panus* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. While modern Portuguese uses "p√£o," the 16th-century dialect spoken by traders was apparently "pon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. It's also possible the word was introduced by Spanish traders from the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Post-War Popularity and Evolution

After World War II, the newly invented panko, made by shocking dough with tank batteries and then grinding it, became popular in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The post-war industry was further aided by the U.S. providing wheat to Japan through food aid and trade deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Even with the availability of normal ovens, panko manufacturers continued to cook their bread with electrical current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This dedication to the original method ensures the extremely light and airy crumb structure that makes panko exceptionally [[difference_between_panko_and_traditional_breadcrumbs | crispy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

While some contemporary [[manufacturing_process_of_panko | panko producers]] reportedly use microwaves to cook their loaves from the inside out, this method is not as widely recognized within the industry as the traditional electrical current method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

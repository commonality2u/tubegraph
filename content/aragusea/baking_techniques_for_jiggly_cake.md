From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Jiggly cake, often associated with bakeries in Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia, is a large-scale, simple egg sponge cake known as Castella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Its defining characteristic is its "wubba wubba" jiggle when cut, attributed to its soft, pudding-like inner mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This specific version of Castella, without cheese, is more commonly associated with Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Historical Context

Castella was introduced to Japan in the 16th century by Portuguese traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. While modern Japanese versions often include cheese, the "jiggly cake" style appears to be more connected with Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Essential Equipment

Baking this large-scale cake requires specific equipment:
*   **Two Cake Pans:** One for the cake itself (tall-sided, ideally 3 inches/8 cm walls) and a larger one to act as a water bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Disposable aluminum pans can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Large Mixing Bowls:** Two are needed for separating and preparing ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Electric Mixer:** Crucial for achieving the desired fluffy texture of the egg foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Parchment Paper:** Essential for lining the cake pan to prevent sticking and aid in extraction, as sponge cakes are both sticky and delicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Long Knife:** For slicing the finished cake to achieve the characteristic "wubba wubba" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Ingredient Proportions and Preparation

A "mother recipe" proportion is common, based on weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>:
*   **Eggs:** 4 parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. For a 432 square inch pan, 20 large eggs (approx. 1 kg) are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The cake is literally half egg by mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Fat (Oil):** 1 part (e.g., 250g) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Vegetable oil is preferred over melted butter for a softer [[Texture and Flavors of Jiggly Cake | texture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Milk:** 1 part (e.g., 250g) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Flour:** 1 part (e.g., 250g) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Cake flour is generally used to prevent toughness in egg-foam-based cakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Sugar:** Slightly more than 1 part (e.g., 270g) for a glossier top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

**Small Additions:**
*   **Cornstarch:** About a tenth of the flour's weight (e.g., 25g) to make the interior crumb finer and more pudding-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Vanilla Extract:** A generous amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Salt:** Approximately a heaped teaspoon for this quantity (half a gram per egg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Cream of Tartar (or Lemon Juice/White Vinegar):** Added to egg whites to make the foam more elastic and resistant to deflating when mixed with other ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Egg Separation
One of the most critical steps, often a [[Challenges in Baking a Giant Sponge Cake | challenge]], is separating the egg whites from the yolks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Method:** While some bakeries may separate yolks by hand in a large bowl, it carries a high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Caution:** Even a tiny amount of yolk (fat) in the egg whites will prevent them from foaming properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. It is safer to separate each egg individually in a separate bowl to ensure cleanliness before adding to the main batch of whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Mixing and Batter Preparation

### Meringue Formation
*   **Whipping Whites:** Beat the egg whites with cream of tartar until fluffy, but not necessarily stiff peaks initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Sugar Integration:** Gradually add about half the sugar to the egg whites and continue beating until the meringue becomes noticeably firmer and glossier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Adding sugar gradually or at the end helps [[The science of cake mixing and leavening | strengthen the foam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Aim for medium peaks (peaks that flop over) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Beating to stiff peaks with sugar can lead to top cracking during baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Combining Ingredients
*   **Yolk Mixture:** Blend the yolks, oil, milk, flour, cornstarch, vanilla, and salt until very smooth using an electric mixer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Sifting dry ingredients isn't necessary as the mixer will ensure smoothness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Gluten development is not a concern due to the use of cake flour and the small amount of flour relative to egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Folding Meringue:** Stir in the meringue into the yolk mixture in a couple of installments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Despite common baking wisdom, gentle folding isn't strictly necessary for such a large quantity of meringue; mixing until no yellow streaks remain is sufficient. Bakeries often whip these together in a stand mixer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Batter Consistency:** A thinner batter tends to produce a smoother, more attractive cake top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Baking Process

### Pan Preparation
*   **Lining:** Line the pan with parchment paper, allowing excess paper on the sides to be used as a "sling" to lift the cake out later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The weight of the batter will hold the paper in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Water Bath (Bain-Marie)
*   **Purpose:** Baking in a water bath simulates a steam injection oven and is crucial for the cake's unique [[Texture and Flavors of Jiggly Cake | texture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   **Steam Environment:** The steam keeps the cake top from setting up hard, allowing unrestricted upward expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This prevents the top from cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   **Even Cooking:** Water's boiling point (212째F/100째C) is below browning temperature, preventing the cake sides from overcooking and becoming too brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Setup:** Place the cake pan into the larger pan, then pour water into the larger pan. The inner pan might float slightly, which is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The water doesn't need to reach the very top of the inner pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Preheating:** The water bath can be loaded into the oven before it's hot, allowing it to heat up with the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Oven Temperature and Time
*   **Temperature:** 325째F (160째C) is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Convection Fan:** Avoid using a convection fan, as it can cause the cake top to crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Baking Time:** A smaller Castella might take an hour; a large one (toddler bed size) typically requires an hour and a half or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Doneness Check:** Test with a skewer; it should come out clean when done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. If the top browns too quickly, the heat can be lowered; if not browning enough, the heat can be increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Handling and Serving

*   **Cooling in Oven:** After baking, turn off the oven and let the cake cool inside the water bath. There's no need to remove the hot water immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Extraction:** Use the parchment paper sling to lift the cake out of the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Unlike bakery videos where giant cakes are inverted, this size allows for direct lifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Paper Removal:** Remove all parchment paper. Note the light, unbrowned sides, a result of the water bath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Slicing:** Use the longest knife available for a clean cut that highlights the cake's jiggly [[Texture and Flavors of Jiggly Cake | texture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Taste and Texture Notes

While impressive for its springy, pillowy, and jiggly [[Texture and Flavors of Jiggly Cake | texture]], the taste of the cake evolves with cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. When very warm, it may have a sulfuric taste due to the high egg content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This "farty" taste dissipates as the cake cools, resulting in a pleasant flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Flavorings like orange extract or chocolate chips can be added for variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

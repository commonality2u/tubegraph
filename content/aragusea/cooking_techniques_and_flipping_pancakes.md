Cooking pancakes effectively involves managing heat, choosing the right equipment, and mastering the flip to ensure they are cooked through and have a desirable texture.

## Essential [[cooking_techniques | Cooking Techniques]]

### Choosing the Right Pan
Pancakes can be cooked in various vessels, but some are more suitable than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **Nonstick Skillet**: A standard 10-inch nonstick skillet is a widely available and easy option for cooking pancakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Stainless Steel Pan**: While possible, stainless steel pans can lead to sticking, often requiring extra butter and a longer cook time on the first side for a darker color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Flat Square Griddle Pan**: A cheap, flat, square griddle pan is ideal for cooking multiple small pancakes efficiently, especially when feeding multiple people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. Its short rim makes spatula use easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.
*   **Electric Tabletop Griddle**: For making many pancakes at once, a big, wide electric tabletop griddle is the best option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

### Heat Control
The trickiest part of making pancakes is finding and maintaining the right heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Ideal Temperature**: For most pans and stoves, a little south of medium heat is usually perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Testing Pan Temperature**:
    *   **Water Flick Test**: Flicking water into the pan can indicate temperature:
        *   Too cold: Water sits and stares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
        *   Too hot: Water fizzes right out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
        *   Perfect: Water "dances" in the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Butter Test**: Rubbing a stick of butter on the pan is a preferred test. Butter contains water that fizzes at boiling point and milk solids that visibly brown. The ideal time to add batter is when the butter is just barely starting to brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

### Pouring the Batter
*   **Round Pans**: When using a round pan, it acts like a mold, allowing the batter to naturally spread into a tidy circle. Avoid "smooshing" the batter, as this can result in an ugly surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   **Achieving Roundness**: A small measuring cup can help achieve almost perfectly round pancakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. While batter dispensers exist, they typically work best with thinner batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.
*   **Batter Thickness**: The batter will thicken as it sits. If it becomes too thick, a little more milk can be added to loosen it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

### Knowing When to Flip
The key is to wait until the first side is solid enough to flip without falling apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
*   **Bubbles**: The best sign is when bubbles start popping on the surface, indicating the pancake is cooking through. These will form on the edge first and then move to the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   **Matte Finish**: Another good indicator is if the edges of the pancake develop a matte finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

## Flipping Pancakes

### Challenges with Spatulas
*   **Pan Edge Obstruction**: Pans with raised edges make it awkward to get a spatula underneath the pancake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
*   **Spatula Size**: A normal home kitchen spatula is often too small for a 10-inch pancake, causing it to bend and break during flipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. This often forces waiting until the bottom is very solid, which can lead to burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Air Flipping
Many people who make large pancakes in pans resort to air flipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   **Advantages**: Air flipping allows the pancake to be flipped before it's completely solid, preventing it from getting too dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   **Technique**: Do not be hesitant; flick with enough force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

### Flipping Small Pancakes
Small pancakes are significantly easier to cook and flip, eliminating the need for scary air flips or giant spatulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

### Handling Overlapping Batter
If pancakes overlap during cooking, raw batter might get onto the cooked surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. This raw batter will likely steam-cook as the pancake finishes. If concerned, flip the pancake back to its first side briefly before removing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

## Finishing and Serving

### Knowing When Pancakes Are Done
While the outside of a pancake may look cooked when it's no longer liquid, thick, fluffy pancakes can still be raw in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   **Cooking Through**: Cook the pancake until it's outwardly done, then wait another minute. This ensures the center is not gooey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
*   **Resting**: Like a steak, letting a big, thick pancake rest on a cooling rack for a few minutes allows the heat from the outside to continue cooking the interior (carryover cooking), preventing it from becoming dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

### Keeping Pancakes Warm
If cooking pancakes one by one, you can place the cooling rack into a warm oven to keep them warm while you cook others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. Alternatively, cook multiple pancakes simultaneously in multiple pans or on a large griddle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

### Preventing Sogginess
Pulling pancakes out to a cooling rack after cooking is highly effective in preventing sogginess. Steam released from the pancakes will condense on a plate, making them soggy, but a rack allows airflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

### Achieving Even Color
For a more even color, brush excess butter off the cooking surface with a towel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. Often, the second batch of pancakes cooked in the same pan will have a nice, even bronze color due to better fat distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

French bread pizza, often perceived as an "American school lunch abomination," can be transformed into a high-quality dish with proper preparation and technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Originating from school cafeterias, it typically uses a soft white loaf that is cut into "boats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Basic French Bread Pizza Method

The fundamental process involves:
1.  Cutting a soft white loaf into "boats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
2.  Soaking the bread in olive oil, butter, or margarine, possibly with seasoning like garlic bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
3.  Toasting the bread pieces in the oven for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
4.  Adding pizza sauce, cheese, and baking until the cheese is melted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Without proper treatment, the bread can become very dry or super soggy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. A key issue is achieving browned cheese without burning the bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Fully baked bread will burn at the high temperatures required to brown cheese, often resulting in "pallid" cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

A simple trick to allow cheese browning without burning the bread edges is to dab the exposed bread edges liberally with water using a pastry brush just before baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Doing this too far in advance can cause the water to soak too deeply into the bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The water evaporates, allowing the edges to brown nicely without becoming soggy or burnt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Improved French Bread Pizza: The Open-Faced Panini Method

An improved approach re-imagines French bread pizza as an "open-faced panini" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Ingredients & Preparation
*   **Bread**: Use a sandwich-sized ciabatta cut in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Stale bread can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Pan-Frying**:
    *   Heat an oven-safe pan on the stove with a knob of butter over medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Butter is good for flavor and as a temperature indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Olive oil can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   Season the pan, not the bread, with a little salt to fry into the bread surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   Place the cut sides of the bread down to mop up the butter and seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   **Smashing**: Use a flat, heavy object (like a foil-wrapped brick or another pan) to smash the bread down, ensuring thorough browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Cook for a couple of minutes until ready to flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   Flip the bread onto its back sides and add a little olive oil to fry the bottoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Olive oil combined with butter tastes good and is less likely to burn in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   Turn off the heat (electric burners take time to cool; on gas, turn to low) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Topping and Broiling
*   **Sauce**: Use a standard pizza sauce or a preferred alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Herbs**: Place big pieces of fresh herbs, like whole parsley leaves or half basil leaves, on the sauce layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Cheese**: Top with Parmesan and mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. A whole milk, low moisture string cheese is recommended for its convenience and vacuum-sealed packaging, perfect for small portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Water Trick**: Crucially, brush all exposed bread with water before it goes into the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Broiling**: Throw the pizzas under the broiler, watching them closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. They may take only a few minutes, e.g., four minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Cooling**: Cool the finished pizza on a rack so steam can escape, ensuring crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

The result is a crispy, shiny bottom and a satisfyingly dense, panini-like bite due to pressing them flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This makes them easier to eat and provides a more pizza-like experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This method results in a delicious [[pizza_bread_recipe | homemade pizza bread]] that is a significant improvement over the traditional preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Orange & Tomato Sauce with Gremolata
*   **Gremolata**: Combine garlic cloves, orange zest (instead of traditional lemon zest), and parsley. Chop them into each other until the flavors merge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Sauce**: Saut√© roughly chopped shallots in hot olive oil until they start to brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Add high-quality whole canned plum tomatoes, mash them, and cook until they get some color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Deglaze the pan with the juice of the saved orange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Transfer to a narrow vessel, add a couple more nearly raw tomatoes from the can (to prevent the sauce from tasting "too cooked"), and blend with a stick blender until smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Balance the sweetness with chili <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Pancetta Integration
*   Render big chunks of pancetta (or any bacon-like product) in a cold pan over medium heat, stirring until just cooked but not too crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   Pull out most of the pancetta, leaving the fat behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Add a little more olive oil if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   Place the bread, cut side down, in the pan with the remaining meat and fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Smash flat with another pan to embed the pancetta chunks into the bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   Dust with garlic powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   Add sauce, canned Parmesan, cheese, and scatter the remaining pancetta amongst the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   Brush exposed bread with water and broil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   Finish with a sprinkle of gremolata and cool on a rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

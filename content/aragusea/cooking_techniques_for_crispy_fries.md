This recipe aims to produce oven fries so crunchy they emulate deep-fried ones, but with easier preparation and cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The secret lies in a British method of [[cooking techniques | cooking potatoes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Ingredients and Preparation

*   **Potatoes**
    *   Large russet potatoes are recommended, one per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
    *   Peeling is optional but maximizes the starchy surface area for crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
    *   Cut potatoes into desired fry shapes, ensuring roughly equal thickness for even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
    *   Fries will shrink by about half during [[oven_fries_recipe | cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. They should be thick (like steak fries) to prevent breaking with this [[cooking techniques | cooking method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
    *   For an easier and sturdier option, cut potatoes into wedges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## [[oven_fries_recipe | Cooking Techniques]]

The core technique for achieving crispiness is to boil the potatoes first, a method used by the British for their roast potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Par-boiling for Fluffiness and Crispiness

1.  Place cut potatoes into a large saucepan and add just enough water to cover them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
2.  Bring to a boil over high heat, using a lid to speed up the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
3.  Boiling makes the potato pieces fluffy internally and creates a fluffy, starchy exterior that becomes incredibly crispy when roasted in fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
4.  Boil until the potatoes are very delicate and almost appear as if they will fall apart – "as long as you dare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This may take around eight minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
5.  Drain the potatoes by creating a small gap between the pot and the lid, allowing the water to fall out without disturbing the delicate fries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Roasting for Golden Crunch

1.  Gently dump the par-boiled potatoes into a large roasting tray or baking sheet, ensuring they are in more or less one layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Some breakage is expected and will result in extra crispy bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
2.  Pour a generous amount of oil over the potatoes, rather than into the pan first, to ensure they are very well coated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Olive oil adds flavor, but a neutral oil like peanut oil can be used for a more traditional fry taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
3.  Gently shake the tray to distribute the oil and arrange the fries in a single layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The fluffy, beat-up surface on the fries is crucial for extreme crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
4.  Roast in a 450°F (232°C) oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
5.  After about 45 minutes, flip the larger pieces and check for sticking. Add more oil if they appear dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. At this stage, the fries will be more rigid, allowing for more aggressive shaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
6.  Return to the oven for another 45 minutes, or until desired crispiness is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The total [[oven_fries_recipe | cooking]] time will vary based on oven and potato cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
    *   This is mostly unattended [[oven_fries_recipe | cooking]] time, unlike deep-frying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   Be conservative with [[baking_techniques_for_perfect_crust | cooking]] time; over-browning can lead to a slightly burned taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   Fries will firm up considerably as they cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## [[seasoning_and_serving_oven_fries | Seasoning and Serving]]

1.  To drain excess oil, line a large bowl with a towel and dump the hot fries into it. The towel will absorb the oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Remove the towel.
2.  Add a generous amount of coarse salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
3.  For additional flavor, consider adding garlic powder, pepper, chopped cilantro, and grated parmesan cheese. Toss to combine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
4.  The finished fries will have a glassy, crunchy exterior similar to British roast potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Benefits

*   This recipe allows for cooking large batches (e.g., for four people) all at once, unlike conventional deep-fried fries which require small batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Minimal cleanup; no large pot of hot oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   The fries stay hot and crunchy for a surprisingly long time, providing a good 20-minute window after [[cooking techniques | cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Calorie Content
> Despite being oven-baked, these fries are not necessarily less caloric than deep-fried fries due to the amount of oil used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Wagyu literally means "Japanese cattle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While often associated with specific elaborate farming practices, its special nature primarily stems from [[the_history_and_genetics_of_Wagyu_cattle | genetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Japanese cattle, likely due to long-term geographic isolation, possess unusual traits, most notably their capacity for extensive intramuscular fat, known as marbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Wagyu Grading
Japanese Wagyu is graded, with "A5" being the highest quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   "A" indicates the animal yielded more meat than a "B" or "C" carcass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   "5" signifies the highest level of marbling on a one to five scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
A5 Wagyu can be literally about half fat and half meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Historical Context and Production in Japan
The term Wagyu encompasses four main Japanese cattle breeds, though Japanese Black cattle are the most common today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. While the breed's roots are ancient, its characteristic fatty marbling is a result of a change in trade policy in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Response to Trade Liberalization
During the Uruguay Round of World Trade Organization negotiations in 1991, Japan agreed to permit foreign beef imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Fearing competition from countries like the United States, which is naturally suited for inexpensive beef production due to vast grasslands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, Japanese beef producers shifted their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Japan has limited land, much of which is rocky, used for rice cultivation, or urbanized, making widespread grazing difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

To compete on quality rather than price, [[wagyu_beef_production_techniques_and_challenges | Japanese farmers]] adopted new methods:
*   **Breeding:** They focused on producing more steers (castrated males) and heifers (celibate females) instead of bulls and cows, which yields fattier meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Feeding:** Animals were fed significantly more concentrated feeds like corn, as opposed to roughage like rice straw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Most of this grain must be imported, which raises the cost of the beef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Slaughter Age:** Wagyu animals are typically slaughtered older, around 30 months, to achieve fattier meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

These [[wagyu_beef_production_techniques_and_challenges | techniques]], combined with Wagyu's unique [[the_history_and_genetics_of_Wagyu_cattle | genetics]], created the "preposterous beef butter" that suited the traditional Japanese consumption style of small portions with rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Global Authenticity and Production
Kobe beef is a specific type of Wagyu from a particular black cattle strain produced around Kobe, Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Japan did not export any beef until 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Before 2012, if "Kobe" beef was ordered in locations like New York, it was either illegally smuggled or, more commonly, came from cattle raised in the United States with some Wagyu [[the_history_and_genetics_of_Wagyu_cattle | genetics]] in their gene pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Current Global Landscape
Today, producers worldwide are raising Wagyu beef, either purebred or, more commonly, crossbred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Purebred Wagyu calves are in short supply globally and are extremely expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. As a result, purebred Wagyu is scarce outside of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The majority of Wagyu produced outside Japan "ain't the real deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

High-quality Japanese Wagyu, such as A5 grade, can be sourced directly from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. For example, a rib section graded A5 and originating from Kagoshima, Japan, can be acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

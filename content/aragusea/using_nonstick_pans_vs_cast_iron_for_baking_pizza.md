For making [[easy_method_for_making_pan_pizza | pan pizza]], there are distinct differences between using nonstick pans and [[advantages_of_cast_iron_pans | cast iron]] pans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. While [[advantages_of_cast_iron_pans | cast iron]] was previously used, a nonstick pan (specifically a 10-inch Teflon pan with an oven-safe handle) is now preferred due to its ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Advantages of Nonstick Pans

Using a nonstick pan offers several benefits for pan pizza:
*   **Easier Control** The nonstick surface allows for easy lifting of the dough with a soft spatula to check browning during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. It also enables shaking the pan like an omelet to ensure the pizza isn't stuck and to rotate it if some parts are browning unevenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This eliminates guesswork in achieving the desired bottom crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Effortless Removal** After baking, the pizza comes right off the nonstick pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. It can literally be slid out like an omelet, making removal very easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Considerations for Nonstick Pans

While beneficial, there's a common concern regarding the use of Teflon under a [[using_an_oven_broiler_for_pizza | broiler]]:
*   **Potential for Toxic Fumes** It is advised not to put Teflon under a [[using_an_oven_broiler_for_pizza | broiler]] as it could overheat and release toxic fumes, potentially causing polymer fume fever in very high doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Real-World Application and Safety** However, for pan pizza, the nonstick pan is only under the [[using_an_oven_broiler_for_pizza | broiler]] for approximately two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Tests with an infrared thermometer indicate that the exposed Teflon does not reach temperatures where PTFE (Teflon) begins to break down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Alternative for Specific Concerns** If there are concerns about the risk, or if pet birds are present (as they are very sensitive to polymer fumes), using a [[drawbacks_of_cast_iron_pans | cast iron]] pan is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

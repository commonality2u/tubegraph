This article describes a simplified, meatless, and vegan-friendly approach to preparing a Chinese-American style broccoli with garlic sauce, emphasizing particular [[cooking_techniques | cooking techniques]] for broccoli and sauce creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Broccoli is highlighted for its ability to absorb sauce effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Components of the Dish

### Rice Preparation

For fluffy Chinese-style steamed rice, a specific [[rice_cooking_methods | method]] is suggested:
*   Use 100 grams (about half a cup) of rice for two people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Wash and drain the rice multiple times to remove excess starch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Add 1.75 times the rice volume in plain water, without salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   Heat on high, uncovered, until the surface of the rice becomes pockmarked and peaks above the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Cover, reduce heat, and steam for approximately 15 minutes, or until the rest of the meal is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   *Note*: This specific uncovered boiling method may result in drier rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Broccoli Preparation

*   **Selection & Cutting**: Use one medium to large broccoli crown for two servings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Stand the crown upside down to easily cut perfect florets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Cut larger florets into halves or thirds; bigger pieces are preferred as they will shrink slightly during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The stem can be sliced and cooked, or discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Steaming (Preferred Method)**:
    *   Use a steep-sided saut√© pan, soup pot, or Dutch oven with a lid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Add about an inch of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   Utilize an expandable steamer basket for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   Bring water to a boil on high heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   Pile all broccoli into the basket; steam will penetrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   Cover and cook for precisely three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The goal is to cook until just before fork-tender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Boiling (Alternative)**: Broccoli can be boiled instead of steamed if a steamer is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Blanching and Shocking**:
    *   Immediately after steaming, lift the entire basket of broccoli and plunge it into a large bowl of ice water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   Stir until every piece is cooled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
    *   This [[cooking_techniques | technique]] deactivates enzymes that turn green vegetables brown, maintaining a vibrant color and ideal texture, which can be held for hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
    *   Steamed broccoli also tends to have a brighter, fresher flavor compared to stir-fried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Garlic Sauce Preparation

The sauce recipe is designed to be a sweet, glossy Chinese-American restaurant-style garlic sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   **Aromatics**: Peel three to four cloves of garlic and a thumb-sized piece of ginger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Slice ginger across its fibers to make it easier to chop finely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Optionally, add half a fresh chili <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Chop all aromatics finely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Liquid Base**: Use about one cup (240 ml) of water or stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The water used for steaming broccoli can be repurposed as stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Flavorings**:
    *   **Umami & Salty**: A quarter cup (60 ml) of soy sauce is a base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Instead of traditional oyster sauce (which contains oysters) or fish sauce, a large spoonful of Marmite (a vegan yeast extract) can provide umami, B vitamins, and gelatinous texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. MSG (e.g., Accent brand) can be added for extra umami and saltiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   **Sweet**: A tablespoon of white sugar and a "glug" of molasses can replace brown sugar and add desired depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   **Tangy**: Two teaspoons of any tangy mustard can substitute for vinegar and ground mustard seed found in traditional recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   **Other**: A teaspoon of onion powder is optional but nice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. One to two teaspoons of toasted sesame oil should be added at the end, as frying it initially can cause bitterness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Ground pepper and optionally a dash of Chinese five-spice can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Thickener**: Cornstarch or any refined starch, about two tablespoons, mixed into a slurry with cool water until dissolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. It's important to keep the slurry agitated as starch granules will settle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Cooking Process

1.  Heat the pan to medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
2.  Add a little cooking oil and fry the garlic, chili, and ginger for about a minute until soft and slightly golden, before they burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
3.  Pour in the water/stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Add onion powder, soy sauce, mustard, Marmite (or oyster/fish sauce), sugar, molasses, and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
5.  Once the sauce is simmering, continuously stir while drizzling in the cornstarch slurry to prevent lumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. It's better to make the sauce initially thick as it can be thinned later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
6.  Reduce heat to low once thickened, as thick sauce can easily stick and burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
7.  Taste the sauce and adjust seasonings. It should be strong enough to flavor the broccoli and plain rice, meaning it might taste too sweet, sour, salty, or umami on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Add more salt/MSG, mustard/vinegar for acid, or sugar as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
8.  Wring out as much water as possible from the blanched broccoli and add it to the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The broccoli will continue to cook slightly and warm up while getting coated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
9.  If the sauce is too thick, splash in a small amount of water to thin it, while still aiming for a "gloopy" consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Serving

Serve the broccoli and sauce over the prepared rice. Excess sauce can be spooned over the rice for flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Optionally, garnish with whole sesame seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Broccoli, if not overcooked and still retaining a "snap," can be a satisfying main ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

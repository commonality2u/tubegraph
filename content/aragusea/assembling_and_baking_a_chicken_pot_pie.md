A chicken pot pie, or "chicken pie" as referred to by the British, is considered the highest purpose for any leftover roast bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This broad definition of pie, according to the British, can be made into a hearty, delicious dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## [[making_pastry_dough | Pastry Dough]]

The first step in making a chicken pot pie is to [[making_pastry_dough | make some pastry dough]] as it requires chilling before it can be rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Ingredients and Preparation
For the dough, combine the following in a food processor:
*   2 cups of flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   1/2 teaspoon of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   1 stick of cold, salted butter, cut into small chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Cutting the butter prevents it from spinning around in a large glob and ensures it stays hard, creating tiny globs that will lead to a [[tips_for_a_flaky_pie_crust | flaky crust]] when rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Traditionally, cold water is added to bring the dough together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, using white wine (about three or four tablespoons, added a tablespoon at a time) can make the crust sweeter and more fragrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Whisk the mixture until it can be squished into a flake of dough with your fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Forming and Chilling
Dump the dough onto plastic wrap and gently bring it together into a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It might not feel completely right, but the less it is worked at this stage, the more crumbly and flaky the crust will be later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Wrap it up and refrigerate it to chill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## [[preparing_filling_ingredients | Preparing Filling Ingredients]]

### Chicken
Use about half the meat from a 3-4 pound roast chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This can be a homemade roast chicken or a store-bought rotisserie chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Vegetables
The main vegetables for the filling are one pound of carrots and one cauliflower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Purple cauliflower can be used for visual appeal and potential antioxidants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

*   **Carrots**: Peel the carrots, as their skins and "stemy little heads" can be bitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. To cut carrots into even pieces, progressively cut them shorter as they get thicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Cauliflower**: The easiest way to cut cauliflower is to stab and remove the core, which holds the florets together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Cut the florets into big bite-sized pieces, remembering they will shrink slightly when cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Making the Sauce (Roux-based)

1.  Melt a stick of butter in a large pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
2.  Whisk in about a cup of flour to create a roux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. It's advisable to make a bit more roux than you think you'll need and reserve some, in case the sauce needs further thickening later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
3.  Once the roux smells nutty, pull some out to reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
4.  Gradually whisk in half a bottle of white wine, a little at a time, to avoid sloshing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. White wine adds sweetness and acidity, enhancing the flavor beyond traditional b√©chamel (milk-thickened roux) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
5.  Add four cups of milk, whisking it in gradually at first, then in larger doses as the sauce loosens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. If the sauce is too thin, add the reserved roux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
6.  Bring the sauce to a boil, whisking constantly to prevent it from sticking and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. A thick sauce is preferred, as it's easier to thin out later with more milk than to thicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
7.  Add liquid chicken bouillon for flavor, using it as the primary source of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Combining the Filling

1.  Add the carrots to the sauce first, as they take the longest to cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Cooking them in the sauce saves on dishes and keeps their flavor within the pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Switch to a spatula from a whisk to prevent carrots from getting stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
2.  Continue stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
3.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
4.  Cook carrots until they are about half-done (approximately 12 minutes), testing with a fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
5.  Add the cauliflower, which cooks surprisingly fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
6.  Once the cauliflower is half-cooked, add the cut-up roast chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. If the mixture is too thick (or "claggy"), mix in another half cup of milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
7.  Taste the sauce for seasoning. It should taste "too salty" when eaten by itself, as its flavor will be diluted by the vegetables and meat in the final pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Add pepper and more salt as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
8.  Remove the pan from the heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Assembling the Pie

1.  Flour your board and the top of the pastry dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Roll a little, then turn the dough, repeating this process to ensure even rolling and prevent sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
2.  The dough might seem to be breaking apart initially, but as it warms and the butter beads stretch into sheets, it will become more cohesive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. If holes appear, patch them with excess dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Dough that is hard to roll out is a good sign it will be crumbly and flaky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
3.  Roll the dough to have at least an inch of excess on all sides compared to your 2.5 to 3-quart pie dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This excess helps form a seal and creates crunchy edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
4.  Whisk an egg with some water to create an egg wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Use a pastry brush to smear egg wash around the edge of the pie dish to glue the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
5.  At the last possible second, dump a cup of frozen peas into the pie filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This delay helps them thaw and cook in the oven, keeping them green on the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
6.  Pour the filling into the pie dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
7.  Gently drape the pastry on top and quickly brush egg wash over the entire top crust before it melts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This promotes browning and a shiny finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Holes for steam release usually open up naturally during baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Baking

1.  Place the pie in the preheated oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. It's recommended to place aluminum foil or a tray underneath to catch any sauce that boils over or crust pieces that drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
2.  Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Resting and Serving

Flour-thickened sauces thin out when hot and thicken as they cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. To ensure the sauce clings to the veggies and chicken when serving, let the pie rest for at least 10 minutes before cutting into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

The use of white wine in both the sauce and the crust adds a complex flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. A crust that was hard to work with (less "doughy") will yield a desirable crumbly and [[tips_for_a_flaky_pie_crust | flaky crust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Chicken pot pie is considered a great cold-weather dish, feeding many people and bringing comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

This method allows for an unconventional but surprisingly easy way to achieve an [[airsoft_rotisserie_chicken_method | airsoft rotisserie chicken]] at home, resulting in crispy skin and potatoes fried in chicken fat underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This technique is also efficient for cooking multiple chickens at once when feeding a crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Materials Needed
*   **Butcher's Twine:** Approximately three feet (or one meter) per chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **Large Metal S-Hooks:** These can be purchased from a hardware store or bent from a wire coat hanger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Tying the Chicken
Tying the chicken ensures it remains secure during the hanging and [[roasting_chicken_techniques | roasting]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

**Steps:**
1.  **Position the Twine:** Nest the middle of the string underneath the chicken, along its spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
2.  **Bring Up the Breast:** Send one end of the string up along the length of the breast, seating it in the natural depression over the keel bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
3.  **Wrap and Tie Legs:** Wrap the two ends of the string around each other (once or twice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Then, use the excess string to tie the two legs together. It's more secure if one knee joint is laid on top of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. A butcher's knot can be used, but any secure knot is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### Why This Tying Method?
The string wrapping all the way down around the chicken is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Without it, the dark meat can soften as the chicken cooks, causing the bird to literally fall out of its own hip joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

## Hanging the Chicken
Once tied, the chicken is ready to be hung in the oven.

**Steps:**
1.  **Prepare Oven Racks:** Remove one rack if you have three, then place one rack in the top position and one in the bottom position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
2.  **Attach S-Hook:** Hook the large metal S-hook through the chicken's tied legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
3.  **Hang in Oven:** Hook the chicken onto one of the bars in the upper oven rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. A large S-hook helps prevent touching hot racks and burning yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

### Important Note on Hooking
> [!caution] Hook between the legs, not the string.
> It is vital to hook the chicken *between its legs* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. Do *not* hook it onto the string that is suspended over the cavity, as that string is not strong enough and will break in the oven, causing the chicken to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. The legs are a stronger point of suspension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Hanging the Chicken
*   **Crispy Skin:** This method contributes to a very nice crispy skin on the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, especially the underside of the leg and thigh, which is often less crispy with traditional pan [[roasting_chicken_techniques | roasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
*   **Even Cooking:** The tautness created by the hanging helps the dark meat receive more heat and cook faster, addressing the common challenge in [[roasting_chicken_techniques | roasting chickens]] where white meat is often done before dark meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Synergistic Cooking:** The chicken fat drips down onto potatoes placed on a pan below, effectively frying them and creating "bonkers" chicken-flavored potatoes, making it a very efficient home-cooked meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

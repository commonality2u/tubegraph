From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Many popular confections, including [[what_is_nougat_and_its_role_in_candy_bars | nougat]], marshmallow, and meringue, share a fundamental structure: they are aerated confections where air is stabilized by some type of protein, and the continuous phase (main structure) is a sugar syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. According to Dr. Richard Hartel, a professor of food engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the continuous phase in chocolate is fat (cocoa butter), while in [[what_is_nougat_and_its_role_in_candy_bars | nougat]] it is a sugar matrix that holds air bubbles, surrounded by a web of proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This protein network is what makes the whipped sugar syrup stable, solid, and either stretchy or bouncy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

While these confections share a common base, four key variables differentiate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>:
1.  The type of protein used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
2.  Water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
3.  The kind of sugar being used and its state (crystalline or amorphous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
4.  Air content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>

## Key Differentiating Factors

### Protein Type

The primary difference in protein often distinguishes [[what_is_nougat_and_its_role_in_candy_bars | nougat]] and marshmallow:
*   **[[what_is_nougat_and_its_role_in_candy_bars | Nougat]]** is typically made with egg protein (specifically albumin) and sometimes soy protein (globulin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Marshmallow** often contains egg and soy proteins but usually also includes gelatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Gelatin, derived from boiled animal parts, gives marshmallow its characteristic "squishy elastic" and bouncy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This is because gelatin forms complex helical structures at its junction zones, acting like springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. In contrast, albumin and globulin form simpler networks that do not provide the same elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Marshmallow Fluff** (a spreadable product) does not use gelatin; it relies on egg protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Water Content

The amount of water retained in the confection significantly affects its texture:
*   **[[what_is_nougat_and_its_role_in_candy_bars | Nougat]]** generally has a lower water content, leading to a firmer product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. At Crown Candy, a mid-sized confectionery, [[nougat_manufacturing_process | nougat]] syrup is boiled to a high temperature, around 270°F (132°C), to remove more moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Italian Meringue** (and [[homemade_honey_marshmallows | homemade marshmallow fluff]]) has a higher water content, resulting in a softer, spreadable texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The syrup for Italian meringue is typically boiled to about 240°F (115°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Divinity**, a classic Southern treat, is also softer than [[what_is_nougat_and_its_role_in_candy_bars | nougat]] because its syrup is cooked to an intermediate temperature of about 250°F (120°C), retaining more water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Meringue Cookies** are baked to remove almost all water from their outer crust, making them crunchy rather than fluffy or chewy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Candy makers precisely control water content by boiling syrups to specific temperatures; the higher the temperature, the more water has been boiled off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Humidity can even impact this, requiring adjustments to the cooking temperature to account for sugar's hygroscopic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Sugar Type and State

The type and state of sugar heavily influence the texture, particularly chewiness versus brittleness:
*   **Crystallization**: [[factors_affecting_the_texture_of_nougat | Nougat]] can be partially crystalline, like in a Three Musketeers bar, leading to a clean break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Fewer crystals result in a chewier product, such as a Charleston Chew, which stretches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Sugar Ratios**: Candy makers manipulate texture by changing the ratio of sugars, typically cane sugar (sucrose) and corn syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   **Corn Syrup** acts as a "doctoring agent," inhibiting the formation of sugar crystals by getting between sucrose molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
    *   Three Musketeers contains more sugar than corn syrup, while Charleston Chew has more corn syrup than sugar, aligning with their respective textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   Honey can also be used as a sugar alternative, functioning similarly to corn syrup on a molecular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Inversion**: Inverting sugar (breaking sucrose into monosaccharides) with heat or acid (like cream of tartar) also inhibits crystallization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Crystal Size**: The size of crystals matters; Three Musketeers, for instance, has many small crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Adding powdered sugar can create "seed crystals" to control this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Air Content

The amount of air whipped into the confection also dictates its final texture and density:
*   **Density**: Marshmallow has a very low density (e.g., 0.3-0.4 for a Jet-Puffed Marshmallow), indicating a high air content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. [[what_is_nougat_and_its_role_in_candy_bars | Nougat]] is much denser (e.g., 0.9-1.0), meaning it has less air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Texture**: Higher air content leads to a lighter, fluffier texture.
*   **Economic Advantage**: Air is free, so incorporating more air into a product like [[what_is_nougat_and_its_role_in_candy_bars | nougat]] provides "free bulk," making the candy bar appear larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

Like bread making, where subtle differences in ingredients and process yield a vast array of breads, candy making demonstrates how variations in protein, sugar, water, and air can create a universe of different confections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

Pizza dough preparation is crucial for a successful homemade pizza, especially when making stuffed crust. A reliable method can help prevent common issues like leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Dough Characteristics for Stuffed Crust
For stuffed crust pizza, it is beneficial to knead in a little extra flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The dough should be sticky, but only slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A drier dough is generally stronger and less prone to tearing and leaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Quantity Adjustment
When preparing dough for stuffed crust, allocate more dough per pizza than usual to account for wrapping the cheese ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For example, if a recipe normally yields four pizzas from a given amount of dough, consider making three instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Rising Process
Avoid putting olive oil in the bowl where the dough will rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Oil on the dough ball's surface can make it harder to achieve a good seal around the cheese later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

A [[pizza_dough_preparation_and_cold_rise_method | cold rise method]] is recommended, such as two days in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Alternatively, dough can rise for two hours on the counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The cold rise method is preferred as it yields better taste and makes the dough easier to work with when cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Shaping the Dough
When rolling out the dough:
*   Work directly on the counter without flour dusting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This allows the dough to stick, preventing it from snapping back like a rubber band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   Aim for an evenly round shape, slightly wider than your pizza screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Push down hard from the middle and then push outwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Hand stretching is not effective for achieving a thin enough outer ring for stuffed crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Handling Cold Dough
Cold dough is less likely to tear when peeled off the counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Position the dough evenly over the pizza screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Creating the Excess Edge
For stuffed crust, you need a significant amount of very thin excess dough around the edge to fold over and seal the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Roll out the "skirts" of dough hanging over the edge, ensuring they stick to the counter to keep them stretched out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It's crucial to have ample excess dough all the way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If one section is short, you can tear excess dough from another area and graft it on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Sealing the Cheese Ring
After positioning the cheese ring, wet the excess dough with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Then, fold and crimp the dough over the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Folding a lot of excess dough back onto the pizza's interior helps prevent the cheese ring from leaking into the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Abundant excess also means you don't need to stretch the dough so tightly over the cheese, which reduces the risk of tearing and leaking through the outer side or bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Once the crust is seasoned with melted butter and herbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, and everything is greasy, you can firmly press to seal the cheese ring within the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Baking Surface Consideration
Because of the extended preparation time for stuffed crust pizza, it's highly recommended to bake on a pizza screen or directly on parchment paper to prevent the dough from sticking to a wooden or metal peel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

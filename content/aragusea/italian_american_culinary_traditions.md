Spaghetti and meatballs is a dish that embodies Italian-American culture, representing an "edible grief stained white tank top" that is "big, sloppy, loud, and awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This classic recipe, shared from the perspective of an Italian-American upbringing, focuses on achieving specific textures and flavors that differentiate it from more traditional Italian dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Meatball Preparation

The meatballs are prepared similarly to how "grandma ragu" might make them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Ingredients and Mixing

*   **Breadcrumbs**: An essential ingredient that prevents meatballs from becoming "tiny hamburgers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Stale bread can be grated or processed into breadcrumbs, originally a method to convert stale bread into productive use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Approximately 20 grams or 1/3 of a cup is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Milk Soak**: Breadcrumbs are soaked in just enough milk to cover them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Soaking in milk (vs. water) makes a noticeable difference, as milk sugars caramelize on the outside of the meatballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Leaving more milk in the breadcrumbs results in better-tasting, albeit softer, meatballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Cheese**: Pecorino or Parmesan cheese is used for "insane flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Some is grated finely for mixing into the meatballs (~20 grams or 1/3 cup), and more is reserved for topping the pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Fine grated pecorino was traditionally kept in a jelly jar on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Ground Meat**: About a pound of fatty ground meat, such as beef chuck, is preferred for better meatballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Lamb can also be mixed in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Seasonings**:
    *   Garlic powder: Rehydrates in the meat and comes through stronger than fresh garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   Onion powder: Easier and tastes better than fresh onions, which would need to be cooked or pureed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   Black pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   Cayenne: Adds a background flavor, making the meatballs taste fuller without making them spicy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   Salt: At least half a teaspoon, keeping in mind the saltiness of the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **No Egg**: Eggs are considered unnecessary and can make the meatballs rubbery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Mixing Technique**: Overmixing makes meatballs tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Using fingertips to lightly toss the mixture creates a somewhat heterogeneous texture, leaving "fault lines" that allow the meatballs to crumble pleasantly in the mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Seasoning Check**: It's recommended to cook and taste a tiny bit of the mixture (e.g., in the microwave) to adjust seasonings, especially salt, before forming all meatballs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Forming and Browning

*   **Size**: Meatballs are rolled to about a ping-pong ball size, or slightly smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. If too small, they break easily; if too large, there's less browned surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Coating**: Flour coating is avoided as it creates a "slimy texture" after soaking in sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Resting**: Ideally, meatballs should be covered and refrigerated, possibly overnight, to improve flavor and help them hold together during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Browning**: Browned in olive oil in a pan large enough for both meatballs and sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Moderate heat and a hot oil are crucial for a good crust to prevent breaking when flipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Cast-iron or Teflon pans are best for this, though stainless steel can be used for visibility despite potential sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Perfectly round meatballs are often achieved by deep frying, which is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The goal is to brown as much surface area as possible by rolling them around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Sauce Preparation

The sauce is built in the same pan as the meatballs, a departure from [[traditional_versus_modern_methods_for_pasta_dishes | grandma's method]] of cooking them separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This ensures "amazing flavor" from the dissolved meatball fond and rendered beef fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

*   **Tomato Paste**: A large squeeze of tomato paste is fried briefly in the pan to give "incredible instant depth" to the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Crushed Tomatoes**: A high-quality 28-ounce can (~800 grams) of crushed tomatoes is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Deglazing**: The bottom of the pan is deglazed to incorporate all the fond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: A small quantity of tomatoes in a wide pan allows for rapid reduction, creating a very "tight texture" on the tomato sauce for pasta, unlike the "super watery" sauce of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Cook Time**: The sauce cooks quickly, in about the time it takes to boil spaghetti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Stirring**: The sauce needs frequent stirring to prevent sticking and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Cast Iron Use**: A cast-iron pan can be used for the sauce, as iron leaching is minimal and quick cooking prevents issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Finishing the Sauce**: When the pasta is almost done, the heat is turned off, and grated cheese (Pecorino/Parmesan) and fresh herbs (like parsley) are mixed into the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Seasoning is tasted after adding cheese, as it brings additional salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Pasta and Serving

*   **Spaghetti**: Half a pound of spaghetti (~225-250 grams) is boiled in salted water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Breaking Spaghetti**: Spaghetti is broken in half to make it easier to get the desired amount on each forkful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Saucing**: The sauce is added to the pasta pot rather than the other way around to ensure the pasta is not oversauced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This contrasts with the [[traditional_versus_modern_methods_for_pasta_dishes | traditional Italian-American method]] of putting dry pasta on a plate and pouring sauce on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Layering**: Some "heterogeneity" or layering of textures is preserved by undersaucing in the pot, then scooping more sauce and meatballs on top when serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Garnish**: Parsley or basil is placed on the dish first, followed by cheese on top, so the cheese remains white and looks like "fresh fallen snow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Portion Size**: Half a box of pasta with the added bulk of meatballs provides enough food for three or four people, resulting in a higher meat-to-pasta ratio than traditional recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

### Culinary Philosophy

This approach emphasizes a "brighter taste" from a quick-cooked sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The goal for meatballs is a soft, crumbling texture rather than a "rubber ball texture," achieved by careful mixing and not overworking the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

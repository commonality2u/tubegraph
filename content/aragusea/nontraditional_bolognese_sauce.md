This non-traditional Bolognese sauce is part of a multi-day lasagna recipe, specifically prepared on day one of a three-day process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is described as possibly the best thing the creator makes, reserved for special occasions and made in large quantities due to the significant effort involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A full video on this specific sauce is available, but a shorter version of its [[making_bolognese_sauce | preparation]] is provided here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Preparation Steps

1.  Process the pound of carrots and a large red onion in a food processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  Process a pound of [[using_chicken_livers_in_bolognese_sauce | chicken livers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
3.  Fry the processed vegetables in a large Dutch oven, then remove them and set aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
4.  Add three pounds of ground meat to the Dutch oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
5.  Cook the meat on high heat, stirring aggressively with a wooden spoon to break it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Continue cooking for 15 to 20 minutes until the water boils off and the meat fries in its own fat, turning brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
6.  Add the processed [[using_chicken_livers_in_bolognese_sauce | chicken livers]] and a small can of tomato paste to the browned meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
7.  Just as the bottom of the pan appears close to burning, pour in a whole bottle of white wine and scrape the bottom clean to deglaze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
8.  Return the fried vegetables to the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
9.  Add three large cans of crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
10. Optionally, add a big spoonful of liquid chicken bouillon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
11. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for three hours, stirring every now and then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
12. During the last hour of simmering, add some dried herbs, pepper, and a bunch of balsamic vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
13. After three hours, taste the sauce and add salt, more vinegar, or any other seasoning deemed necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Characteristics

*   **Acidity**: This Bolognese recipe is notably acidic, which is believed to help brighten other flavors when used in lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Yield**: The recipe yields about twice the amount needed for the lasagna it's intended for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Storage

After cooking, allow the sauce to cool down and store the entire batch in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The remaining portion can be [[freezing_and_storing_bolognese_sauce | frozen]] for later use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

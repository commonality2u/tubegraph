This article provides a primer on [[basics_of_knife_sharpening_with_whetstones | sharpening kitchen knives with stones]] or "whetstones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The term "whet" (with an 'h') is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning "to sharpen" or "to get something ready" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## Why Sharpen with Whetstones?

While pull-through sharpeners are convenient and can be "good enough for us normals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>, professional chefs generally sharpen with stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. The primary reasons for using whetstones include:
*   **Cool Operation** Stones remain cool, which prevents detempering the blade that can occur with mechanical grinding devices like [[differences_between_pullthrough_sharpeners_and_whetstones | pull-through sharpeners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>. Detempering can make a blade prematurely dull or prevent it from getting truly sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:09">[01:55:09]</a>.
*   **Finer Edge** Stones produce a finer, cleaner edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:10">[02:02:10]</a>.
*   **Minimal Material Removal** They remove less steel than mechanical grinders, preserving the knife's lifespan, especially for expensive knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:34">[02:07:34]</a>.
*   **Total Control** Stones offer total control over the cutting angle, allowing for a very narrow, sharp edge or a wider, tougher edge like an axe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:17">[02:30:17]</a>. They can be used for standard Western double-beveled knives or single-beveled Asian-style knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>.

## Blade Geometry and the Burr

The cross-section of a blade is called its geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:20">[03:22:20]</a>. The goal of sharpening is to make two planes of the blade converge at a point of zero thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:40">[03:28:40]</a>. As metal is ground away, a small piece of metal will shoot past the edge, forming what is known as the "burr" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:17">[03:44:17]</a>.

### Feeling for the Burr
You can safely feel for the burr by pulling your thumb across the blade *perpendicular* to the edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:07">[03:55:07]</a>. If you go parallel, you risk slicing yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:17">[03:59:17]</a>. The burr is often too small to see, even under a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:32">[04:11:32]</a>.

The entire point of sharpening is to create a consistent, even burr along the entire length of the blade, and then to remove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:15">[04:45:15]</a>. This removal happens in the finishing phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

## Blade Profile and Grit Selection

All knife edges are serrated, forming "teeth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:43">[05:29:43]</a>. The size of these teeth is determined by the grit of the stone used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:05">[05:37:05]</a>. A coarser stone with bigger particles cuts bigger, wider teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:48">[05:40:48]</a>. The number on the stone indicates particle size; confusingly, a *bigger* number means a *smaller* particle size and finer grit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:19">[06:04:19]</a>.

[[types_of_whetstones_and_selecting_the_right_grit | Selecting the right grit]] depends on the knife type and desired effect:
*   **Coarse Stone (e.g., 1200 grit)**: Used for the initial phase of cutting a new edge and creating larger teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:59">[06:37:59]</a>. For beginners, avoid super coarse stones that remove too much material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.
*   **Finer Stone**: Used to polish off the burr and align micro-serrations, making the teeth fine enough to shave hair or dice an onion without crying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:04">[06:47:04]</a>.

### Knife Types and Hardness
Knife steel hardness, measured on the Rockwell hardness scale, influences the appropriate finishing grit:
*   **German/European Knives**: Typically 52-58 Rockwell hardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:44">[08:23:44]</a>. Best finished in the 2,000 to 4,000 grit range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:26">[09:00:26]</a>. Finer grits may make the edge feel duller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:38">[09:14:38]</a>.
*   **Japanese/Asian Knives**: Often in the 60s Rockwell hardness, harder than window glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. Harder steel holds a finer, narrower edge with tiny, spiky teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:39">[09:25:39]</a>. These are brittle and require finer finishing stones (6,000-8,000 grit) to avoid knocking off the super fine edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. This is ideal for tasks like preparing raw fish (sashimi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:07">[07:37:07]</a>.
*   **Hybrid East/West Knives**: Popular low-to-mid-market knives that blend Japanese smithing with German/French market needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. They have steel a bit harder than German but not as brittle as super-hard Japanese steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:11">[10:53:11]</a>. A 4,000-6,000 grit finishing stone is perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

## Essential Gear

To begin sharpening with stones, you'll need at least two or three items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>:
1.  **Coarse Stone**: For initial edge cutting.
2.  **Fine Stone**: For polishing and refining the edge.
3.  **Flattening Stone**: Also known as a lapping stone or diamond plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:59">[12:38:59]</a>. This is essential because sharpening removes material from the stone, causing it to become uneven or "dished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. The flattening stone, which must be bigger and harder than your sharpening stones, is used to re-level them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:05">[12:54:05]</a>.

Combo stones (with different grits on each side) exist but are not recommended because they can lead to uneven wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:05">[11:53:05]</a>.

## Preparation

1.  **Wet Your Whetstone**: "Whet stones" (with an 'h') all need to be "wet" (without an 'h') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
    *   **Soaking Stones**: These must be soaked in water until air bubbles stop releasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. Pros sometimes "perma-soak" their stones, changing the water periodically to prevent mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Splash-and-Go Stones**: These are more convenient as they only need to be wet as you use them, but they are generally more expensive and harder, providing less tactile feedback for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.
2.  **Setup**: Place the stone on a damp towel to keep it steady on the counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. Using a loaf pan or sink bridge to raise the stone higher prevents your knuckles from hitting the counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. Keep a bowl of water nearby to keep the stone wet during sharpening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

## Sharpening Technique

### 1. Flatten the Stone
Before starting, use your flattening stone (e.g., diamond plate) to flatten the sharpening stone, ensuring even pressure across the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>. Round off the corners of the stone slightly to prevent chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. Flattening also brings up "mud" or "swarf" (abraded steel and stone particles), which acts as a lubricant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>.

### 2. Grip and Motion
*   **Three-Point Grip**: Your dominant hand is on the handle, thumb on the heel of the knife, and a finger out on the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. The blade initially faces you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.
*   **Fixed Arm, Shoulder Motion**: Your arm from the elbow up should remain fixed, with most motion coming from your shoulder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>. This helps maintain angle control.
*   **Pressure**: Apply pressure with your non-dominant hand (two or three fingers) directly over the stone for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.
*   **Stroke**: Push back and forth, pushing harder on the outward stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>. Gradually draw the knife perpendicularly across the stone to sharpen the entire length of the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.
*   **Tip Sharpening**: As you approach the tip, rotate the knife slightly by lifting your elbow, following its natural curvature (belly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. Keep your wrist fixed to maintain a consistent bevel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>.

### 3. Angles
There are two main angles to consider:

*   **Angle of Blade Face to Stone**: The face of the blade should be at a 15-20 degree angle from the stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. While angle guides exist, beginners are encouraged to go freehand and "feel for what feels natural" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. This natural feeling should reproduce the knife's previous bevel angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.

*   **Angle of Blade Length to Stone**:
    *   **Side 1 (Blade Pointed Towards You)**: Hold the blade at approximately a 45-degree angle relative to the length of the stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. This feels ergonomically natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Side 2 (Blade Pointed Away From You)**: After sharpening the first side until a burr is formed, rotate the knife in your hand so the blade points away from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. The angle of the blade length to the stone should now be approximately 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>. This distinct angle combination theoretically creates more beneficial teeth for cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.

### 4. Progressively Lighter Passes
After establishing the burr on both sides with the coarse stone, repeat the process with progressively fewer passes and lighter pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>. This reduces the burr's width, making less work for the finer stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>. Always keep sharpening symmetrical for double-bevel knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>.

## Finishing and Stropping

1.  **Switch to Fine Stone**: Transition to the finer grit stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>. First, flatten this stone with the diamond plate as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.
2.  **Lighter Pressure**: Use the same sharpening process but with less pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.
3.  **Burr Removal**: Feel for the *absence* of the burr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. Once it's gone, the knife is sharpened.
4.  **Stropping**: The final step is to strop the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. Stropping is a one-way motion, pushing or pulling *opposite* the cutting direction of the edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. This "hones" the blade, getting the tiny micro-teeth standing upright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. There is no need to use a honing steel after stropping on your fine grit stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>.

## Maintenance and Additional Tips

*   **Keep Wet**: Regularly re-wet the stone during sharpening; if it's too dry, the knife won't move smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>. Wetting also removes "swarf" (abraded steel from the knife) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33:00">[21:33:00]</a>.
*   **Stone Size**: Purchase the largest stones you can find, as surface area and mass are important. Thicker stones will last longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>.
*   **Sink Bridge**: An adjustable sink bridge holds the stone over the sink, containing mess and providing a constant water source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:00">[23:14:00]</a>. This [[maintenance_and_care_for_sharpening_stones_and_knives | makes cleanup]] much easier.
*   **Major Flaws**: A diamond plate can also be used to fix major structural flaws in a knife, such as large chips or a dull point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>.

Stone-sharpened knives demonstrate a beautifully polished edge under a microscope, unlike the scratch patterns left by pull-through sharpeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>.

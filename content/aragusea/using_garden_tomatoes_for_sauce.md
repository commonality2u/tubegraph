When garden tomatoes are in season, particularly in the summer, they can be used to create a intensely sweet, smoky, and roasted [[making_homemade_tomato_sauce | homemade tomato sauce]] that is considered worthy of fresh produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This [[roasted_tomato_sauce_recipe | roasted tomato sauce recipe]] highlights the natural flavors of the tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. It's especially useful for [[use_of_fresh_tomatoes_versus_precooked_sauce | fresh tomatoes]] that might have minor imperfections from garden pests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Preparation

The process begins by setting the oven to 450Â°F, ideally with convection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Tomato Preparation
*   **Cleaning and Cutting** Imperfect parts of the tomatoes should be cut away, utilizing the remaining good portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. All tomatoes must be cut at least in half, with larger ones cut into more pieces to achieve roughly equal sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Pan Setup** Place olive oil in a pan, coating the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Arrange the tomato pieces skin side up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It is crucial that each tomato chunk has its own space on the pan to ensure thorough roasting; they should not be piled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This method is not suitable for making large quantities of sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Aromatics Preparation
While the tomatoes are roasting, chop a few cloves of garlic and one or two shallots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. These will be added towards the end of the cooking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Roasting Technique
The tomatoes, arranged skin side up, are placed into the hot oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Initial Roasting
After approximately 30 minutes, the tomato skins will appear burned, which is desirable as they protect the flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The sauce is not yet done if there is still a significant layer of juice at the bottom of the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Secondary Roasting
Continue cooking until the liquid has reduced and started to brown on the bottom of the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This can take an additional 15 minutes, though timing may vary depending on the tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Adding Aromatics
Once the tomatoes are nearly done, add the chopped shallots and garlic to the pan and roast for another four to five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Ensure the bottom of the pan does not go darker than a brown color to avoid burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Finishing the Sauce

### Skin Removal
Remove the burnt skins from the roasted tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Many skins can be lifted off easily, while others, particularly from smaller pieces, might stick but the tomato flesh can often be shaken out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Any stubborn bits of burnt skin can be left as they impart a pleasant smoky note, similar to fire-roasted peppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Mashing and Deglazing
Using a wooden spoon, mash the tomatoes directly in the hot pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Sufficient liquid will be released to deglaze the pan, incorporating the deeply caramelized tomato juice stuck to the bottom with the fresher tomato flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Continue mashing and scraping; any remaining garlic and shallot will continue to cook in the residual heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Seasoning and Optional Additions
Season the sauce with salt and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The sauce can be pureed for a smooth consistency, or left chunky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

An [[optional_ingredients_for_tomato_sauce | optional ingredient]] is a significant amount of butter, melted into the sauce with residual heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Low temperature prevents the butter from separating, creating a thick, glossy emulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This butter addition can give the sauce a flavor similar to an Italian version of Indian butter chicken gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Serving Suggestions

This sauce is excellent for [[making_tomato_sauce_for_pasta | making tomato sauce for pasta]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Torn basil can be added at the last second to keep it fresh and green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. If the sauce seems too thick, some pasta cooking water can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Grated cheese can be added on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

While other additions have been explored, such as roasted carrots or white wine during deglazing, the recipe is generally considered best when allowing the tomatoes to "shine through virtually unadulterated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. It serves as a showcase for the tomatoes, highlighting their range from bright sweetness to deep umami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Incorporating white wine into pie crust dough can significantly enhance its flavor and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Traditionally, [[making_pastry_dough | pastry dough]] would use cold water to bring the ingredients together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, substituting some of that water with white wine can yield superior results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Benefits of Using Wine

Using white wine in the crust makes it "crazy pants good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It imparts a subtle sweetness and a pleasant fragrance to the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The addition of wine also contributes to a more complex flavor profile for the entire pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## How to Incorporate Wine into Pie Crust

When [[making_pastry_dough | making pastry dough]], after combining flour, salt, and cold butter, gradually add white wine instead of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

*   **Addition Method** Pour the wine in about a tablespoon at a time, whisking or processing after each addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Texture Check** Continuously check the dough's texture until it is just right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The dough may look dry but should be squishable into a small flake in your fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Quantity** For a recipe using two cups of flour, approximately three to four tablespoons of wine may be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

After mixing, barely bring the dough together into a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The less the dough is worked, the more crumbly and [[tips_for_a_flaky_pie_crust | flaky the crust]] will be later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This technique, along with the cold butter that forms tiny solid globs, will create a [[tips_for_a_flaky_pie_crust | flaky crust]] when rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. When the dough is difficult to roll, it indicates that it will be crumbly and delicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

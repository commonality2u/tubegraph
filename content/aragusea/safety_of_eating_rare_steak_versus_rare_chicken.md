When it comes to cooking meat, the safety guidelines vary significantly depending on the type of meat and its preparation, explaining why a rare steak is considered safe while rare chicken is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

## Steak and Ground Beef Safety

The primary reason why an intact piece of red meat, such as steak, can be consumed rare is that contamination, like E. coli and Salmonella, typically resides on the surface of the muscle rather than deep within the meat itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:98">[00:44:98]</a>. These bacteria usually live in the animal's digestive system and can transfer to the surface of the carcass during slaughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. Therefore, if the surface of the steak is adequately cooked, it is most likely safe to consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

The situation changes completely with ground beef. In ground beef, the outer parts of the meat that may have been exposed to gut germs in the slaughterhouse are mixed throughout the product, meaning "the outside is on the inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. Because Salmonella and E. coli can be particularly heat-resistant, expert advice recommends cooking ground beef to 160 degrees Fahrenheit to ensure safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a>.

## Chicken Safety

Unlike beef, pathogens like Campylobacter and Salmonella can be internalized within chicken pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:14">[02:04:14]</a>. This means that even if the surface is cooked, dangerous organisms could still be alive inside the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>. Consequently, it is crucial to cook [[cooking_guidelines_for_chicken_to_prevent_foodborne_illness | chicken]] all the way through to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, regardless of whether it's ground or a whole piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:25">[01:55:25]</a>, as this is the recommended standard for all poultry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:50">[02:26:50]</a>.

## Fish Safety (Sushi)

The safety guidelines for fish vary by species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:10">[02:29:10]</a>. While raw fish consumption, as seen with [[sushi_consumption_and_safety_measures_for_raw_fish | sushi]], is common, the number of reported cases of sushi-related illnesses is relatively low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:89">[02:47:89]</a>. One reason for this safety is that a lot of fish intended for raw consumption has been flash-frozen, which can kill pathogens like *Vibrio* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:26">[03:00:26]</a>.

## Pork Safety

Historically, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommended cooking whole cuts of [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | pork]] to 160 degrees Fahrenheit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:47">[03:11:47]</a>. However, in 2011, this guidance was relaxed, and 145 degrees Fahrenheit is now considered sufficient, provided the meat rests for a couple of minutes to allow the internal temperature to rise slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:80">[03:20:80]</a>. This revised temperature results in slightly pink and very tasty pork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:07">[03:33:07]</a>.

The older, more conservative guidance was partly based on concerns about [[cooking_temperatures_and_safety_for_pork_and_the_risk_of_trichinosis | trichinosis]], a parasitic disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:09">[03:38:09]</a>. However, thanks to improved practices in the pork industry, cases of trichinosis are significantly down in the United States, with most current cases linked to wild game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:97">[03:42:97]</a>.

Despite the reduced risk of trichinosis, bacteria like Salmonella can still be an issue with pork, primarily on the outside of the muscle, similar to beef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:23">[03:54:23]</a>. Therefore, while pink pork chops are generally safe, pink sausage is not advisable because the grinding process mixes any surface bacteria throughout the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:21">[04:01:21]</a>.

Integrating a generous quantity of vegetables into a soup transforms it into a nutritious, inexpensive, and sustainable meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:05">[03:07:05]</a>. The chief virtue of a fresh meat stock is its ability to make large quantities of vegetables taste fantastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:05">[03:05:05]</a>.

## General Principles for Vegetables in Soup

*   **Quantity** Aim for at least as much raw weight of vegetables as chicken in your soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Size Matters** Vegetables shrink considerably when cooked, so cut your chunks larger than you desire them to be in the final soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Choice of Vegetables** Any vegetables can be used; the specific ones mentioned below are suggestions, but feel free to customize based on preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

### Incorporating Vegetables

When adding vegetables to the broth, it may initially appear there isn't enough liquid, but a significant amount of water will be released from the vegetables as they cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. You can always add more water later if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

### Seasoning

Begin by adding a couple of large pinches of salt to allow the vegetable pieces to absorb some seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. Be conservative, as more salt can always be added to taste at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. The soup will likely require a significant amount of salt due to the large volume of ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. Pepper is also a common addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

## Specific Vegetable Preparation

### Onions
*   **For Stock**: Use old, shriveled half-onions; do not waste good produce on stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Cut off dirty root tips but keep the onion whole for easy removal later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **For Soup**: Cut small onions in half, peel, and snip off the blossom ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. For visual appeal and slurpability, cut them into small half-moons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. If only flavor is desired with minimal texture, dice them finely by cutting off the root to release the layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### Garlic
*   Cut off the root ends, smash the cloves to release the skin, and chop them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

### Zucchini
*   Zucchini is a good choice for brothy soups as its mucilage helps to thicken the soup slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Okra would achieve an even greater thickening effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Celery
*   Rinse celery ribs thoroughly under the sink to remove dirt hidden between the ribs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   Save the leaves and core as they make an excellent garnish for the finished soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   Slice the ribs for inclusion in the soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

### Carrots
*   You can choose to peel carrots or scrub them clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   Slice them into rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Parsnips
*   Parsnips should be peeled, especially if they are large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   They offer a flavor profile akin to a mix of carrots and potatoes with a strong herbal note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   Cut off the thicker ends and quarter them before slicing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   Thin ends can be sliced directly into rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## Cooking and Finishing Touches

*   **Cooking Time**: Vegetables will typically require at least half an hour of simmering to become soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.
*   **Turmeric**: A common addition to chicken soup for a beautiful golden yellow color and a subtle flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. Many pre-packaged chicken soup or stock products also contain turmeric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   **Fresh Herbs**: Celery leaves (saved from preparation) and parsley can be added at the last minute or directly to the bowl to keep them greener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.
*   **Acidity**: A squeeze of lemon juice or a drop of [[using_wine_or_vinegar_in_vegetable_soup|vinegar]] can be added directly to individual bowls to maintain a fresher flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

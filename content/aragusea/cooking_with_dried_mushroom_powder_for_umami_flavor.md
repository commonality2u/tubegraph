From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Dried mushroom powder is highly effective for imparting an umami boost to sauces and dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[08:30]</a>.

## Why Dried Mushrooms?

Dried mushrooms possess an "incredibly strong" and distinct flavor profile compared to [[conventional_method_of_cooking_mushrooms_with_oil | fresh mushrooms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[09:04]</a>. Using fresh mushrooms, in some applications, can result in an inferior taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[08:35]</a>. Cheap caterers often use dehydrated flavoring products for similar effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[08:40]</a>.

## Sourcing and Preparation

Commercial dehydrated flavoring products that contain [[seasoning_and_flavoring_chicken_soup | salt]], [[seasoning_and_flavoring_chicken_soup | onion powder]], and dried mushroom powder are ideal for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[08:42]</a>.

Alternatively, you can grind dried mushrooms yourself in a spice grinder. While it may be challenging to achieve a powder as fine as commercially processed versions, it is possible to get close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[08:55]</a>.

## Flavor Profile and Application

Dried mushroom powder contributes significant umami. For instance, in a sauce aiming to recreate the "roast beef [[preparation_of_mushroom_jus | au jus]]" served at cheap weddings, a tablespoon or two of dried mushroom powder can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[09:02]</a>. Other flavorings, such as [[seasoning_and_flavoring_chicken_soup | onion powder]] and dried [[seasoning_and_flavoring_chicken_soup | mustard]], can complement it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[09:10]</a>. When used in sufficient quantity, the inherent saltiness of some mushroom powder blends may negate the need for additional [[seasoning_and_flavoring_chicken_soup | salt]] once the sauce is reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[09:20]</a>.

This chocolate chip cookie recipe employs an unusual [[broiling_method_for_cookies|broiling method]] to achieve a specific aesthetic while maintaining a desired texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The base dough is a variation of a familiar recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Dough Preparation

The dough uses several key ingredients and techniques to achieve its desired texture:

*   **Butter**
    *   Two sticks of salted butter are used, melted completely rather than softened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This contributes to a denser, chewier texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Sugar**
    *   Instead of one and a half cups, two full cups of sugar are incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The extra sugar is primarily for texture, making the cookies chewier, rather than for increased sweetness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Molasses**
    *   A "glug" of molasses is added without precise measurement due to its stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This serves as a substitute for keeping brown sugar on hand; mixing it with the other ingredients creates brown sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Vanilla**
    *   A "glug" of vanilla is also added without specific measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Eggs**
    *   Two whole eggs are mixed in until the batter is smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Salt**
    *   Two teaspoons of salt are used, an extra amount that is considered delicious in cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Baking Soda**
    *   One teaspoon of baking soda is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Flour**
    *   [[benefits_of_bread_flour_in_cookies|Bread flour]] is preferred because the high protein content was initially thought to yield a chewier texture. While this effect isn't clear, it does provide a desirable smoother texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
    *   Start with two cups of flour and add more until the desired texture is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Approximately two and a half cups of flour total were used to achieve a dough that looks wet but is not very sticky, pulling away from fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Less flour can be used for thinner cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Chilling the Dough

The dough is refrigerated for at least a half hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This makes the dough easier to work with when cold and prevents it from spreading too thinly during baking, which can be a problem when using melted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Chilling the dough before baking is crucial if using melted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Baking Method: The Broiler Solution

While the dough can be shaped into golf balls and baked conventionally at 375°F (190°C) for about 12 minutes to achieve a slightly underdone, chewy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, this method results in a pale, slightly gray hue that is not aesthetically pleasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The solution involves using a broiler to improve the cookie's appearance without overbaking the center:

1.  **Shape the Dough:** Form the chilled dough into golf balls, then flatten them into "hockey pucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Place them on parchment paper, which prevents sticking and eliminates the need to wash the sheet pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
2.  **Initial Broil:** Place the shaped dough under the broiler until the tops are just golden, which takes about one minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. It's important to remove them before they burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
3.  **Bake:** Turn the oven to its baking mode and allow the broiler a minute to cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Then, return the cookies to the oven for 10 to 12 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
4.  **Visual Cues:** As they bake, cracks will appear in the formerly smooth surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. These cracks are aesthetically pleasing and can be used to judge the cookie's doneness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

This [[broiling_method_for_cookies|broiling method]] results in cookies that look nicer with a cosmetic difference, while still retaining the desired slightly underdone center that is gooey when hot and chewy when cooled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Multiple pans can be broiled in succession and then baked together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

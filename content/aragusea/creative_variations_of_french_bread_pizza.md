French bread pizza, traditionally an American school lunch staple, can be significantly improved upon and creatively varied from its basic form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The original concept typically involves a soft white loaf, olive oil or butter, seasoning, pizza sauce, and cheese, baked until melted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Addressing Common Challenges of Traditional Preparation

The initial preparation of French bread pizza often leads to common issues:
*   **Dryness**: Without soaking enough fat (olive oil, butter, or margarine) into the bread, it can become very dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Sogginess**: Failing to toast the bread pieces in the oven for a few minutes before adding toppings can result in a soggy final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Pallid Cheese**: The bread typically burns at temperatures required to properly brown cheese, often leaving the cheese on French bread pizza looking pallid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

> [!tip] Preventing Burnt Edges
> To prevent the exposed bread edges from burning while allowing the cheese to brown, liberally dab the edges with water using a pastry brush just before placing it in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This slows down the browning of the bread by causing the water to evaporate, resulting in nicely browned, non-soggy edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Reimagining French Bread Pizza: The Panini Approach

Instead of considering French bread pizza as [[pizza_bread_recipe | garlic bread]] with pizza toppings, it can be approached as an "open-faced panini" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This method yields a crispy, satisfyingly dense bite, making it feel more like pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Panini-Style Preparation Using Ciabatta

1.  **Bread Choice**: Use a sandwich-sized ciabatta cut in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. A large, even stale, loaf of bread can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
2.  **Pan-Frying**:
    *   Place an oven-safe pan on the stove over medium heat with a knob of butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Butter is good for flavor and acts as a thermometer when it starts bubbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Olive oil can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   Season the pan with a little salt to fry into the bread surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   Place the cut sides of the bread down to mop up the butter and seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  **Smashing**: Use a flat, heavy object (like a foil-wrapped brick or another pan) to smash the bread down, ensuring thorough browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
4.  **Broiling/Frying**:
    *   Flip the bread onto its back sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
    *   Add a little olive oil to fry the bottoms; it tastes good with butter and is less likely to burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   Turn off the heat (for electric burners) or reduce to low (for gas) while preparing the toppings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   Dust with a little garlic powder if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
5.  **Toppings and Final Bake**:
    *   Add [[innovative_sauce_and_flavor_combinations_for_pizza | sauce]] and toppings (see below) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   Brush all exposed bread with water to protect it under the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   Broil until the cheese is melted and browned (around 4-5 minutes), watching closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   Cool on a rack to maintain crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Standard Sauce and Cheese

*   **Sauce**: A strongly flavored ground tomato sauce, with olive oil, spices, and a pinch of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Cheese**: Whole milk low-moisture string cheese is a favorite for its melt and taste, especially convenient for small French bread pizzas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Standard mozzarella also works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Added Flavor**: Fresh herbs like whole parsley leaves or half basil leaves can be placed on the sauce layer under the cheese to look pretty and add flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. A little canned Parmesan also "tastes right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Creative Sauce: Orange and Tomato

This unique sauce combines the sweetness of orange with the richness of tomato:
1.  **Sauté Shallots**: In a hot pan with olive oil, sauté roughly chopped shallots until they just start to brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
2.  **Add Tomatoes**: Mash in a few high-quality whole canned plum tomatoes and stir until they get some color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
3.  **Deglaze**: When the pan starts to dry, deglaze with the juice of an orange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
4.  **Puree**: Transfer the cooked mixture to a narrow vessel, add a couple more nearly raw tomatoes straight from the can (to prevent the sauce from tasting too cooked), and blend with an immersion blender until smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
5.  **Balance**: Balance the sweetness with some chili <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Gremolata Topping

Gremolata, traditionally made with lemon zest, can be made with orange zest for a twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. It's a combination of garlic cloves, orange zest, and parsley, chopped together so the flavors merge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Sprinkle it on after the pizza has cooled slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Pancetta Addition

To embed browned pancetta (or any bacon-like product) into the bread:
1.  **Render Fat**: In a cold pan, add chunks of pancetta and turn the heat to medium, slowly rendering the fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Stir occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Do not cook them further than slightly browned at this stage to avoid a "bacon bits" texture later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
2.  **Separate and Arrange**: Pull out most of the pancetta, leaving the fat behind. Arrange the remaining meat roughly in the shape of the bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Add a little olive oil if more fat is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
3.  **Smash Bread onto Pancetta**: Place the bread cut-side down onto the pancetta and smash it flat with another pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This embeds the pancetta into the bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
4.  **Top and Bake**: Top with sauce, cheese, and the reserved pancetta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Ensure no cheese rolls off the pan as it will burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Remember to brush the exposed bread with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Broil for about five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
5.  **Cool**: Let it cool on a rack to ensure a flaky, crispy bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

This recipe explores a "lazy version" of Duchess potatoes, a classic catering dish, as a side for roast beef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:54">[03:00:54]</a>.

## Ingredients & Preparation
*   **Potatoes**
    *   Approximately three to four pounds of Yukon Gold potatoes are used, roughly equal in weight to the roast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:54">[03:04:54]</a>.
    *   Yukon Golds are suitable for leaving the skins on, as they are nutritious, taste good, and look appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:48">[03:10:48]</a>.
    *   If using russet or other floury varieties, it's recommended to [[experimentation_with_potato_types_for_rsti | peel them]] because their skins are considered unpleasant when cooked with wet heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:37">[03:15:37]</a>.
    *   Any green spots on potatoes, which indicate the presence of solanine (a natural poison from light exposure), should be trimmed off as they are bitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:25">[03:22:25]</a>.
    *   Potatoes are cut into smaller pieces for faster and more even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:27">[03:39:27]</a>.
    *   They are boiled starting in cold water to avoid splashing when adding them to boiling water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:13">[03:57:13]</a>.
    *   Potatoes are cooked until "fork tender," a visual cue being when the skins start to break off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:01">[04:26:01]</a>.
    *   They can be drained through a gap in the lid of the pot to save dishwasher space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:02">[04:31:02]</a>.
*   **Other Components**
    *   Eight ounces (a quarter kilo) of cheddar cheese, which can be pre-grated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:05">[04:06:05]</a>.
    *   Four egg yolks are separated from the whites; minor imperfections in separation are acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:47">[04:12:47]</a>.
    *   An entire stick of butter (4 ounces / 113 grams) is melted using residual heat from the drained potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:35">[04:39:35]</a>.
    *   Seasoning includes pepper (white pepper is traditional but not necessary), salt, and optionally nutmeg (though the chef dislikes it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:27">[04:46:27]</a>.

## Mashing and Mixing Technique
*   A hand mixer is recommended to achieve a very smooth consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:07">[04:57:07]</a>.
*   Yukon Golds are particularly resistant to becoming gluey, a common issue when whipping other potato varieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:27">[05:00:27]</a>.
*   Instead of cream, butter plus milk is used to achieve the desired texture, which should be slightly stiffer than traditional mashed potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:47">[05:09:47]</a>.
*   Egg yolks are incorporated to add flavor and help the potatoes brown and bind in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:03">[05:27:03]</a>.

## The Experiment and Outcome
*   Traditionally, Duchess potatoes are piped onto a baking sheet into decorative shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:02">[05:32:02]</a>.
*   The experiment involved scooping the potato mixture into a muffin tin, first wiping each cup with melted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:04">[06:10:04]</a>.
*   The mixture was too loose due to an excess of milk, leading to concerns about the potatoes retaining their shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:04">[06:19:04]</a>.
*   The tops were brushed with butter before baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:43">[06:24:43]</a>.
*   After baking for about half an hour at 400°F (200°C), the potatoes did not come out whole due to their loose consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:18">[10:36:18]</a>.
*   Despite the aesthetic failure, the potatoes were described as "awesome" and "super delicious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:57">[11:42:57]</a>.

## Recommendation for Success
*   The chef's recommendation for achieving the desired result is to bake the mixture in one large casserole dish instead of individual muffin tins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:13">[12:20:13]</a>.
*   The resulting dish is likened to a cross between [[advantages_of_mashed_baked_potatoes | baked potatoes and mash]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:01">[12:23:01]</a>.

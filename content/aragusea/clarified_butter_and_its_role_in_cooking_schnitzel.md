Clarified butter is a traditional fat used for frying schnitzel due to its unique properties that prevent burning and bursting at high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Its taste is noted as a dominant flavor in the finished dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## What is Clarified Butter?

Clarified butter is pure butter fat, from which milk proteins, sugars, and water have been removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The absence of these components prevents burning and bursting/popping when cooking at medium-high heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

*   **Butter Schmaltz**: This is the traditional Germanic clarified butter, where the process typically stops once most of the water is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Ghee**: Indian ghee takes an extra step, allowing the butter to brown slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. A jar of ghee can be purchased and used as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## How to Make Clarified Butter

Homemade clarified butter can be made by following these steps:
1.  Place half a pound (or a quarter kilo) of butter into a small saucepan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
2.  Turn the heat to medium-low, allowing the butter to melt and then boil for an extended period, which can take nearly half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
3.  During this process, milk proteins will rise to the top, while sugars and water will sink to the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
4.  The boiling will slow down significantly once most of the water has evaporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
5.  Strain the butter through a strainer lined with a paper towel for thorough separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. It is recommended to strain it twice, especially when transferring it to the frying pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Role in Frying Schnitzel

Clarified butter is considered one of the [[traditional_fats_and_oils_for_frying_schnitzel | traditional fats]] for cooking schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. When frying schnitzel, the meat should be "swimming in the fat," meaning there is enough fat in the pan for the meat to float above the metal surface, but not so much that it is submerged (which would be deep frying) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

To test the temperature of the clarified butter, dip the edge of the meat into the oil; if it sizzles vigorously, it is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The taste of the clarified butter contributes significantly to the final flavor of the schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

While clarified butter is traditional, other [[traditional_fats_and_oils_for_frying_schnitzel | fats and oils]] like [[traditional_fats_and_oils_for_frying_schnitzel | lard]] and neutral vegetable oil can also be used for frying schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

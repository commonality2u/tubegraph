Making fresh pasta, especially for dishes like lasagna, offers a distinct taste compared to dried varieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. While a food processor can simplify the process, it's not strictly necessary for making the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## Ingredients & Preparation

### Yellow Egg Dough

This dough uses more egg than traditional fresh pasta recipes, which helps it remain firm even after baking in a lasagna, preventing it from becoming mushy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

**Ingredients:**
*   4 eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>
*   1 teaspoon salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>
*   2 cups flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>

**Steps:**
1.  Combine eggs, salt, and flour in a food processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
2.  Whizz until the mixture comes together into one giant ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
3.  Transfer the dough onto plastic wrap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. The stickiness of the dough can vary, but this can be adjusted during the rolling process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Green Spinach Dough

This dough incorporates blanched spinach for color and flavor. Seeing small pieces of spinach in the pasta can give the impression of eating a vegetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

**Ingredients:**
*   8 ounces (one bag or half a bin) spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>
*   3 eggs (the spinach provides moisture equivalent to one egg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>
*   1 teaspoon salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>
*   2 cups flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>

**Steps:**
1.  **Prepare Spinach:**
    *   Boil about 8 ounces of spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
    *   Cover it to steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
    *   Prepare a bowl of ice water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
    *   Stir the spinach, and once it's wilted (about 2 minutes of cooking), transfer it to the ice water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
    *   Shocking the spinach in ice water helps set its green color and prevents it from turning brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
    *   Squeeze as much water out of the spinach as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
2.  **Make Dough:**
    *   Place the squeezed spinach in a food processor with three eggs and one teaspoon of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
    *   Whizz initially to chop up the spinach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
    *   Add two cups of flour and whizz until it forms a single large ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
3.  Wrap the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow it to hydrate, preventing it from falling apart when rolled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Rolling the Pasta Dough

A standard 6-inch wide pasta roller, secured with a C-clamp, is effective for rolling pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

**Steps:**
1.  Dust a dough ball with flour to make it easier to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
2.  Cut the dough ball in half (especially recommended for beginners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
3.  Smash the dough into a rectangle and dust it with plenty of flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
4.  Run the dough through the pasta roller on its thickest setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
5.  Fold the dough, dust it, and run it through again multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This process kneads the dough and helps ensure it has the correct amount of flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. If the dough is too wet, it won't roll smoothly; simply add more flour and continue passing it through until it rolls smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
6.  Once the dough is properly kneaded, gradually reduce the thickness setting by one or two clicks at a time, sending the dough through each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
7.  For lasagna, roll the dough down to the second-to-last setting on the pasta roller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. If the pasta is too thin, it may become mushy when baked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
8.  Cut pasta sheets to the length of your baking pan, remembering that they will expand a couple of inches when boiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Kitchen scissors can be used for easy cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. For a 17-inch cutting board, sheets should be cut about 17 inches long and then cut up the middle into two ribbons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## Boiling and Drying Pasta

**Steps:**
1.  Fill the largest available pot with water, add large pinches of salt, and bring to a high boil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
2.  Prepare a giant bowl of ice water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
3.  Lay the pasta ribbons into the boiling water quickly before they stick together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
4.  Boil until they puff up and float aggressively to the top, which takes about 2 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
5.  Immediately transfer the cooked pasta into the cold ice water to stop the cooking process and prevent them from becoming gummy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
6.  Lay out several kitchen towels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
7.  Pull out one noodle at a time, swipe off excess water, and lay them side-by-side on the towels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
8.  Use another towel to dry the top-facing sides of the pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. The pasta doesn't need to be bone-dry, but if it's soaking wet, it can start to dissolve and make the final dish runny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.

### Tips for Efficiency
*   Having a second person can make feeding the dough into the machine much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.
*   More confident cooks can roll out an entire batch of dough at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

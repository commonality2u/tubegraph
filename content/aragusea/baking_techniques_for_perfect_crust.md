This article outlines a reliable method for making pan pizza, a style popularized in the American Midwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While any pizza dough can be used, specific [[bread_baking_techniques|dough preparation]] and [[baking_techniques_for_pizza_at_home|baking methods]] are recommended for optimal results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Dough Ingredients and Preparation

A specific dough recipe is suggested for pan pizzas, though any pizza dough is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Core Ingredients
The recommended dough typically includes:
*   Bread flour (all-purpose flour is also fine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   Salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
*   Sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Dry yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Garlic powder (optional, adds flavor to thick crust pizza) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

### Use of Milk
Instead of water, milk is used in the dough, which contributes to "caramelly notes" in the browned surface of the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Scalding Milk**: Some believe scalding milk (heating it to near boiling) is necessary to deactivate enzymes or proteins that might interfere with gluten and dough rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. However, experiments showed no noticeable difference between using scalded milk and milk straight from the fridge, possibly due to pasteurization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Dough Consistency and Kneading
*   **Wet, Sticky Dough**: Wet, sticky doughs are preferred for pan pizza as they bake up fluffier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **In-Air Kneading**: For small dough portions, kneading "up in the air" between the hands is an easy and clean method, allowing the dough to be squished and ground between the palms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The dough is ready when it is smooth and elastic enough to form a thin sheet without tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### First Rise (Bulk Fermentation)
After kneading, the dough undergoes a first rise, typically for one to two hours, until it doubles in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Alternatively, the dough can be placed directly in the fridge for a slow fermentation over a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Pan Preparation and Dough Shaping

### Pan Choice
A non-stick 10-inch Teflon pan with an oven-safe handle is recommended over cast iron due to ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. If using a broiler, cast iron is a safer alternative to Teflon to avoid potential fumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Oiling and Seasoning the Pan
A small amount of olive oil is used to coat the pan; too much can result in a fried taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Seasonings such as dried oregano, basil, chili flakes, and a pinch of salt can be added to the oil to create a distinct flavor layer on the bottom of the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Dough Shaping in the Pan
Instead of pre-stretching, the dough ball is placed directly into the oiled pan and mashed outwards with fingertips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This technique helps achieve a more even thickness, preventing sauce and cheese from pooling in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The dough should be stretched past the pan's corner, as it will contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. A thin layer of oil is rubbed on top of the dough to prevent drying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Second Rise in the Pan
After shaping, the dough undergoes a second rise in the pan for at least half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This step is crucial for a lighter and fluffier crust; skipping it can result in a dense and doughy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Baking Method

This method focuses on achieving a very brown bottom crust and crispy edges.

### Two-Stage Baking Process
A more energy-efficient and controlled two-stage baking process is used, leading to a browner bottom than traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
1.  **Stovetop Browning**: The pan with the dough is heated on medium heat on the stovetop to brown the bottom of the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The bottom is cooked until it reaches the desired level of browning, even starting to burn a little, which contributes to the pizza flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. A soft spatula or shaking the non-stick pan can be used to check the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
2.  **Broiler Finishing**: Simultaneously, the oven's broiler (grill in British English) is preheated to maximum with a rack positioned close to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Once the bottom is browned, the pizza is topped with sauce (spread edge-to-edge, allowing sauce on the sides to caramelize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>), parmesan (under the mozzarella to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>), and mozzarella (also edge-to-edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>). The pan is then placed under the broiler for about two minutes, or until the cheese is browned to liking and the edges are crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Keeping the oven door closed is said to cook the pizza better and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Bits of cheese touching the pan sides will caramelize into "frico" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Finishing and Serving

### Cooling
After baking, the pizza should cool in the pan for a few minutes until it solidifies enough to be removed intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Transferring it to a cooling rack as soon as possible helps maintain a crispy bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The use of a non-stick pan allows the pizza to slide out easily like an omelet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Re-crisping
If the crust becomes soggy, it can be re-fried in a pan for a few minutes until it sizzles again to bring the crust back to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Cutting
For smaller diameter pizzas, a pizza cutter is suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Small slices are recommended due to the thickness and richness of the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The milk in the crust can make it "a little bit cakey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

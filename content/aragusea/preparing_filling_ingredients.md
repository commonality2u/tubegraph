The filling for a chicken pot pie is a substantial component, typically involving a roast bird, vegetables, and a rich, flavorful sauce. This guide focuses on preparing these elements for an [[assembling_and_baking_a_chicken_pot_pie | assembled pot pie]].

## Main Ingredients

The primary ingredients for the pot pie filling include approximately half the meat from a three to four-pound roast chicken, one pound of carrots, and one cauliflower (a purple variety can be used for visual appeal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Frozen peas are added at the last minute before baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Preparing the Chicken and Vegetables

### Chicken
Use leftover roast chicken, which can be home-roasted or store-bought rotisserie chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Carrots
1.  Peel the carrots, as their skins can be bitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
2.  Cut off the stem ends and raggedy tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
3.  For even cooking, cut carrots progressively shorter as they get thicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
4.  Add carrots to the sauce first, as they take the longest to cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Cook them for about 12 minutes, or until about half done, testing with a fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Cooking them in the sauce saves dishes and retains flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Cauliflower
1.  To easily cut cauliflower, stab into it and cut out the core, which holds the florets together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
2.  Cut the florets into big, bite-sized pieces, remembering they will shrink slightly when cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
3.  Add cauliflower after the carrots are half-cooked, as it cooks surprisingly fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Cook until half-cooked, testing with a fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Peas
Add a cup of frozen peas, frozen solid, into the filling at the very last second before baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This ensures they thaw and cook in the oven, staying green on the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Making the Sauce

### Preparing the Roux
1.  Melt one stick of butter in a large pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
2.  Whisk in about a cup of flour to create a roux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  Make a little more roux than needed and reserve some; this allows for thickening the sauce later if it's too thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
4.  The roux is ready to reserve when it smells nutty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Incorporating Liquids and Seasoning
1.  Gradually whisk in half a bottle of white wine into the roux, a little at a time, to prevent sloshing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The wine adds sweetness and acidity, enhancing the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
2.  Next, gradually whisk in about four cups of milk, starting with small doses and increasing as the sauce loosens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
3.  If the sauce is not thick enough, add the reserved roux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
4.  Bring everything to a boil, whisking constantly to prevent sticking and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   **Tip**: A thick sauce is preferable, as it's easier to thin out later with more milk than to thicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
5.  Add a spoonful of liquid chicken bouillon, which boosts the sauce's flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Account for its high salt content, as it will be the primary source of salt for the pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
6.  Switch to a spatula to stir and scrape the bottom of the pan once carrots are added, as they can get stuck in a whisk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
7.  Adjust thickness with additional milk if the filling becomes too thick or "claggy" after adding chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
8.  Taste the sauce for seasoning when the vegetables are half-cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Add pepper and more salt as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   **Important**: The sauce should taste very salty on its own, as its flavor and saltiness will be diluted by the large chunks of vegetables and meat in each mouthful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Once the filling is seasoned and the vegetables are half-cooked, remove the pan from the heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. It is then ready to be combined with the [[making_pastry_dough | pastry dough]] for [[assembling_and_baking_a_chicken_pot_pie | assembly and baking]].

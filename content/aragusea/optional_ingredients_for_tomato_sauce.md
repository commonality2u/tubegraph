While a [[roasted_tomato_sauce_recipe | roasted tomato sauce recipe]] from [[using_garden_tomatoes_for_sauce | garden tomatoes]] is intended to let the tomatoes "shine through virtually unadulterated," there are a few optional ingredients and variations that can be explored to alter its flavor and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This sauce is designed to showcase the full spectrum of tomato flavor, from bright sweetness to deep umami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Enhancing Flavor and Texture

*   **Butter**: Adding butter is an optional step that can give the sauce a thick, glossy emulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It should be melted into the sauce using the residual heat of the pan to prevent it from separating out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. When used in quantity, it can impart a flavor reminiscent of an Italian version of Indian butter chicken gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Fresh Basil**: Tearing in a little basil at the last second can help keep the sauce fresh and green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Explored Variations

Some ingredients and methods have been tested with varying results:

*   **Roasted Carrots**: Carrots have been roasted with the tomatoes and then mashed into the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **White Wine**: A small amount of white wine can be added at the deglazing stage of the cooking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Whole Roasted Shallots**: An attempt was made to roast shallots whole with the tomatoes, but this resulted in a sauce that was considered too sweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The general recommendation is to keep the recipe simple to allow the natural flavors of the tomatoes to be the focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

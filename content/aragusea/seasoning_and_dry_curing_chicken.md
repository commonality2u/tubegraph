An unconventional but effective method for preparing rotisserie chicken at home involves generous seasoning followed by a dry curing process to enhance both flavor and skin crispness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Seasoning the Chicken

To season the chicken, start with a four to five-pound chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

The recommended spices include:
*   A significant amount of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It should feel like "too much" due to the chicken's large mass relative to its surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   Garlic powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   Paprika, which are considered classic grocery store rotisserie chicken spices in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Black pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Smush the spices all around, then flip the chicken and apply the exact same seasoning to the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It's acceptable if seasoning falls onto the pan below, as that's where potatoes will eventually cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Additionally, stick half a lemon inside each chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Dry Curing Process

While the chicken can be roasted immediately after seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, sticking it uncovered into the fridge for a day or two to [[roasting_chicken_techniques#Dry Cure|dry cure]] is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Placing the chicken on a rack with its bottom up ensures air circulation around it, which helps the skin dry out and become crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. After a day, the skin will appear somewhat leathery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Benefits of Dry Curing

Unlike traditional seasoning, this curing method actually seasons the interior of the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The salt draws moisture to the surface, dissolves into that moisture, and is then slowly reabsorbed into the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This process significantly improves the meat's flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Considerations
While the dry curing phase is entirely optional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, it is beneficial because this cooking method doesn't allow for making gravy or pan sauce, so having the meat flavored on the inside is helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

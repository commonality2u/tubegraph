When preparing mac and cheese, two distinct approaches to sauce creation yield very different results: the classic mornay sauce and a less traditional, yet highly effective, sauce built upon processed American cheese.

## Traditional Mornay Sauce

A traditional mornay sauce, often used for mac and cheese, typically starts with a roux—a mixture of butter and flour cooked together—to which milk is gradually added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Fancy cheeses, such as Gruyère, are then incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While this method is widely recognized, attempts to replicate certain childhood mac and cheese memories using a mornay sauce have sometimes failed to achieve the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Processed American Cheese Sauce

An alternative, championed in some family recipes, utilizes [[benefits_of_using_processed_american_cheese | processed American cheese]] as its base, completely omitting the roux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Key Ingredients

*   **Whole Milk:** One quart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Processed American Cheese:** A whole 16-ounce package of Kraft Deli Deluxe American cheese is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
    *   **Distinction:** Kraft Deli Deluxe differs from Kraft Singles because it contains enough real cheddar or Colby cheese to be legally considered "cheese" by the US government, unlike products labeled "cheese product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Butter:** Between a half and a whole stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Seasoning:** Black pepper is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Salt is generally not needed due to the cheese's salt content, but additional herbs and spices can be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Preparation

1.  Place one quart of whole milk in a large pan over medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
2.  Tear the processed American cheese into pieces to facilitate quick and even melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
3.  Add the torn cheese, butter, and black pepper to the milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
4.  Stir continuously as the cheese slowly melts over 5 to 10 minutes, resulting in a smooth sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The emulsifiers in the processed cheese are believed to enable the sauce to thicken without a roux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Assembly and Baking

This sauce is typically combined with a pound of [[pasta_choices_for_mac_and_cheese | pasta]] (such as large shells) that has been hard-boiled for no more than five minutes to prevent mushiness after baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The mixture should appear "too soupy" at this stage; otherwise, it will be dry and gloppy after baking <a class="yt=" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Baking is done at 350°F (175°C) for 45 minutes covered, followed by another half-hour uncovered until the top layer of cheese browns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A broiler can be used for additional browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The final dish should rest for about half an hour to allow the sauce to set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Comparison and Results

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
> The flavor is stronger and the texture far smoother than mac and cheese made with quote-unquote real cheese.

The processed American cheese sauce yields a much smoother texture and a stronger flavor compared to mac and cheese made with traditional "real cheese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This method results in a consistent and satisfying dish that some find superior to more complex preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

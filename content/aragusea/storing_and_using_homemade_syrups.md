Homemade fruit syrups, which can be made from various fruits like cherries, kumquats, strawberries, blueberries, and pomegranates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22">[02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14">[05:14]</a>, are a versatile ingredient for summertime desserts and beverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13">[01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51">[07:51]</a>.

## Storage
[[making_fruit_syrups_at_home | Fruit syrups]] can be stored in mason jars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18">[02:18]</a> or any other covered container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20">[02:20]</a>. For safety, it is recommended to keep them covered and refrigerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22">[02:22]</a>.

If you need to use the syrup quickly after preparation, the fastest way to cool it down is to place the container in a bowl of ice water, stirring it occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24">[02:24]</a>.

## Using Homemade Syrups

### For Shaved Ice and Snow Cones
Homemade syrups are ideal for flavoring pulverized ice to create treats like snow cones, shaved ice, slushies, raspa, kagegori, or patbingsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00">[00:00]</a>.

When pouring syrup onto shaved ice, aim for what initially looks like "not quite enough" syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54">[02:54]</a>. This is because the syrup will continue to slowly spread through the ice as you eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56">[02:56]</a>. Syrups that have been refrigerated overnight tend to be a little thicker and flow slower, which helps them spread more evenly through the ice instead of just falling to the bottom of the cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36">[07:36]</a>.

For these ice desserts, the syrup itself should taste "way too sweet and way too tart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15">[02:15]</a>. This intense flavor is necessary because the syrup is used to flavor a completely flavorless substance: water ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11">[02:11]</a>.

### Other Culinary Applications
Beyond shaved ice, these syrups are versatile:
*   **Beverages:** Mix them with an equal quantity of club soda to create a "grown-up beverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53">[07:53]</a>.
*   **Breakfast:** Drizzle them on pancakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58">[07:58]</a>.
*   **Frozen Treats:** Dilute them with a bit of water and freeze them as popsicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00">[08:00]</a>.

### Sweetened Condensed Milk Alternative
Some people prefer to use sweetened condensed milk on water ice, or even ice made from milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05">[08:05]</a>. The Korean tradition often involves [[incorporating_fruits_and_other_mixins_into_homemade_ice_cream | adding various garnishes]] to the cup, allowing for different flavor combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14">[08:14]</a>. Compared to more complex desserts like [[homemade_ice_cream_making_techniques | ice cream]], shaved ice desserts are arguably "a lot better suited to the home kitchen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27">[08:27]</a>.

## Safety Note
Be cautious when tasting warm syrup, as it can reach much higher temperatures than water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12">[07:12]</a>. Always blow on the spoon first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15">[07:15]</a>.

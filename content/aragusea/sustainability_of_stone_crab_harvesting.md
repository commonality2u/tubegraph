From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Stone crab harvesting is a unique practice involving the consumption of an animal's parts while the animal remains alive, potentially surviving the experience and even being harvested again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This differs from other animals eaten alive, such as oysters, which die shortly after being shucked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Harvesting Process

Stone crabs are commonly caught in traps off the Florida coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. As there is little usable meat in their central body (carapace), only their giant, meaty claws are harvested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

To harvest a stone crab claw, it must first be measured from the elbow to the tip of the lower immovable portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. If the claw is more than 2 and three-quarter inches in length, it can be removed, and the crab is then returned to the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## [[stone_crabs_and_their_regenerative_abilities | Regenerative Abilities]]

Crabs in the wild frequently [[stone_crabs_and_their_regenerative_abilities | practice autotomy]], meaning they self-amputate their own claws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This biological function, seen in some animals like lizards, is typically a means of predator evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Unlike lizards, which regrow a somewhat inferior tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, crabs can regrow a real, fully functional claw through their molting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Crabs are also able to actively eject their own limb (a reflex action), allowing the break to occur at a specific point where there is a diaphragm that can seal off the wound, preventing fluid loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## [[impact_of_claw_removal_on_crab_survival | Impact of Claw Removal on Crab Survival]]

Historically, fisher folk believed that since crabs deliberately jettison their claws, it was equally harmless to tear them off for consumption, allowing the crab to live and molt again, implying a highly sustainable practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

However, scientific studies have revealed a different picture:

*   **1978 Everglades National Park Study**: Researchers collected 200 healthy stone crabs, removed their claws, and observed them in aquariums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
    *   About half of the crabs that lost both claws died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   About a third of the crabs that lost one claw died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   The majority of deaths occurred within 24 hours due to the trauma of having the claw torn off and subsequent fluid loss (their equivalent of blood) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    *   The study noted that mortality rates would likely be even higher in the wild due to competition for food, mates, and shelter, as well as predator evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

*   **Recent Florida Wildlife Commission Study (2011-2012)**: This study observed crabs in large pens in their natural habitat along the Gulf Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   40% of one-armed crabs died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   60% of no-armed crabs died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   In the control group (crabs that kept their claws), 13% died over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   Losing claws dramatically increased mortality odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   Higher temperatures appeared to further increase the chances of death for declawed crabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

*   **Jessica Hogan's Master's Thesis (University of South Carolina)**: Found that even surviving declawing, crabs struggled in the wild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
    *   They had difficulty cracking open their preferred shellfish for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
    *   Energy that would typically go towards reproduction seemed to be diverted into regrowing the claw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Second Harvest Odds

The likelihood of a second harvest from a stone crab is low. According to a study from South Carolina, only 3% of crabs successfully regrew a claw of legally harvestable size in mark-and-recapture studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This is partly due to the natural lifespan of the crab, which is not long enough for a crab to naturally live to grow two large meaty claws in succession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## [[comparison_between_different_animal_harvesting_practices | Comparison to Other Harvesting Practices]]

While the mortality rates for declawed crabs are significant, they are still better than the 100% mortality rate for animals like beef cattle, which have zero chance of survival after being harvested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Furthermore, if a whole crab (not a stone crab) is cooked and consumed, the meat from the claws is often the easiest to access, and much of the meat in the carapace (body) is not always fully extracted, leading to waste that ends up in landfills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. In contrast, even if a declawed stone crab dies after being returned to the water, its body remains within the ecosystem, becoming food for other creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Proper Claw Removal

Research indicates that stone crabs have a better chance of survival if their claws are removed properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Fisher folk must break the claws along the diaphragm that seals off the wound to ensure the crab's survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The technique involves firmly holding both claws and making a straight downward motion to ensure a clean break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

## Consciousness and Pain

The question of whether crabs experience pain in a way comparable to humans is a subject of ongoing scientific and social controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. While crabs have been observed to recoil from physical danger and avoid situations where they have been harmed, it is uncertain if this is merely an instinct, a reflex, or evidence of consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. In contrast, when harvesting larger-brained animals, modern industrialized meat packing typically attempts to extinguish consciousness before butchering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

To achieve a flavor close to New York-style pizza, making your own sauce is recommended at the same time the dough is mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This [[making_homemade_tomato_sauce | homemade tomato sauce]] is designed to taste better after it sits in the refrigerator for a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>

*   One 28-ounce can of whole plum tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
    *   San Marzano tomatoes from Italy are preferred for their acidity and bright flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
    *   Regardless of the brand, whole tomatoes are typically packed in a liquid, which is often made from lesser-quality tomatoes and can taste bitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. This liquid should be discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   A pinch of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   A "glug" of olive oil, which significantly improves the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   A generous amount of dried oregano, considered the defining herb of New York-style pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   2 to 3 tablespoons of tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Without it, the sauce may not be intense enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
    *   Tomato paste is a heavily cooked and reduced tomato sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
    *   Using too much can spoil the [[use_of_fresh_tomatoes_versus_precooked_sauce | fresh, raw tomato taste]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>

1.  Remove the whole plum tomatoes from their can and discard the packing liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
2.  While the tomatoes can be squished by hand, using a stick blender will achieve a smooth texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
3.  Add the pinch of sugar, olive oil, dried oregano, and 2-3 tablespoons of tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
4.  Stir the ingredients together and add more tomato paste if necessary to achieve the desired thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This recipe yields enough sauce for four 12 to 13-inch pizzas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
5.  Store the sauce in the refrigerator with the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The flavor improves significantly after it sits for a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

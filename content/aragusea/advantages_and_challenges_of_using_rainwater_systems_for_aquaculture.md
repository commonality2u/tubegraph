For those interested in [[setting_up_aquaculture_systems_in_residential_settings | raising fish in home cisterns]], exploring existing structures like old cisterns can provide a unique opportunity. Cisterns, historically used for potable water, offer several benefits for aquaculture, but also present specific challenges related to water quality and oxygenation.

## The Eel Pit: A Case Study
When Nick Tobler and his brother Chris moved into their grandfather's house, Nick discovered a manhole cover in the garage leading to a "huge empty room with water on the floor" [00:34:00]. This underground space was not originally a fish tank but a cistern, a "critical human technology" for collecting rainwater in the absence of municipal water or easily accessible groundwater [00:44:00]. In regions like the southeastern United States, where rain is abundant, gutters direct rainwater into these underground containment areas [01:24:00].

Nick Tobler's cistern, which he calls "the eel pit," is a concrete structure under the garage, estimated to hold about 5,000 to 6,000 gallons of water [01:17:00], [01:28:00]. In contrast, a PVC tank specifically sold for aquaculture typically holds about 300 gallons [01:20:00].

## Advantages of Rainwater Cisterns for Aquaculture

Using a home cistern for [[raising_fish_in_home_cisterns | aquaculture]] offers distinct advantages:

*   **Vast Volume** The sheer size of a cistern provides an "astounding volume of water" [01:15:00]. Nick's "eel pit" holds 5,000-6,000 gallons, significantly more than typical commercial aquaculture tanks [01:17:00].
*   **Water Purity** Rainwater, especially when collected cleanly, can be exceptionally pure [04:45:00]. This clean water is ideal for sensitive fish species.
*   **Temperature Stability** As cisterns are typically underground, the water temperature remains remarkably stable, usually between 40 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit year-round [04:36:00], [07:06:00]. The earth acts as an excellent insulator, which is crucial as most commonly eaten fish are cold-water species that evolve to be bigger in cold water [06:55:00], [06:58:00]. This stability provides a more consistent environment compared to outdoor fish farms where water can get hot in the summer [07:00:00].

## Challenges and Solutions in Cistern Aquaculture

The "biggest challenge with any [[setting_up_aquaculture_systems_in_residential_settings | aquaculture system]] is water quality" [07:12:00]. Keeping a dense mass of fish without them poisoning themselves with ammonia from their waste requires diligent management [07:14:00].

*   **Water Quality Management**
    *   **Water Changes**: Nick primarily manages water quality by pumping dirty water out and allowing clean rainwater to flow back in. If rain is scarce, a garden hose can supplement [07:22:00].
    *   **Filtration**: Water is pumped from the cistern to a plastic tank above ground for acclimating new fish or allowing juveniles to grow [07:42:00]. It then passes through a filter drum containing bioballs [07:50:00]. These bioballs provide surface area for beneficial bacteria to grow, which convert ammonia from fish waste into nitrates, effectively filtering the water [07:53:00], [08:01:00].
*   **Oxygenation**
    *   **Splashing**: The return of filtered water into the cistern is intentionally designed with splashing to oxygenate the water [08:06:00].
    *   **Airstones**: Multiple airstones are also used to provide additional oxygen [08:13:00]. This is critical for fish like sturgeon, which have high oxygen needs and are accustomed to oxygen-rich mountain streams [08:15:00]. In still water, sturgeon must constantly swim to breathe, similar to sharks [08:22:00], [08:23:00].
*   **Limitations on Plant Integration**
    *   Unlike some aquaculture systems, plants are not easily integrated into a cistern like Nick's [08:29:00]. Sturgeon can get caught in plants and drown [08:33:00].
    *   Additionally, in a confined, cold space, rotting plant matter could produce gases that are dangerous [08:37:00].
*   **Substrate Choice**
    *   To prevent gas pockets from building up in the enclosed environment, Nick uses a river rock substrate instead of sand [08:47:00]. Ample gas exchange is necessary when [[raising_fish_in_home_cisterns | raising fish in a cistern]] [08:56:00].

## Species Suitability

The stable, cool, and clean water of a cistern makes it suitable for certain [[species_of_fish_suited_for_home_cistern_environments | species of fish]]. The best food fish for such a setup would likely be trout, which are "delicious and productive freshwater fish that likes the cold" [06:49:00], or catfish [06:43:00], [09:28:00]. Most commonly eaten fish are cold-water species [06:55:00].

Nick's "eel pit" primarily houses sturgeon (including Diamond and Albino Sterlets), gar, and catfish [04:07:00], [04:11:00]. He also keeps rescued blue crabs [06:35:00]. Sturgeon, known for caviar production, require "lots of cool, very clean water like a mountain stream" [04:28:00], which cisterns can provide [04:31:00]. While he has other pets, Nick does not plan to eat the fish in his cistern; they are his pets, and he has named all of them [04:03:00], [06:09:00], [06:12:00]. Notably, harvesting sturgeon eggs for caviar generally results in the fish's death [06:16:00].

Historically, cisterns have been used to keep fish for thousands of years, as exemplified by the famous cisterns of Constantinople (modern Istanbul), where legend says Byzantines kept fish as an early warning system against water poisoning [09:07:00].

While often enjoyed on their own, certain steaks can be greatly enhanced by complementary sauces.

## Chimichurri

Chimichurri is a common South American sauce, often described as a type of pesto, that pairs well with steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51">[04:51]</a>.

### Ingredients and Preparation
Chimichurri typically includes:
*   **Garlic** Use only a couple of cloves, as raw garlic is significantly stronger than cooked garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55">[04:55]</a>.
*   **Fresh Herbs** Traditional recipes call for parsley and oregano, but alternatives like parsley and cilantro can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02">[05:02]</a>.
*   **Chili** Many recipes include a fresh red chili, though dried chili can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24">[05:24]</a>.
*   **Seasoning** A pinch of salt and a little pepper are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28">[05:28]</a>.
*   **Olive Oil** Enough good quality olive oil to form a sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30">[05:30]</a>.
*   **Acid** A splash of red wine vinegar is traditional, but lime juice is another option. Chimichurri is not a vinaigrette and only requires a small amount of acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33">[05:33]</a>.

The ingredients should be chopped as finely as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12">[05:12]</a>. While some use a food processor, adding olive oil to a food processor can make it bitter, so hand-chopping is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15">[05:15]</a>. If too much salt is added, it can be diluted with more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45">[05:45]</a>. The flavors will merge more completely after sitting for a few hours or overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52">[05:52]</a>.

When serving, spoon a small amount over the steak, as it is very strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56">[05:56]</a>.

## Pan Sauces

Pan sauces are less common for steak compared to pork or chicken for two main reasons:
1.  Good beef has a strong flavor and doesn't always need additional sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41">[15:41]</a>.
2.  Achieving a good sear on thin steaks often burns the fond in the pan, which would negatively impact the flavor of a sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47">[15:47]</a>.

However, pan sauces work well with thicker cuts like hanger steak "loins" which can be cooked more gently without burning the fond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57">[15:57]</a>.

### Preparation for Thicker Cuts
1.  **Cook the Meat:** Cook thicker cuts over medium-low heat, frequently rolling or flipping them until a decent crust forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01">[16:01]</a>.
2.  **Butter Basting:** After the crust develops, continuously flip the meat in butter, creating a roasting environment that helps cook thicker pieces through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16">[16:16]</a>.
3.  **Rest the Meat:** Once cooked to desired doneness, rest the meat on a cutting board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50">[16:50]</a>.

### Pan Sauce Method
1.  **Sauté Shallots:** Chop shallots finely, as their thin layers cook quickly. Sauté them in the pan until brown and soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06">[17:06]</a>.
2.  **Deglaze:** Deglaze the pan with red wine, scraping the fond with a wooden spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18">[17:18]</a>. If wine is not preferred, water followed by a splash of balsamic vinegar can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25">[17:25]</a>.
3.  **Add Demi-Glace:** Incorporate homemade demi-glace (made from beef and chicken wings) if available for added richness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31">[17:31]</a>.
4.  **Adjust Consistency:** If the sauce becomes too reduced or bitter, add water instead of more wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46">[17:46]</a>.
5.  **Emulsify with Butter:** Turn off the heat. Once bubbling subsides, stir in butter. If not using demi-glace, double the amount of butter. Mixing butter into the sauce off the boil will create a thick, luscious emulsion; boiling the sauce with butter will cause it to separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54">[17:54]</a>.
6.  **Add Meat Juices:** Pour any juices from the resting meat into the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17">[18:17]</a>.
7.  **Garnish (Optional):** Tear some parsley into the sauce at the last second; the residual heat will wilt it without browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23">[18:23]</a>.

The coarse grain structure of cuts like hanger steak provides ridges that allow the sauce to cling effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30">[18:30]</a>.

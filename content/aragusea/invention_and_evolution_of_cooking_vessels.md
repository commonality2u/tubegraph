The [[historical_evolution_of_human_diet_and_cooking | historical evolution of human diet and cooking]] initially involved [[early_methods_of_cooking_and_roasting | roasting]], where food was directly exposed to fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Early human ancestors like *Homo erectus* would cook by "jamming it straight into the fire at the end of a stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Invention of Wet Cooking and Stone Boiling
For tens of thousands of years, there was no soup, stew, or other wet cooking methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The "epiphany" of wet cooking, often referred to as a "pot boiler," involved dropping hot rocks into a water-safe container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This method allowed people to simmer food for thousands of years until the [[development_of_pottery_for_cooking | development of pottery for cooking]] provided water and fire-safe vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Archaeological records for early wet cooking methods are scarce because the materials used often rot quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, anthropologist John Speth proposed in 2015 that stew or soup might be much older than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. He observed that a flammable material like animal hide filled with wet ingredients won't burn when held directly over a fire because the water prevents it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This suggests ancient people might have used more waterproof, less drippy containers, such as an animal stomach or a woven basket lined with clay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

There is archaeological evidence that Neanderthals ate wet-cooked food; a barley grain recovered from a Neanderthal's teeth in modern-day Iraq, dating back 50,000 years, appears to have been boiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This predates the first archaeological indications of more advanced wet cooking methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Process of Stone Boiling
To recreate [[significance_of_stone_boiling | stone boiling]], a hole in the dirt can be lined with a large leaf, such as a banana leaf, to hold water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Smooth river cobbles were historically preferred for heating, as they are less likely to chip into the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. These hot stones are then carefully lifted into the water basin to boil the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

When stones are repeatedly heated and rapidly cooled, they develop a characteristic pattern of cracking and glazing known as "crazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Crazed river cobbles first appear in the archaeological record around 30,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. While their precise use as "pot boilers" isn't certain, it's known that pot boilers became a significant cooking method, persisting well into the era of written history and even used by some today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Stone boiling separates the water from the fire, preventing the fire from being extinguished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This method can effectively cook grains, and any sand or pebbles mixed in with the grain will sink to the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Wet cooking represented a significant advancement for humanity, allowing for greater nutrient extraction from food, as nothing drips into the fire and is wasted; all nutrients are preserved in the broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. It also enabled the softening of tough foods for easier chewing and digestion, allowing more people to be fed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Nixtamalization Theory
Scientists believe [[significance_of_stone_boiling | stone boiling]] may have led to the invention of nixtamalization in ancient Americas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This process involves soaking corn in an alkaline solution to remove its waxy hull, making it suitable for hominy, grits, and tortillas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Nixtamalization also makes certain amino acids in corn more bioavailable, preventing the nutritional deficiency disease pellagra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The idea for treating food with a caustic alkali might have originated accidentally when people boiled corn using limestone pot boilers, which can create a strong enough base to nixtamalize corn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## The Invention of the Cooking Pot
While stone boiling in leaves or animal skins had advantages, it also had obvious disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The shift to cooking directly in pots on the fire was a significant evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Clay, a common material in river basins, forms from the chemical weathering of exposed rock, with dissolved minerals flowing into river and lake deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Early people likely discovered clay when digging holes for other purposes, noticing its smooth, plastic, and moldable qualities when wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Adding water makes it more moldable, and working it, a process modern potters call "wedging," distributes water and removes air bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

A formed clay piece can be dried in the sun, becoming hard, but it will still dissolve in water, leading to a muddy broth and the eventual disintegration of the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. To make it durable and waterproof, the clay must be "fired" at extreme high heat in a kiln, changing its chemical structure into a ceramic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This firing process may have been discovered accidentally, perhaps by accelerating the drying of a piece with fire or by a dried piece staying in a fire long enough after the water boiled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

The first kilns would have been pits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. A dried, preheated pot would be placed in a fire pit, and coals would be fed to fully encase it, ensuring it gets hot enough to become ceramic without cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Once fired, these ceramic pots allowed for boiling food directly on the fire, eliminating the need to shuttle hot rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Scientists once thought pottery was invented 5,000 to 10,000 years ago, but in 2012, pottery fragments from a cave in China were found dating back 20,000 years, making them the oldest known true ceramic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. These fragments appeared to have been used in a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

Clay pots were the primary type of cooking vessel for a long time, extending through the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and into the early modern period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. While metal is superior due to its thermal conductivity and resistance to cracking from thermal stress, it was historically too expensive for the average family's cooking pot until relatively recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Thus, ceramic pots were a simple, effective, and ubiquitous solution for a universal need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

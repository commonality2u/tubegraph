Mozzarella is widely considered the best cheese for pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A 2014 study found that only mozzarella, or a mozzarella-based blend, provides the browning and stretching properties most people expect from pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The type of mozzarella used significantly impacts the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Historically, mozzarella originated in Italy and was often made from water buffalo milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This results in a soft, high-moisture, milky, high-fat product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Fresh mozzarella tastes sweet, fresh, and subtle, resembling solidified milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. A key characteristic for pizza making is its high water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Due to its softness, fresh mozzarella typically cannot be shredded; it "smooshes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It is usually cut or torn into pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Effects on Pizza
When used on a New York-style pizza (wide, thin, solid sheet of cheese), fresh mozzarella leads to a wet and unappetizingly soggy crust because of its high moisture content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

However, fresh mozzarella is ideal for Neapolitan-style pizza. This style uses significantly less cheese, applied in splotches rather than a full sheet, which prevents the pizza from becoming soggy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Neapolitan pizzas are also often baked in very hot ovens (e.g., 700°F convection) which helps achieve a desirable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## [[differences_between_fresh_mozzarella_and_lowmoisture_mozzarella | Low-Moisture Mozzarella]] (Pizza Cheese)

Developed in the United States after World War II, particularly in dairy regions like Wisconsin, low-moisture part-skim mozzarella (often called "pizza cheese") was created to overcome the commercial challenges of fresh mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Fresh mozzarella was too wet, soft, messy, and not shelf-stable for mass production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Manufacturing Process
The production of low-moisture mozzarella involves several steps to remove fat and moisture and enhance stability:
1.  **Standardizing Milk:** The milk fat content is lowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
2.  **Coagulation & Fermentation:** Rennet (an enzyme) is added to coagulate the milk. Specific bacterial cultures are introduced to ferment the lactose, which lowers the pH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
3.  **Cooking/Stretching:** The product is put into a "cooker stretcher" and warmed to around 60°C (140°F). This step helps extend shelf life by inactivating some bacteria and enzymes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Unlike fresh mozzarella, the moisture is removed chemically through enzymes and acid, not just by physical squeezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This acidification process, whether by bacterial fermentation (e.g., Grande cheese) or vinegar (e.g., Polly-O), gives low-moisture mozzarella a sharper taste than fresh mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Effects on Pizza
Low-moisture mozzarella is preferred for styles like New York pizza. It browns nicely, results in a crispy, dry crust, and the cheese itself is firmer with a slight "snap" when cooled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The acidic qualities are crucial for the flavor of New York style pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Full-Fat vs. Part-Skim
Low-moisture mozzarella is available in full-fat (whole milk low moisture, WM LM) and part-skim varieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Full-Fat:** Offers a richer flavor but can result in a grease layer on the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. It is harder to find in grocery stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Part-Skim:** Tends to be firmer, especially when young, and is easier to cut and shred for large-scale manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. It is ubiquitous in grocery stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## [[challenges_with_preshredded_mozzarella_cheese for_pizza | Pre-Shredded Mozzarella]]

Pre-shredded mozzarella is convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. However, it often contains anti-caking agents like corn starch, potato starch, and calcium sulfate to prevent clumping in the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Effects on Pizza
These anti-caking agents can interfere with the melting and browning of the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The materials themselves may not melt at pizza baking temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. If too much is present, it can prevent the cheese from melting properly, creating a "battered" or "breaded" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Additionally, these agents can soak up moisture released during baking, making the cheese surface too dry and leading to excessive toasting or burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This is often a quality control issue, with some producers adding too much anti-caking mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. If one brand doesn't work, trying another is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

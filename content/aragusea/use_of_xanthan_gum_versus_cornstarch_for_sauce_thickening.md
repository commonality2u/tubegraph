When aiming for a slightly thickened sauce, two common agents are cornstarch and xanthan gum. Both can achieve the desired effect, but they have different properties and methods of application.

## Cornstarch for Thickening
Cornstarch is a traditional thickener that can be used for sauces, such as an *au jus* where a slight thickening is desired.
To use cornstarch:
*   Mix approximately two teaspoons of cornstarch with a little water to create a slurry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   Pour the slurry into the sauce and bring it to a boil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

A common characteristic of sauces thickened with cornstarch is that they will develop a skin when they sit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Additionally, the thickness of a cornstarch-thickened sauce can vary depending on its temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Xanthan Gum for Thickening
Xanthan gum is a potent thickening agent that can be found in grocery stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. It is particularly useful when only a small amount of thickening is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

To use xanthan gum:
*   Unlike cornstarch, xanthan gum disperses in oil rather than water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   Place a small amount of olive oil in a dish and add about half a teaspoon of xanthan gum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. It will dissolve directly into the oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   If xanthan gum is added directly to water, it will clump up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   Add the oil-xanthan gum mixture to the sauce and let it cook for a few minutes before assessing the consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Properties and Considerations
*   **Potency**: Xanthan gum is very potent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Texture**: It can impart a "preternaturally smooth, silky mouthfeel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Overuse**: Using too much xanthan gum can give a sauce a "mucousy texture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Temperature Stability**: A key advantage of xanthan gum over cornstarch is that the sauce's thickness remains consistent regardless of whether it is very hot or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Like cornstarch, it will also develop a skin if it sits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

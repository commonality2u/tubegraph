This article details a specific method for preparing fluffy Chinese-style steamed rice, as tried and observed by the author <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Fluffy Chinese-Style Steamed Rice (Trial Method)

### Quantity
*   Approximately half a cup of rice (100 grams) is sufficient for two people, but more may be desired depending on needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Preparation
1.  **Wash and Drain:** Wash and drain the rice multiple times to remove the free starch coat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This is done to achieve fluffy Chinese-style steamed rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  **Add Water:** Add 1.75 times the rice volume in plain water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. No salt is added for this style of rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Cooking Process (Trial Method)
1.  **Initial Boil (Uncovered):** Heat the rice on high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This [[cooking_techniques|cooking technique]] involves not covering the pot at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Bring it to a boil and let it cook until the surface becomes pockmarked and the rice peaks above the water level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  **Steaming (Covered):** Once the surface is pockmarked, cover the pot and reduce the heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Allow it to steam for approximately 15 minutes, or until the rest of the dinner is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Observation on Method
The author expresses doubt about the effectiveness of bringing rice to a boil uncovered, noting that the resulting rice was "pretty dry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. It is suggested that more water might be needed at the start when using this [[cooking_techniques|cooking technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

This [[roasted_tomato_sauce_recipe | tomato sauce recipe]] is particularly suitable for [[using_garden_tomatoes_for_sauce | garden tomatoes]] in the summer, offering an intense, sweet, and smoky roasted flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While [[use_of_fresh_tomatoes_versus_precooked_sauce | canned tomatoes]] might be preferable for [[making_homemade_tomato_sauce | making tomato sauce]] most of the year, this method is "worthy" of fresh, ripe garden tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Preparation and Initial Roast

The process begins by setting the oven to 450°F (232°C), with convection if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Tomato Preparation
This recipe is an excellent way to use parts of tomatoes that are still perfectly good, even if they have imperfections from birds or bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Simply cut away any undesirable parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Ensure all tomatoes are cut at least in half, and larger ones into more pieces, to achieve roughly equal size chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Pan Setup
Coat the pan with olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Arrange the tomato pieces skin side up, which is important for the roasting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Each tomato chunk requires its "own personal space" on the pan to roast thoroughly, meaning they cannot be piled up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This technique is not suitable for [[making_homemade_tomato_sauce | making a big quantity]] of sauce due to the need for individual space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Roasting Process
Place the pan with the skin-side-up tomatoes into the blazing hot oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

After about 30 minutes, the tomato skins will likely appear burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. However, this is intentional; the burned skins protect the tomato flesh underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The sauce is not yet done if there's still a significant layer of juice at the bottom of the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Continue cooking until this liquid reduces and starts to brown on the pan's bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For the speaker, this took an additional 15 minutes, but cooking times can vary based on the tomatoes and oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Finishing the Sauce

### Adding Aromatics
Once the tomatoes are nearly done, add chopped garlic (a few cloves) and shallots (a couple, or one large) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Roast these for only four to five minutes; avoid letting the bottom of the pan darken further, as it will be on the verge of burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Removing Skins and Mashing
Remove the burnt skins from the tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Most skins can be lifted off easily, or the tomato flesh can be shaken out of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. If some bits of burnt skin cannot be removed, leave them, as they will contribute a smoky note to the sauce, similar to fire-roasted peppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

With a wooden spoon, mash the tomatoes directly in the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. As liquid is released, use it to deglaze the pan, scraping up the deeply caramelized tomato juice stuck to the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This step combines the caramelized flavor with the fresher taste of the tomato flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The residual heat will continue to cook the garlic and shallots if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Seasoning and Optional Additions
Season the sauce with salt and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The sauce can be left chunky or pureed for a smoother consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

> [!INFO] Optional Ingredients
> A significant amount of butter can be melted into the sauce using the pan's residual heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Maintaining a low temperature prevents the butter from separating, resulting in a thick, glossy emulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This butter addition gives the sauce a flavor resembling an Italian version of Indian butter chicken gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For [[making_tomato_sauce_for_pasta | pasta]], a little fresh basil can be torn in at the last second to keep it green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Pasta cooking water can also be added to adjust the sauce's thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Grated cheese is another common addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Flavor Profile and Variations

This [[making_homemade_tomato_sauce | simple recipe]] allows the tomatoes to "shine through virtually unadulterated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. It showcases the tomatoes' full range, from bright sweetness to deep umami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

While [[optional_ingredients_for_tomato_sauce | optional ingredients]] can be added to make it more complex, some experiments have yielded mixed results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>:
*   **Roasted carrots** mashed with the tomatoes were considered "okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   Adding a little **white wine** at the deglazing stage was attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Roasting **whole shallots** with the tomatoes resulted in a sauce that was "too sweet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

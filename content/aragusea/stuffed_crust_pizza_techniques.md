Stuffed crust pizza involves tucking a ring of cheese into the dough around the edge of the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the concept is simple, there are specific techniques to ensure a successful outcome and prevent issues like leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Dough Preparation
For stuffed crust, certain [[pizza_dough_preparation | dough preparation]] adjustments are beneficial:
*   **Recipe**: Use a standard pizza dough recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: Knead in a little extra flour to make the dough drier and less sticky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. A drier dough is stronger and less prone to tearing and leaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Quantity**: Allocate more dough per pizza than usual; for example, use enough dough for three pizzas instead of four to accommodate wrapping the cheese ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Rising**: Avoid putting olive oil in the bowl where the dough rises, as oil on the dough ball surface can hinder a good seal around the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Cold Rise**: A two-day cold rise in the fridge is recommended for better flavor and easier handling, though a two-hour counter rise is also an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Cold dough is less likely to tear during handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Cheese Selection and Preparation
*   **Type of Cheese**: String cheese is ideal for the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Its proteins align in long, parallel threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Professionals often use unbroken coils of string cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Thickness**: For home ovens, it's advisable to cut string cheese pieces in half lengthwise, as whole pieces might be too thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Chilling**: Chill the prepared string cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Topping Cheese**: Whole milk, low-moisture string cheese can also be used for the pizza topping, cut into chilled "pellets" to slow melting in ovens that don't get hot enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Equipment
*   **Pizza Screen**: A pizza screen is highly recommended for baking stuffed crust pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. It prevents the dough from sticking during the long preparation time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> and gives the bottom a golden finish reminiscent of airport pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. A 14-inch diameter screen is a good maximum size for a home oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Baking Surface**: Bake either on a screen or on parchment paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Baking Steel/Stone**: Use a baking steel or stone to ensure the bottom of the pizza browns properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Assembly Process
1.  **Rolling the Dough**: Roll the cold dough directly on the counter without flour dusting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The dough sticking to the counter prevents it from snapping back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Aim for an evenly round shape, slightly wider than your pizza screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Push down hard from the middle and push out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Hand stretching typically won't get the outer ring thin enough for stuffed crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
2.  **Positioning**: Carefully peel the dough off the counter and position it evenly on the pizza screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
3.  **Creating Excess Dough**: Roll out the dough "skirts" hanging over the edge of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This ensures a lot of very thin excess dough around the edge to fold over and seal the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. If there's a short bit, excess dough can be torn from elsewhere and grafted on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
4.  **Adding Cheese**: Place the string cheese ring around the edge of the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
5.  **Sealing the Crust**:
    *   Wet the dough edges with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Fold and crimp the excess dough over the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. It's crucial to have a significant amount of excess dough folded back onto the interior of the pizza to prevent the cheese ring from leaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This also means the dough isn't stretched too tightly over the cheese, reducing the risk of tearing and leaking through the outer side or bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
6.  **Seasoning the Crust**: Prepare a mixture of melted butter, herbs, spices, and salt until it has a sandy consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Brush this mixture over the top and sides of the untopped crust to enhance its flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
7.  **Final Seal**: Once the crust is greased (so fingertips won't stick), press hard to fully seal the cheese ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Baking
*   **Preheating**: Preheat your oven to full blast with a baking steel or stone for at least an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Oven Settings**: Depending on your oven, you might need to switch to the broiler (top element) halfway through baking to ensure proper browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Cheese Melting**: Homemade stuffed crust cheese tends to flatten and give off steam, creating a hollow dome above it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This cavity can contribute to a croissant-like texture when bitten into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Stuffed Crust Pizza in Fiction
> The inspiration for creating this stuffed crust pizza tutorial stems from Lauren's Young Adult novel, "Hot and Crusty Pizza." In the book, the main character was born on the bathroom floor of a pizza parlor called "Hot and Crusty Pizza" and was gifted free pizza for life and a guaranteed job at 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. A running joke in the book is that stuffed crust pizzas are consistently found in the restaurant at the end of every shift, despite "Hot and Crusty" not making them, leading characters to try and figure out who is bringing in pizza from another establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

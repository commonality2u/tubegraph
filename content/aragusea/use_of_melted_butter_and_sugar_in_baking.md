This cookie recipe utilizes specific techniques and ingredient quantities to achieve a particular texture and appearance, notably incorporating melted butter and extra sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Ingredients and Their Effects

### Butter
The recipe calls for two sticks of [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | salted butter]], melted completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Using melted butter contributes to a denser, chewier texture in the final cookie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, melted butter can cause cookies to spread too thinly during baking if the dough isn't properly chilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Sugar
Instead of the usual one and a half cups, this recipe uses two full cups of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The additional sugar is primarily for texture rather than sweetness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This extra sugar contributes to a chewier cookie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, aligning with the general [[impact_of_sugar_and_fat_on_bread_shelf_life_and_texture | impact of sugar on texture]].

### Molasses (as a brown sugar substitute)
A "glug" of molasses is added to the dough, eliminating the need to keep brown sugar on hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. When mixed, the molasses and white sugar combine to form brown sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Other Ingredients
*   **Vanilla:** A "glug" of vanilla extract is added without precise measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Eggs:** Two whole eggs are incorporated and mixed until smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Salt:** Two teaspoons of salt are used, as extra salt is considered delicious in cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Baking Soda:** One teaspoon of baking soda is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **[[benefits_of_bread_flour_in_cookies | Bread Flour]]:** While high-protein bread flour was initially thought to provide a chewier texture, it primarily gives a smoother texture that is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The dough starts with two cups of flour, with more added until the desired consistency is reached, typically around two and a half cups total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The dough should appear wet but not be very sticky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Less flour can be used for thinner cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Dough Preparation and Baking Method

### Chilling the Dough
The dough is refrigerated for at least 30 minutes, which makes it easier to handle and prevents excessive spreading during baking, especially crucial when using melted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Unconventional [[broiling_method_for_cookies | Broiling and Baking]]
Traditionally, cookies can be baked at 375°F (190°C) for about 12 minutes, resulting in a slightly underdone center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. However, to avoid a pale or grayish appearance, an unconventional method is employed:
1.  **Shaping:** Dough is formed into golf balls, then flattened into hockey pucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Parchment paper is used on the baking sheet to prevent sticking and simplify cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
2.  **Broiling:** The flattened dough is placed under the broiler for about one minute until the tops are golden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. It's critical to remove them before they burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Multiple pans can be broiled in succession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
3.  **Baking:** The oven is then switched to baking mode, allowing the broiler to cool for a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The cookies are then baked for 10 to 12 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. As they bake and spread, cracks appear on the surface, which are considered visually appealing and can indicate doneness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

This [[broiling_method_for_cookies | broiling method]] results in a more appealing aesthetic while retaining the desired slightly underdone, gooey-when-hot and chewy-when-cooled center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

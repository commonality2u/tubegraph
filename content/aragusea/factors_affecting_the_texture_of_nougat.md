From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Nougat is an aerated confection, a primary component in nearly every candy bar alongside caramel, chocolate, and nuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its structure involves air stabilized by some type of protein, with a sugar matrix forming the continuous phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The continuous phase refers to the main structure of the substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In nougat, air is the dispersed phase, held within a sugar matrix and a web of proteins surrounding the air bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This protein web is what makes the whipped sugar syrup stable, solid, and contributes to its stretchy or bouncy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

An aerated sugar syrup stabilized with protein describes many confections, including [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | meringue]], [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | marshmallow]], and divinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The factors differentiating nougat from these other confections, and leading to its varied textures, come down to four main variables, according to Dr. Richard Hartel, Professor of Food Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>:
1.  The kind of protein used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
2.  The water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
3.  The kind of sugar being used and its state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
4.  The air content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

## Protein Type and Its Impact on Texture

Nougat is typically made with egg protein (albumin) and sometimes soy protein (globulin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | Marshmallow]] often contains these but also commonly includes gelatin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The type of protein significantly influences the elasticity of the confection:
*   **Gelatin** forms a squishy, elastic texture around air bubbles, causing marshmallows to bounce back when pressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This elasticity comes from the complex helices formed by its secondary and tertiary structure at junction zones, which act like springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Albumin (from eggs) and Globulin (from soy)** form simpler networks that do not exhibit the same elastic "spring" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. When pressed, nougat, which typically uses egg protein, generally stays where it's left because its structure is broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Water Content and Firmness

The amount of water in a confection directly impacts its softness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   In candy making, water content is controlled by boiling the syrup to a specific temperature; higher temperatures mean more water has been boiled off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   Italian [[differences_between_nougat_marshmallow_and_meringue | meringue]], which uses hot syrup drizzled into egg foam without gelatin, has a softer, spreadable texture because its syrup is cooked to a lower temperature (around 240°F / 115°C), leaving more water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Nougat made by Crown Candy, for example, is cooked to a much higher temperature (270°F / 132°C), resulting in a much firmer product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   Divinity, a classic southern treat, uses syrup cooked to about 250°F (120°C), making it a softer product than typical nougat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   Meringue cookies, baked in an oven until almost all water is removed from the outer crust, become crunchy instead of fluffy or chewy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Humidity also plays a role in water content, as sugar is hygroscopic (sucks water from the air) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Candy makers adjust boiling temperatures based on humidity to account for water absorption, ensuring consistent texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Sugar Type and State: Crystalline vs. Chewy

The type and state of sugar dictate whether nougat is brittle or chewy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>:
*   **Crystallization:**
    *   Nougat that is partially crystalline, like in a Three Musketeers bar, breaks clean when pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The sugar crystals break up the stretchiness of the syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   A chewy nougat, such as in a Charleston Chew, will stretch longer when pulled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The fewer crystals present, the chewier the texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

*   **Sugar Ratios:**
    *   Candy makers control crystallization by altering the ratio of sugars, typically cane sugar (sucrose) and corn syrup (glucose and other sugars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Honey can also be used instead of corn syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   Corn syrup acts as a "doctoring agent," inhibiting the formation of sugar crystals by getting between sucrose molecules and preventing them from linking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
    *   A Three Musketeers bar has more sugar than corn syrup, leading to its brittle texture, while a Charleston Chew has more corn syrup than sugar, resulting in its chewy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

*   **Inversion and Seed Crystals:**
    *   Sugar crystallization can be stopped by inverting sugar (breaking sucrose into monosaccharides) using heat or acid, which is why some recipes call for cream of tartar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
    *   The size of crystals also matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Adding powdered sugar to nougat as "seed crystals" can lead to many very small crystals, achieving a "short" (brittle) texture, especially after curing for a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Air Content and Density

The amount of air whipped into the confection significantly alters its density and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   Marshmallow, with a low density (around 0.3-0.4), is less dense than nougat (around 0.9-1.0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   Nougat is much denser than marshmallow, and its texture can be changed by adjusting the aeration level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   Air is a "free" ingredient, and incorporating more air into a product can make it appear larger, which is a common practice in the food industry to increase perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Ultimately, like [[impact_of_sugar_and_fat_on_bread_shelf_life_and_texture | bread making]], confectionary involves subtle differences in ingredient type, proportions, and processing to create a vast range of textures and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

A quick tomato sauce can be prepared efficiently, cooking in less than 30 minutes when simmered in a pan for increased evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Ingredients

*   Garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>
*   Shallots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>
    *   Shallots are preferred over onions as they are single-serving and easier to chop finely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
*   Olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>
*   Tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>
*   Good quality canned crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>
*   White wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>
*   Salt and Pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>
*   Fresh basil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>

## Preparation Steps

1.  Chop the garlic and shallot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
2.  Pour olive oil into a pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
3.  Fry off the shallots and garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
4.  Add tomato paste, frying it to mellow its flavor and enhance intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
5.  Pour in a can of good quality crushed tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
6.  Add a glug of white wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
7.  Reduce the heat to a simmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
8.  Simmer in a pan (rather than a pot) to allow for more surface area and faster evaporation, reducing cooking time to a half-hour at most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
9.  Stir frequently to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
10. Once desired thickness is achieved (which should be less than half an hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, add salt and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
11. Incorporate fresh basil just before serving to keep it green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

This quick sauce is made as part of a [[making_tomato_sauce_for_pasta | Chicken Parm recipe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. While the transcript does not detail [[making_homemade_tomato_sauce | making homemade tomato sauce]] from scratch, this quick method is effective when a rapid [[roasted_tomato_sauce_recipe | roasted tomato sauce recipe]] isn't needed, and for its speed, it does not involve [[using_garden_tomatoes_for_sauce | using garden tomatoes for sauce]] or [[steps_to_concasse_a_tomato_for_soup | concassing a tomato]]. It also avoids a [[roasting_technique_for_tomato_sauce | roasting technique for tomato sauce]] and doesn't rely on [[use_of_fresh_tomatoes_versus_precooked_sauce | fresh tomatoes versus pre-cooked sauce]] since it uses canned crushed tomatoes. The sauce is versatile and could potentially be adapted for [[creating_homemade_pizza_sauce | creating homemade pizza sauce]].

When preparing a classic mac and cheese, the choice and preparation of pasta are crucial for achieving the desired texture in the final baked dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Recommended Pasta Types

For a specific mac and cheese recipe that uses processed American cheese and no roux, large pasta shells are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, the recipe explicitly states that "honestly whatever shape you want" can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. A pound of pasta is typically used for the recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Preparing the Pasta

The method of cooking the pasta is specific to ensure it holds up well during baking:

*   **Boiling Water:** Start by putting enough water on to boil for a pound of pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Always salt the boiling water before adding the pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Cooking Time and Texture:** Hard boil the pasta for exactly five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. It's crucial not to boil it for any longer, as it will become mushy after it bakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

*   **Draining:** Once cooked, the pasta should be drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Assembly:** After draining, the pasta goes directly into the baking dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

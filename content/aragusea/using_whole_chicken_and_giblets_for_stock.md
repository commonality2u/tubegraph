Using a whole chicken and its giblets is a fundamental life skill for creating a large quantity of nutritious and flavorful food, often as a base for dishes like [[how_to_make_basic_chicken_soup | chicken soup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This method efficiently converts a single small animal into versatile stock that can feed you all week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Preparing the Chicken and Giblets for Stock

To begin, use a standard-sized chicken, such as a four-pound (two-kilogram) chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

1.  **Place Chicken in Pot**: Rinse the chicken bag and drop the entire chicken into your largest pot to contain any mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. All the juices from the packaging are edible and beneficial for the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
2.  **Add Giblets**: Look inside the chicken's cavity for a small bag containing giblets (the gizzard, neck, liver, and heart) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. These are excellent for enriching the stock, so drop them directly into the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
3.  **Incorporate Scraps**: If you have old vegetables like a shriveled onion, they can be added to the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. It's generally advised not to use fresh, good quality vegetables solely for stock, as their primary role here is to impart flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. When adding large pieces like an onion, consider keeping them whole for easy removal later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Adding Water and Initial Simmer

1.  **Fill with Water**: Slowly fill the pot with water to avoid splashing raw chicken juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. While filtered water is often preferred for taste, tap water can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    *   **Water Temperature**: Culinary experts often suggest starting stock with cool water, which results in a slightly less cloudy stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Public health recommendations also favor cool tap water due to the potential for dissolved lead or other contaminants in hot tap water from older pipe systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
2.  **Initial Cook**: Place the pot on high heat with the lid on to retain energy and speed up heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Once the water is vigorously bubbling, reduce the heat to a spirited simmer, cover, and cook for one to two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Post-Simmer Processing

After simmering, the chicken should be very soft, with meat easily falling off the bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

1.  **Remove Chicken**: Carefully drain any hot broth from the chicken's cavity to prevent scalding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Remove the chicken and any large solids like the old onion, which can be composted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
2.  **Straining and Skimming (Optional)**:
    *   You can strain the broth if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   Skimming off impurities is primarily for cosmetic reasons, as all components in the pot (except bones) are edible, similar to a whole [[roasting_chicken_techniques | roast chicken]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   To clarify the stock, stir in one or two eggs and simmer for a minute; the egg proteins will coagulate and trap particulates, which can then be skimmed off or strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   The rendered chicken fat is delicious and should be left in the stock as it will be minimal in the final soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Reusing Chicken Scraps

To be even more frugal, after picking the meat off the bones, you can use the leftover bones, skin, and other scraps to make a secondary stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   Brown them slightly in the oven to compensate for some flavor lost during the first simmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   Place the browned scraps in a pot, simmer for a few hours, and strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   While it may not have the same fresh taste as the initial stock, it will still offer significant flavor and body, perfect for a stew with whole grains, vegetables, butter, and herbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

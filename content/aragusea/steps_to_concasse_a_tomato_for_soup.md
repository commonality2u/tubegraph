From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

The traditional method to concasse a tomato involves a multi-step process to remove the skin and seeds, often used for dishes where a smooth texture is desired without the addition of these elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>.

## Concasse Steps

1.  **Boil the Tomato**
    Take a tomato and boil it for approximately 10 seconds. This helps to release the skin from the flesh underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>.
2.  **Ice Bath**
    Immediately after boiling, fish the tomato out and plunge it into ice water. This stops the cooking process and causes the skin to contract and split, making it easier to peel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.
3.  **Peel**
    Once cooled, the skin should be easy to peel off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:64">[01:34:64]</a>.
4.  **Remove Seeds and Gel**
    Cut the tomato open and carefully cut out the "bitter seeds" and the "nasty acidic gel" that surrounds them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. This step is intended to eliminate unwanted bitterness and acidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:75">[01:46:75]</a>.
5.  **Dice the Flesh**
    Take the remaining solid outer flesh and dice it into perfect little squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:33">[01:50:33]</a>.

## Alternative Approach for [[making_a_great_vegetable_soup | Vegetable Soup]]

For a [[making_a_great_vegetable_soup | vegetable soup]], this elaborate concasse process is largely considered unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:09">[02:03:09]</a>.

Instead of concassing:
*   Simply [[vegetable_preparation_for_soup | chop]] any "halfway decent [[tomato | tomato]]" into random chunks and boil it in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>.
*   In a soup with only one [[tomato | tomato]], the amount of skin will be minimal and likely unnoticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:02">[02:13:02]</a>.
*   [[tomato | Tomato]] skins are rich in lycopene, an antioxidant, and pectin, which can help thicken the soup as it cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:40">[02:19:40]</a>.
*   The acidity from the seeds and gel is often desired in food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:64">[02:29:64]</a>. While seeds might be bitter in high concentration, they are not typically so in a [[making_a_great_vegetable_soup | vegetable soup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:12">[02:36:12]</a>.

It is suggested to add chopped [[tomato | tomatoes]] after harder ingredients like onions and carrots have started cooking. This allows the [[tomato | tomatoes]] enough time to break down while retaining some freshness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Stuffed Shells: An Italian-American Classic

Stuffed shells are a classic Italian-American entrée, often featuring a configuration of pasta, red sauce, and ricotta cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This dish can evoke childhood memories of simple, yet hearty, Italian-American meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Sauce Preparation Tips

A robust tomato sauce is fundamental for stuffed shells and other pasta dishes.

### Quantity and Storage
*   It's always beneficial to make extra sauce and freeze it for future use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Ingredients and Sautéing
*   **Aromatics:** Begin with two large onions, chopped, and at least half a head of garlic, peeled and chopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   Sauté onions frequently in a large pot over medium-high heat with plenty of olive oil until they soften and begin to brown, which takes about 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Garlic Timing:** Add garlic after the onions have started browning; adding it from the start may cause it to burn if not stirred constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Tomato Paste:** Include a 6-ounce (170 gram) can of tomato paste and let it fry for a moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Deglazing:** Have crushed tomatoes ready to add quickly when the tomato paste is on the verge of burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze it once the tomatoes are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Liquid & Flavor:** Optionally, add a glass of red or white wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Season with plenty of pepper and dried herbs like oregano, thyme, and dried basil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Start with a big pinch of salt and consider adding more olive oil for richness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Simmering
*   Simmer the sauce over medium-low heat, stirring frequently between other tasks to prevent burning at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Flavor Adjustment:** Taste the sauce before finishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. If it tastes bitter, try stirring in more salt, as salt can offset bitter notes in canned tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. A pinch of sugar can also be added, if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** Loosen thick sauces with water if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. For a smoother sauce, use a stick blender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Cheese Filling Preparation

The cheese filling is crucial for the texture and flavor of stuffed shells.

### Cheese Choices
*   **Ricotta:** Use about 1.5 pounds (680 grams) of ricotta cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Full-fat ricotta generally tastes better, but part-skim works fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Ricotta, made from the recooked whey of other cheese making, serves as the primary bulk of the dish due to its relatively lean and high-protein content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Mozzarella:** Add a pound (450 grams) of mozzarella, grated finely, to make the filling smoother and meltier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. While some reserve mozzarella for topping, mixing it into the filling is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Pecorino Romano:** Incorporate 7 ounces (200 grams) of pecorino romano for stronger flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Pecorino is a hard grating cheese popular in Southern Italy, made from sheep's milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Save some for dusting at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Additional Ingredients
*   **Garlic:** Grate a couple of cloves of garlic very finely for the cheese filling, as it won't be cooked extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Eggs:** Add eggs (e.g., four) to make the filling set into a more cake-like texture; without eggs, it can be more crumbly and prone to falling off the fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Seasoning:** Use a generous amount of black pepper, but no additional salt, as the pecorino romano provides sufficient saltiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Fresh Herbs:** Chop fresh parsley and basil, removing thick stems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Reserve some for garnishing if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Optional Additions:** Blanched or thoroughly drained frozen spinach can also be added to the filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Mixing
*   Thoroughly smash and mix all ingredients by hand until a homogeneous, almost dough-like mixture is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This amount of filling is typically suitable for a one-pound bag of shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Cooking Pasta Shells

For stuffed shells, careful cooking of the pasta is essential.

*   **Size:** Use jumbo shells, as smaller ones are difficult to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Cooking Time:** Boil the shells until pliable for filling, but still slightly crunchy, as they will cook further in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. A good rule of thumb is to boil them for about 3 minutes less than the package directions suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Preventing Stickiness:** After draining, rinse the shells with cold water to stop cooking, rinse off starch (which causes sticking), and cool them down for easier handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Stirring:** If using a smaller pot, stir the shells frequently to prevent them from sticking to the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Assembly and Baking

### Assembling the Dish
*   Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   Spread a good layer of tomato sauce in a baking dish, ensuring there's enough liquid to come up to the "shoulders" of the shells once placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   Fill the parboiled shells with the cheese mixture. Using fingers to smash the filling in is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Squishing the shells slightly can help expand the opening for easier filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   Position the filled shells cheese-side up in the sauce so the cheese can brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Presentation Preference:** To maintain individual shell visibility, avoid topping with more sauce and mozzarella, which can make it resemble lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Baking Process
*   Cover the baking dish with foil and steam cook for 15-20 minutes until bubbly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This helps prevent the dish from drying out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   After the initial baking, remove the foil and turn on the broiler to get some color on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Doneness:** The filling should be bubbling but still appear somewhat wet; be careful not to overcook, as it can become gritty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Freezing and Reheating Baked Pasta

*   Stuffed shells can be prepared in advance and frozen uncooked. Cover the pans and freeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   To cook from frozen, place the covered pan into a cold oven, then turn the heat to 400°F (200°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. It will be thawed and cooked in about 45 minutes to an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   Baked pasta dishes often improve when reheated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Garlic Bread (Side Dish)

*   **Butter Quantity:** Use a generous amount of softened butter, e.g., two sticks (half a pound / 225 grams) for a large baguette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Flavoring:** Mix half a head of chopped garlic, plenty of pepper, and enough salt to make the butter mixture taste slightly too salty (it will season the bread) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Herbs can be mixed in or sprinkled on top at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Application:** Slather the butter mixture generously onto the bread, ensuring enough melts down into the bread as it cooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Broiling:** Place on a tray (as butter will leak) and broil for a few minutes until brown and crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Serving Preferences

*   While traditional Italian-American dishes might be "sloppy" with excess sauce, a "tighter" dish with a reduced, drier sauce is preferred by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This results in a drier, firmer texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   Serve with extra sauce on the plate, especially if bread is served, for mopping up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

This pizza recipe utilizes a standard [[pizza_dough_preparation | pizza dough]] recipe, with specific steps for its preparation and a cold rise method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Dough Ingredients and Initial Preparation

The basic [[pizza_dough_ingredients_and_preparation | pizza dough]] involves:
*   Yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Warm sugar water (for blooming the yeast) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   Additional water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Bread flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

### Mixing and Dividing
1.  Bloom yeast in warm sugar water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
2.  Add more water, sugar, salt, olive oil, and bread flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
3.  Mix until the [[preparing_and_handling_pizza_dough | dough]] is smooth and elastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
4.  Divide the [[preparing_and_handling_pizza_dough | dough]] into individual balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Cold Rise Method

After dividing, the [[preparing_and_handling_pizza_dough | dough]] balls are prepared for a long, slow cold rise:
1.  Deposit each [[preparing_and_handling_pizza_dough | dough]] ball into its own oiled container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
2.  Cover the containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
3.  Immediately place them into the refrigerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
4.  A long, slow cold rise is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The video demonstrates working with [[aging_pizza_dough | dough]] that has [[aging_pizza_dough | aged]] for almost three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Handling Aged Dough

When ready to use the [[aging_pizza_dough | aged]] [[preparing_and_handling_pizza_dough | dough]]:
*   Stretch out the [[preparing_and_handling_pizza_dough | dough]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Use cornmeal on the pizza peel to prevent the [[preparing_and_handling_pizza_dough | dough]] from sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

The "water trick" is a popular [[nontraditional cooking methods | internet cooking method]] for mushrooms, involving cooking them in water instead of oil or other fats initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This method has gained viral popularity, partly because it seems to contradict traditional [[culinary_myths_about_cooking_mushrooms | classical culinary dogma]], particularly French culinary beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Challenging Culinary Dogma

Classical French culinary dogma asserts that getting mushrooms wet is detrimental, as it can waterlog them and dilute their flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Therefore, the traditional way to clean mushrooms is by brushing off dirt rather than washing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. However, this is largely considered "silly" because mushrooms release water when cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Cooking mushrooms in water can feel like a satisfying repudiation of these questionable past practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## How the Wet Method Works

The wet method involves using a thin film of water in a hot pan as a thermal interface, similar to how oil is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   Mushrooms are placed in the pan with water, preventing them from sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   The water effectively spreads heat around the mushrooms, causing them to cook down quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   However, water can only reach 100 degrees Celsius (212Â°F) before evaporating, which is not hot enough to brown the mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   The process requires cooking the mushrooms until their spongy internal structure (hyphae network) collapses and most of their water has evaporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Once the water has evaporated, a small amount of oil can be added to brown the surface of the mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Advantages

*   **Less sticking:** Water acts as an effective thermal interface, preventing mushrooms from sticking to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Less messy:** This method avoids the "spitting stage" that occurs when water from mushrooms hits hot oil in the [[conventional_method_of_cooking_mushrooms_with_oil | conventional method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Criticisms and Textural Impact

While effective, the wet method has some drawbacks, particularly regarding [[textural_analysis_and_characteristics_of_cooked_mushrooms | mushroom texture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>:
*   **Overcooking and Leathery Texture:** The speaker notes that the wet method often leads to overcooked mushrooms with a leathery texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This is because the mushrooms must be cooked extensively to evaporate all their internal water before browning can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Structural Collapse:** Mushrooms are composed of a fibrous network (hyphae) enclosing water and air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. When cooked, this network starts to break down, and water spills out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Unlike plant cell walls (pectin), mushroom cell walls are reinforced with chitin, which is more stable at high temperatures and doesn't break down into mush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. However, prolonged cooking in the wet method fully collapses this hyphae structure, resulting in an unpleasantly dense texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Evidence of Structural Collapse
A raw mushroom slice floats in water due to its air-filled cavities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   A mushroom slice cooked conventionally (with some air pockets remaining) will sink slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Conversely, a mushroom slice cooked using the water method and then browned in oil sinks immediately, indicating a full collapse of its internal cavities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Comparison to Conventional Cooking

The speaker generally prefers the [[conventional_method_of_cooking_mushrooms_with_oil | conventional method]] of cooking mushrooms with oil because it allows for browning early in the process, before significant water release, and permits cooking only until they've shrunk by about half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This approach maintains some internal cavities and results in a more pleasant texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

Regarding oil absorption, conventionally sauteed mushrooms absorb oil, but also release some back out as they cook and shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Both the wet method and the [[conventional_method_of_cooking_mushrooms_with_oil | conventional method]] work effectively, yielding similar results, though the textural outcome may differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

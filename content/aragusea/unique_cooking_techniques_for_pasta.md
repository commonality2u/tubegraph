Spaghetti all'Assassina, named after the feminine form of "assassin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, is a pasta dish originating from Bari in southeast Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While appearing to be simple spaghetti in tomato sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, its [[cooking_techniques | cooking techniques]] are markedly different from most pasta dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Assassina Method
Unlike traditional pasta preparation, Spaghetti all'Assassina is "more fried than it is boiled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This [[nontraditional_cooking_methods | nontraditional cooking method]] results in a distinct taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The sauce is typically spicy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, and the pasta cooks entirely within the sauce, absorbing its flavors throughout the noodle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Ingredients and Preparation
For two portions, the following ingredients and steps are suggested for the sauce:
*   **Chilies:** Jalapenos, sliced thick, are used for the sauce instead of dried red chili flakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. To reduce heat, the white pith can be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Garlic:** A large quantity of garlic is peeled and chopped, though not finely, as it will break down during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Tomatoes:** Whole fresh grape or cherry tomatoes (around 10 ounces / 283 grams for two portions) are pureed smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While straining is possible, retaining the skins and seeds adds fiber and is often unnoticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Tomato Broth:** The pureed tomatoes are diluted with at least an equivalent volume of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> and seasoned with a large pinch of salt to taste like a good soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Pre-cooked tomato sauce or canned tomato puree can also be used, diluted with water (e.g., two parts water to one part sauce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Tomato Paste:** A squeeze of tomato paste is added to provide concentrated tomato flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Pasta:** Approximately half a pound (225 grams) of spaghetti for two portions is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Cheaper pasta with a smooth, shiny surface is preferred over bronze-cut pasta, as the latter sheds too much starch, leading to a pasty sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Pan Choice:** A non-stick (Teflon) pan is recommended for ease of cooking and better results, as stainless steel or even cast iron pans tend to stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Optional Garnish: Charred Pickled Chilies
For an extra layer of flavor, small, mild chilies (like serrano) can be blistered directly in a flame until almost blackened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These are then placed in a quick pickle solution made of sugar, salt, and vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This [[nontraditional_cooking_methods | nontraditional cooking method]] provides a contrast to the dish's smoky and sweet-sour flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Cooking Process
The [[cooking_techniques | cooking techniques]] for Spaghetti all'Assassina are akin to making risotto:
1.  **Saut√© Aromatics:** A generous film of olive oil is heated in the pan, and the garlic and peppers are added for a head start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
2.  **Initial Broth & Pasta:** A thin layer of tomato broth is poured into the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The dry spaghetti is broken to fit a 10-inch pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, laid into the broth, and nudged to nestle all strands into the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
3.  **Frying Cycles:** The pasta is cooked until enough water evaporates for the bottom layer of spaghetti to start browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Once golden, another dose of tomato broth is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This process is repeated several times, working the liquid in and turning the pasta so different layers can brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The goal is a deep brown, not burnt, bottom layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
4.  **Final Adjustments:** Once the pasta is al dente, any remaining water is evaporated to allow the noodles to fry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. If more liquid is needed for cooking or a saucier texture, water or white wine can be splashed in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Fresh basil leaves are torn in at the end for contrast with the spicy sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Flavor and Texture
The dish offers a unique sensory experience:
*   **Sauce:** The sauce cooks down intensely, becoming "almost a jam" that is "very sweet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, especially with sweet grape tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Due to the starch released by the pasta, the sauce develops a velvety mouthfeel similar to risotto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Pasta:** The pasta's texture is significantly different from boiled pasta. It has a "toothiness" and is "crusty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, with the flavor of the sauce infused throughout the noodle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. It's described as "sweet and soft but with this dark spicy undercurrent of danger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

This unique approach to [[cooking_tips_for_pasta_dishes | cooking pasta]] offers a distinct departure from [[traditional_versus_modern_methods_for_pasta_dishes | traditional versus modern methods for pasta dishes]], demonstrating a different [[Cooking Techniques and Philosophy | Cooking Techniques and Philosophy]] that emphasizes frying and flavor absorption.

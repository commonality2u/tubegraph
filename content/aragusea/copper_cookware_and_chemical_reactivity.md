[[benefits_and_characteristics_of_copper_cookware | Copper cookware]] is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its unique physical and chemical properties in the kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While widely recognized as an incredible heat conductor, copper's chemical reactivity is also a significant factor in its culinary applications and safety considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Beneficial Chemical Reactions

### Egg Whites and Foam Stability
In [[historical_and_traditional_uses_of_copper_in_cooking | classical European cooking]], a raw, unlined copper bowl is the traditional choice for beating egg whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Copper is highly chemically reactive, which is desirable in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

When egg whites are beaten, proteins are bashed open and entangled to form a web that traps water and air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Over-beating can cause the proteins to tighten, expelling water and air, leading to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. When using copper bowls or utensils, copper ions are released and form complexes with the egg protein ovotransferrin (also known as conalbumin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. These copper-protein complexes are less reactive to temperature, making the foam more stable during beating and cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Another theory suggests that copper ions might bond with sulfur groups on egg proteins, preventing them from forming strong disulfide bonds with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. These strong disulfide bonds could otherwise make the foam brittle and more prone to breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Experimental comparison shows that an electric beater achieves stiff peaks in a copper bowl in 90 seconds, whereas a stainless steel bowl requires an additional 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. After half an hour, foam whipped in a copper bowl leaks significantly less water than foam whipped in stainless steel, indicating greater stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. A similar effect can be achieved by adding a pinch of cream of tartar or a squeeze of lemon juice to egg whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Alcohol Distillation
[[use_of_copper_in_alcohol_distillation | Copper's affinity for sulfur]] is also why it is traditionally used for [[use_of_copper_in_alcohol_distillation | distilling alcohol]] in copper vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Both traditional pot stills and modern column stills are commonly made of copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

During distillation, especially of brandies extracted from wine, sulfur compounds from the wine can vaporize and end up in the distillate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. While not tasted in wine, these sulfur compounds can impart an undesirable "rotten egg" taste in the finished spirit, even in very low amounts, due to the spirit's low pH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Copper bonds with some of the sulfur in the distillate, effectively pulling it out and improving the flavor of the spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Safety Concerns: Copper Leaching
Despite its benefits, copper's chemical reactivity poses [[safety_concerns_with_copper_cookware_and_moscow_mules | safety concerns with copper cookware]]. Common food acids can leach copper from unlined cookware into food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. While a small amount of copper is an essential micronutrient, large doses can be acutely toxic, and smaller but excessive doses over time can lead to chronic toxicity, causing nausea, vomiting, anemia, and liver and kidney diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Moscow Mules
The [[safety_concerns_with_copper_cookware_and_moscow_mules | Moscow Mule]] cocktail is a notable public health concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This popular acidic drink is traditionally served in a copper mug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. In 2017, Iowa made headlines by effectively banning unlined copper mugs in bars, allowing only those lined with inert materials like tin or stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

A study in the journal *Environmental Health*, co-authored by undergraduate students, demonstrated that a standard [[safety_concerns_with_copper_cookware_and_moscow_mules | Moscow Mule]] can extract dangerous levels of copper from an unlined mug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Surprisingly, ginger beer was found to be the primary culprit for copper leaching, not lime juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Copper leaching is time-dependent, meaning it takes a longer time for significant amounts of copper to be extracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Drinking the cocktail quickly can mitigate some risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

The perception of coldness from a copper mug also influences the drinking experience, as copper's high thermal conductivity causes the cup itself to feel very cold when holding a cold drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Furthermore, some people report tasting the copper, which seems to enhance the drink's flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Scientists speculate that the metallic taste might be a multi-sensory or even electrical experience, possibly related to copper interacting with proteins in saliva, enhancing astringency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Mitigating Reactivity: Linings and Sugar

### Lined Cookware
To prevent copper leaching into acidic foods, traditional [[benefits_and_characteristics_of_copper_cookware | copper pans]] are typically lined on the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Historically, tin was used as a lining, and more recently, stainless steel has become common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. High-quality stainless steel cookware often features layers of copper sandwiched inside for its excellent heat conductivity, which also prevents direct contact with food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Jam Pans
Despite the general rule for linings, unlined pure copper pots are still commonly used for making sweets, particularly jams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The presence of a high concentration of sugar in the solution appears to prevent copper from leaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This practice, common in French jam-making for centuries, leverages copper's superior thermal conductivity to cook jam very quickly, preserving volatile fruity aromas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Copper heats very evenly, preventing hot spots that could burn or seize syrups, which is critical for candy making that requires a lot of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

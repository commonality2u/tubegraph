The conventional method of cooking mushrooms involves using oil or another fat from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This approach is often seen as classical culinary dogma, particularly of French origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Despite common beliefs, this method can yield undeniably delicious results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

## Role of Oil in Cooking Mushrooms
[[role_of_oil_in_cooking | Oil]] serves as a thermal interface during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. It fills the gaps between the pan surface and the food, effectively transmitting heat into the mushroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Without oil, mushrooms tend to stick badly to a dry pan, resulting in burning in direct contact areas while the rest steams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

## Challenges with the Conventional Method
When [[role_of_oil_in_cooking | oil]] is used, several issues can arise:
*   **Oil Absorption:** Mushrooms, similar to bread, possess a fibrous structural network with air pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. This spongy structure readily absorbs the initial oil, causing the pan to feel dry after a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This often leads cooks to add more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **Water Release:** After a couple of minutes, the mushroom's hyphae network begins to break down, rupturing cells and releasing internal water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Spitting and Flooding:** The released water hits the hot oil, causing spitting and steam, which can make a mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. When cooking a large quantity of mushrooms (which is common since they shrink significantly), the pan can become flooded with water, causing the temperature to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Browning Inhibition:** Browning cannot occur in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. To achieve browning after the water release, one must wait for all the moisture to evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

## Preferred Approach for Conventional Cooking
To mitigate these issues, a common approach is to:
1.  **Start Hot and Fast:** Begin cooking at a very high temperature to achieve browning and color on the mushrooms before they release significant amounts of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.
2.  **Cook to Desired Shrinkage:** Continue cooking until the mushrooms have shrunk by about half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. At this point, the mushroom's structure is not fully collapsed, retaining some internal cavities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Resist Adding More Oil:** Even though mushrooms absorb a lot of oil initially, they will squeeze some of it back out as they cook and shrink, making the pan greasy again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

### Textural Characteristics
Mushrooms cooked conventionally with oil, especially when the water is not fully evaporated, tend to have a more pleasant texture due to not fully collapsing their internal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. A conventionally sauteed mushroom slice, when placed in water, will not plummet to the bottom, indicating residual air cavities within its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

## Comparison to [[wet_method_of_cooking_mushrooms | Water Trick]]
While the [[wet_method_of_cooking_mushrooms | water trick]] is a popular [[nontraditional_cooking_methods | nontraditional cooking method]], the conventional method with oil is often preferred for its textural outcome. The [[wet_method_of_cooking_mushrooms | water trick]] can lead to a "leathery" texture because mushrooms are often overcooked to evaporate all the water, which fully collapses their internal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. This results in an unpleasantly dense texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>, demonstrated by a water-cooked mushroom slice sinking like a stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

Despite the challenges, both methods are effective, and the results are very similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

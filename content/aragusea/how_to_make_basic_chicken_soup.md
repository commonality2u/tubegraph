Making a large quantity of nutritious and flavorful chicken soup from a whole small animal is a valuable life skill that allows you to feed yourself throughout the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This guide covers the process from stock creation to final seasoning.

## Ingredients & Equipment

For this recipe, a 4-pound (2 kg) chicken is standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. You will need your biggest pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> and various vegetables for flavor and substance.

## Making the Stock

### Chicken Preparation
Begin by rinsing the bag holding the chicken in the sink to contain mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Place the chicken into your largest pot, cutting the package open to keep juices contained, as they are edible and beneficial for the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Inside the chicken's cavity, you will likely find a bag containing giblets (gizzard, neck, liver, heart) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. These are excellent for stock, so add them directly to the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This process is part of [[using_whole_chicken_and_giblets_for_stock | using whole chicken and giblets for stock]] for a richer flavor profile.

### Water and Initial Simmer
Add water to the pot slowly to avoid splashing raw chicken juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. While filtered water from a fridge is often preferred for taste, tap water can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Culinary school practices suggest starting stock with cool water for a slightly less cloudy result, though it makes little difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Public health recommendations also advise using cool tap water, as hot tap water may contain dissolved lead or other contaminants from old pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Heat the pot on high with the lid on to retain energy and speed up heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Once it's actively bubbling, reduce the heat to a spirited simmer, cover, and let it cook for one to two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Vegetable Preparation

While the chicken simmers, prepare your vegetables. When making soup, remember that vegetables shrink significantly during cooking, so cut your chunks larger than desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Aim to use at least as much raw weight of vegetables as chicken, as a fresh meat stock enhances the flavor of vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This stage is crucial for [[vegetable_preparation_for_soup | vegetable preparation for soup]].

Common vegetables for chicken soup include:
*   **Zucchini**: Adds mucilage, which slightly thickens the soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Okra can achieve a similar effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Celery**: Rinse stalks thoroughly to clean dirt hidden between ribs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Save the leaves and core for a garnish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Slice the ribs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Onions**: Cut into half moons for a pleasing, slurpable shape, or dice finely for less texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Garlic**: Smash cloves to release skin, then chop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Carrots**: Scrub if not peeling, then slice into rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Parsnips**: Peel larger parsnips due to their size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. They offer a unique herbal note, like a cross between carrots and potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Quarter the fat ends before slicing, and slice thin ends into rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

You can use any vegetables you prefer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Cooking the Vegetables & Finishing the Soup

### Removing Chicken Meat
Simmer the chicken until it is very soft, allowing the meat to easily come off the bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Carefully drain hot broth from the chicken cavity before removing it to avoid scalding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Remove the old onion and discard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

While you can strain the broth or skim impurities (which are edible and cosmetic), it's not strictly necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. For a clearer broth, stir in an egg or two and simmer for a minute; the egg proteins will coagulate and trap particulates, which can then be skimmed off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Leave the rendered chicken fat, as it is delicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Once the chicken has cooled, pick the meat off the bones by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This allows you to feel for and remove any unwanted fatty bits or cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Since the meat will shred in the soup, run a knife through the picked meat a few times, cutting across the fibers, to prevent long, difficult-to-eat strings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Adding Vegetables and Seasoning
Add all prepared vegetables to the pot at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The liquid may seem insufficient at this stage, but the vegetables will release a lot of water as they cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Add a couple of big pinches of salt initially for the vegetables to absorb seasoning, but be conservative, as more can be added later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The vegetables will need at least a half hour of simmering to become soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

This forms the basis of [[seasoning_and_flavoring_chicken_soup | seasoning and flavoring chicken soup]]. For a Euro-American style soup, add plenty of pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> and turmeric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Turmeric provides a subtle flavor and the characteristic golden-yellow color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Once vegetables are soft, add the picked chicken meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. If desired, you can add dry noodles at this time, but use sparingly as they will expand greatly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Final Touches
At the last minute, stir in saved celery leaves and perhaps some fresh parsley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Herbs can also be added directly to individual bowls to keep them greener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

For a brighter flavor, a squeeze of lemon juice or a drop of vinegar can be added to individual servings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, as this keeps the flavor fresher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Frugal Tip: Re-using Scraps

To be even more frugal, you can take all the cooked bones, skin, and other scraps, brown them slightly in the oven to develop more flavor (since much flavor is already in the first soup) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Throw these into a pot, simmer for a couple of hours, and strain to make a second stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. While it won't have the same fresh taste as stock made with uncooked chicken, it will still have plenty of flavor and body, perfect for making a stew with whole grains, vegetables, butter, and herbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

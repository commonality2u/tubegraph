This recipe aims to recreate the "awesomely bad" roast beef au jus often found at cheap weddings and office Christmas parties, known for its super-thin slices served under a heat lamp [00:00:00].

## The Cut: Eye of Round

The eye of round is an inexpensive cut, typically from the "round" area of the cow, which is generally considered the "worst large area of meat" on the animal [00:00:17]. However, the eye of round is described as the "best of the worst" [00:00:28].

*   **Nomenclature**: In the States, it's called "eye of round roast" [00:00:31]. Brits might refer to it as "eye of rump" [00:00:32].
*   **Muscle**: It is the semitendinosus muscle [00:00:35].
*   **Size & Servings**: A typical eye of round weighs three or four pounds (one and a half kilos) and can feed eight people [00:00:36].
*   **Structure for Slicing**: The eye of round is well-suited for thinly sliced roast beef due to its grain structure, featuring "very long straight muscle fibers running exactly parallel to the overall shape of the roast" [00:00:43]. Slicing across these fibers significantly tenderizes the meat [00:00:52], which is beneficial as it is inherently tough [00:00:55].
*   **Fat Cap**: Ideally, the butcher leaves a thick fat cap, which melts in the oven and helps baste the roast [00:00:57]. Otherwise, this roast is very lean [00:01:02].

## Preparation

1.  **Seasoning**: Coat the roast generously with olive oil, a significant amount of black pepper, and two or three large pinches of salt to season the entire surface area [00:01:03].
2.  **Preheating**: Place a large oven-safe pan on medium-high heat to preheat [00:01:13]. Preheat the oven to 170°F (75°C), or the lowest temperature your oven allows, as precision is less critical at such low temperatures [00:01:16]. This sets up for an incredibly [[roasting_techniques_for_turkey | slow roast]], which aids in tenderizing the meat [00:01:30].
3.  **Garlic**: Smash a head of garlic [00:01:35]. If there is no black mold on the skin, there's no need to remove it; simply smash each clove to open it up [00:01:44].

## Slow Roasting Process

1.  **Initial Sear**: Place the roast in the hot pan fat-side down first [00:01:51]. The goal is to create brown, seared flavor, as extreme slow roasting itself does not achieve this [00:01:56]. Sear the roast on all sides, except for the side opposite the fat cap, which should be avoided for now [00:02:11].
2.  **Flavoring**: Once all other sides are seared, add a large knob of butter, the crushed garlic, and a bunch of rosemary or thyme sticks to the pan [00:02:20].
3.  **Positioning**: Roll the roast around in the butter and aromatics, then finally position it with the fat cap on top so it can baste the roast as it melts [00:02:29]. The side opposite the fat cap (the previously unseared side) should be positioned almost raw when it goes into the oven to prevent overcooking as it sits in the hot pan [00:02:39].
4.  **Cooking Time**: At these low oven temperatures, it will take approximately five or six hours to reach medium-medium rare doneness [00:02:47]. This is typically a weekend meal [00:02:54].
5.  **Monitoring**: After a couple of hours, roll the roast again in the flavored butter and insert a probe thermometer [00:05:43]. Due to the uniform temperature achieved by extreme low-temperature roasting, finding the "coolest spot" (dead center) is less critical than with conventional roasting [00:06:01].
6.  **Doneness**: Roast until the internal temperature reaches 130°F (55°C) for medium-medium rare [00:06:30]. This temperature might seem high, but because of the low roasting temperature, there will be almost no carryover cooking [00:06:40]. The meat should be roasted to the exact final temperature desired [00:06:47]. A roast cooked this way can even be lifted with bare hands immediately after cooking because of the low external temperature [00:06:45]. This slow-roasting method yields incredibly evenly cooked and tender meat [00:01:56].

## Au Jus Sauce

1.  **Initial Steps**: With the roast out of the oven, crank the oven up to 400°F (200°C) [00:06:51]. Heat the pan with the pan drippings, garlic, and herbs on high to fry the aromatics and build more brown flavor [00:06:57].
2.  **Deglazing**: Deglaze the pan with about half a cup of red wine [00:07:05], scrubbing the bottom of the pan to release browned bits [00:08:12]. Cook with red wine carefully, as too much can make the sauce bitter [00:08:08].
3.  **Stock**: Add a quart of beef stock (approximately 800ml) and bring to a boil [00:08:15].
4.  **Mushroom Flavoring**: The traditional "au jus" in this context is a meaty, unthickened sauce [00:08:27]. Flavoring it with mushrooms provides a necessary umami boost [00:08:31]. Powdered dried mushrooms are preferred over fresh, as fresh mushrooms proved ineffective [00:08:35]. A seasoning blend containing salt, onion powder, dried mushroom powder, and ground mustard seeds works well [00:08:42]. If a similar product is unavailable, dried mushrooms can be ground in a spice grinder [00:08:51]. Start with a tablespoon of dried mushroom powder [00:09:02], adding more to taste, along with onion powder and dried mustard [00:09:09]. Dried mushrooms have an incredibly strong and distinct flavor from fresh ones [00:09:04].
5.  **Thickening (Optional)**: While traditional au jus is unthickened, many US-sold roast beef au jus sauces are slightly thickened [00:09:24].
    *   **Cornstarch**: Two teaspoons of cornstarch mixed into a little water to form a slurry, then poured into the boiling sauce, will work perfectly [00:09:34].
    *   **Xanthan Gum**: For "a little thickening," xanthan gum is an effective alternative, available in grocery stores [00:09:42]. It disperses in oil, so mix half a teaspoon into a small dish of olive oil before adding to the sauce [00:09:48]. Xanthan gum is potent and can give a "mucousy texture" if too much is used, but in small amounts, it provides a "preternaturally smooth silky mouthfeel" [00:10:07]. Unlike cornstarch, xanthan gum maintains consistent thickness regardless of the sauce's temperature [00:10:28].
6.  **Finishing**: Reduce the sauce by about a third [00:10:19]. Strain it to remove garlic skins and herb sticks [00:10:22]. Pour any accumulated juice from the rested meat into the au jus [00:11:17].

## Slicing and Serving

1.  **Slicing**: Use an electric knife or a very long carving knife to cut the roast into slices "literally as thin as you can get them" [00:10:43]. It's acceptable if the slices are not perfectly pretty [00:10:50]. This thin slicing across the meat fibers, combined with the [[cooking_techniques_for_less_tender_cuts | long slow cooking]] [00:11:00], makes the formerly tough meat pull apart easily [00:11:03]. The texture is still that of roast beef, not [[braising_methods_for_beef | braised beef]] [00:11:10], but significantly more tender [00:11:14].
2.  **Reheating**: A well-rested piece of meat sliced this thin will go cold immediately [00:11:21]. The best solution is to reheat the au jus sauce (e.g., in a microwave) until piping hot, then pour it over the beef on the plate to reheat it [00:11:32].
3.  **Plating**: Instead of saucing the meat, flood the plate with the thin au jus [00:11:48]. For a full "company Christmas party kitsch" presentation, add a decorative sprig of curly parsley [00:12:00].

## Lazy Duchess Potatoes (Side Dish)

This is a lazy version of Duchess potatoes, a kitschy catering classic [00:02:58].

1.  **Potatoes**: Use three or four pounds of Yukon Gold potatoes, roughly equal in weight to the roast [00:03:04]. Any potato type would work [00:03:08].
2.  **Peeling**: Peeling is not necessary for Yukon Gold potatoes, as their skins are nutritious, taste good, and look pretty [00:03:10]. However, russet or other floury varieties should be peeled because their skins can be gross when cooked with wet heat [00:03:15].
3.  **Solanine Warning**: Inspect potatoes for any green spots, which indicate the presence of solanine, a natural poison formed when potatoes are exposed to light [00:03:22]. While a small amount is not harmful, trim off any visible green areas as they are bitter [00:03:33].
4.  **Cooking**: Cut potatoes into smaller pieces for faster and more even cooking [00:03:39]. Place them in a giant pot of cold water and then bring to a boil [00:03:42]. Starting with cold water prevents splashing if the water were already boiling [00:03:52]. Reduce heat as needed to prevent bubbling over [00:04:01].
5.  **Doneness**: Potatoes are done when fork-tender [00:04:26], a visual cue is when the skins begin to break off [00:04:28]. Drain the potatoes through a gap in the lid of the pot to save dishwasher space [00:04:31].
6.  **Mashing & Flavoring**: Return the pot to the stove with the heat off, as residual heat is sufficient to melt a stick of butter (4 ounces/113 grams) [00:04:37]. Once almost melted, dump in eight ounces of cheddar cheese (a quarter kilo), grind in plenty of pepper (white pepper is traditional but optional), and a big pinch of salt [00:04:44]. Nutmeg is traditional but disliked and omitted here [00:04:52].
7.  **Mixing**: Use a hand mixer to mash the potatoes very smoothly [00:04:56]. Yukon Golds are resistant to becoming gluey, unlike other potato varieties [00:05:00].
8.  **Liquid**: Duchess potatoes are traditionally made with cream, but a mixture of butter and milk can be used to achieve a consistency slightly stiffer than mashed potatoes [00:05:07]. Adjust milk quantity to achieve desired texture [00:05:12].
9.  **Egg Yolks**: Add four separated egg yolks [00:05:13]. These provide delicious flavor and help the potatoes brown and bind in the oven [00:05:27]. (The egg whites can be cooked later, not consumed raw) [00:04:20].
10. **Baking**: Traditional Duchess potatoes involve piping shapes onto a baking sheet [00:05:32]. As an experiment, the recipe attempted scooping them into a muffin tin, wiping each cup with melted butter [00:06:10]. However, the mixture was too loose, and they did not come out whole [00:10:38].
11. **Recommendation**: Instead of muffin tins, it is recommended to bake the potato mixture in one large casserole dish [00:12:19]. Bake the potatoes in the oven at 400°F (200°C) after the roast is removed [00:06:51].
12. **Result**: The potatoes, despite their appearance, are described as "awesome," like a cross between baked potatoes and mash [00:12:17].

From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Rösti is a national dish of Switzerland, particularly prevalent in German-speaking regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It can be served as a breakfast item or a side dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. At its core, it is a potato pancake consisting of potatoes, salt, and fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite its simple ingredients, there are many slight [[differences_in_rsti_preparation_techniques | differences in technique]] that people use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Preparation Methods

The video explores eight different methods for preparing Rösti, focusing on [[using_parboiled_vs_raw_potatoes_for_rsti | potato preparation]] and cooking techniques.

### Rösti #1: Parboiled Potatoes

This method is considered to have particular traditional credibility in Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

*   **Potatoes:** Boil potatoes until they soften slightly on the inside but remain firm enough to grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. If cooked too long, they will crumble into mash when grated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Chilling:** Many recipes recommend chilling the parboiled potatoes overnight in the fridge before grating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Peeling:** Traditional recipes suggest peeling potatoes, but leaving thin skins (e.g., from Yukon Gold potatoes) on is fine, as they are nutritious and often go unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Grating:** Use large holes on a box grater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Parboiling dries out the potatoes, so there's not much excess water to squeeze out post-grating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Cooking:**
    *   Use a nonstick pan (e.g., 8-inch/20cm for a small Rösti) with a generous amount of clarified butter or other fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Press the grated potatoes into an even layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   Cook on medium-low heat for about 10 minutes per side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The whole cake needs to cook and solidify before flipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Be conservative with heat to avoid burning the bottom before it's ready to flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   Flip by covering the pan and turning it out onto a plate, then sliding it back into the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   Cook the second side until golden and solid (around 8 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Result:** This method yields a slightly fluffy texture in the center, almost on the verge of mashed potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Rösti #2: Raw Potatoes (Not Parboiled)

*   **Potatoes:** Use raw, grated potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. They feel much wetter than parboiled potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Water Squeezing:** A significant amount of water needs to be squeezed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Cooking:** Raw potatoes can brown very easily due to starchy water residue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Result:** This version is crispier on the outside but can be slimy in the center due to the wet, starchy residue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Rösti #3: Rinsed Raw Potatoes

This method attempts to address the sliminess of raw potato Rösti.

*   **Potatoes:** Grate raw potatoes and rinse them in cool tap water to wash off free starch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Rinsing can be done twice for a cleaner result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Result:** The shreds feel very clean and separate, almost like coarse hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. However, the starch acts as a binder, and without it, the cake may not bind well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This can lead to burning the surface before the interior sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The interior texture is preferred as it's not slimy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The crispy surface is less pronounced without the starch goo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Rösti #4: Matchstick Cut Potatoes

*   **Cutting:** Instead of grating, potatoes are cut into matchsticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Fancy chefs sometimes use this technique, claiming longer pieces hold the cake better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Moisture:** Larger pieces have less surface area and bleed less water, so salting and letting them sit for about half an hour helps draw out moisture, allowing them to be squeezed dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Cooking:** This method requires extra time due to bigger pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Result:** Without advanced knife skills or a mandoline, the pieces might not be skinny enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The final product can resemble a "pile of worms" rather than a cohesive cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Rösti #5: Grated, Rinsed, and Baked (Preferred Method)

This method aims to get the best of both worlds: crispy exterior and non-slimy interior.

*   **Potatoes:** Grate raw potatoes and rinse them quickly to remove most, but not necessarily all, free starch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Squeeze dry and season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Cooking:**
    *   Brown only the bottom of the Rösti in the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   Transfer the pan to an oven preheated to 350°F (180°C) for about 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Baking helps cook the potatoes and bind them together without burning the bottom, even without the starch glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
    *   Flip, add more butter, and brown the second side on the stovetop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
    *   Optionally, return the entire Rösti (on a cooling rack) to the oven with a convection fan on for extra crisping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Result:** This was preferred for being crispy on the outside and not at all slimy on the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Rösti #6: Rinsed, Greased, and Baked

This is similar to method #5, with the addition of tossing the grated potato shreds with clarified butter before cooking.

*   **Potatoes:** Rinse and dry shreds, then toss with a little clarified butter and salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This is believed to help the cake hold together and cook faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Cooking:** Reduce the amount of fat in the pan to compensate for the fat mixed with the potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Follow the pan-to-oven method as in #5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Result:** The fat on the inside makes the whole thing super greasy, which was not preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Rösti #7: Mealy Potatoes (Russets)

This explores [[experimentation_with_potato_types_for_rsti | different potato types]], specifically mealy or baking potatoes (Russets).

*   **Potatoes:** Russets have thick, "cardboardy" skins which are peeled because wet bits of skin in the interior would be unpleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Yukon Golds are a good choice as they are a hybrid between waxy (hold shape when cooked) and mealy (fall apart when cooked) potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Cooking:** Follow the pan-to-oven method. Mealy potatoes should be cooked a little less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Result:** The interior of Rösti made with mealy potatoes turns into straight mashed potatoes, rendering the grating process somewhat pointless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### Rösti #8: Large Batch (Final Attempt)

A final attempt using a larger batch of potatoes and combining learned techniques.

*   **Potatoes:** A mixture of Russets and Yukon Golds (3 pounds/1.4 kilos) was used due to availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. They were rinsed, squeezed, and seasoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Cooking:** Cooked in a 10-inch (25cm) cast iron skillet with plenty of clarified butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Cast iron is less nonstick than Teflon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
    *   Brown the bottom on the stovetop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    *   Transfer to the oven for about 20 minutes due to the larger mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   Flip and brown the second side, then optionally return to the oven on a rack for a final crisping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Result:** Produced a really nice color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Thicker Rösti are harder to slice cleanly, as the crispy crust tends to cave in on the soft interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. For clean slices, a thinner Rösti is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Serving Suggestions

Rösti can be eaten with eggs or as a starch accompaniment to a stew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. A simple garnish of sour cream and dill can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Ultimately, even with varying techniques, most Rösti versions turn out "pretty good," and the differences are not enormous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

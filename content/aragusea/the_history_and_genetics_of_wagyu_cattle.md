Wagyu, literally meaning "Japanese cattle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, is a type of beef known for its extremely high cost, often hundreds of US dollars per pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While rumors circulate about cows receiving spa massages or bathing in sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, its special quality is primarily attributed to [[wagyu_beef_production_techniques_and_challenges | genetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Genetic Peculiarities

Japanese cattle, likely due to their long geographic isolation, possess several unusual traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The most notable is their exceptional ability to grow a significant quantity of intramuscular fat, also known as marbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This genetic predisposition is what makes Wagyu distinct.

Of the four main Japanese cattle breeds, the Japanese Black cattle breed is predominantly used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. An A5-graded Wagyu rib section, which signifies the highest possible grade (A for yield, 5 for marbling), can be literally half fat and half meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The intramuscular fat in Wagyu plays a crucial role in its texture. This fat disrupts the growth of connective tissue networks within the meat, effectively getting in the way of tough tissues linking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The result is weak muscles but extremely tender meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, contributing to a "spongy" quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Historical Development

While Wagyu's roots are ancient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, its meat was not always characterized by its signature "fatty snowflakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This distinctive marbling is the result of a significant change in trade policy that occurred in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

During the Uruguay Round of World Trade Organization negotiations in 1991, Japan agreed to allow imports of foreign beef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This development sparked terror among Japanese beef producers, who feared being outcompeted in their own market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Japan is not naturally suited for inexpensive beef production due to limited land, much of which is rocky, dedicated to rice, or urbanized, requiring imported grain for feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

To compete, Japanese farmers decided to focus on quality rather than price, transforming domestically grown Japanese beef into a luxury good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This shift involved:
*   Producing more steers (castrated males) and heifers (celibate females) instead of bulls and cows, as they yield fattier meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Increasing concentrated feed (grains like corn) significantly, as opposed to roughage like rice straw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Slaughtering Wagyu animals at an older age, typically around 30 months, to achieve fattier meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

These techniques, combined with Wagyu's unique [[wagyu_beef_production_techniques_and_challenges | genetics]], resulted in the "preposterous beef butter" known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This product was uniquely suited for the traditional Japanese way of eating, where small portions of rich meat accompany a large bowl of rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Global Wagyu and Authenticity

Japan did not export any beef until 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Therefore, "Kobe beef" ordered in places like New York before this time was either smuggled or, more likely, from a cow raised in the US with some Wagyu genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

Today, producers worldwide raise Wagyu beef, though purebred Wagyu remains scarce and expensive outside of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Wagyu calves are in short supply and can cost more than a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. As a result, much of the Wagyu produced globally is a crossbred variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Unique Properties

Beyond tenderness, Wagyu possesses a distinct "sweet umami" flavor and smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Recent research attributes this to its specific fatty acid composition, which breaks down into potent odorants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Wagyu has a high proportion of unsaturated fats, making its fat healthier gram for gram than other saturated animal fats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This unsaturated fat is also softer, contributing to its melt-in-your-mouth quality, even when raw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

In most English-speaking countries, "cider" refers to a low-alcohol, fizzy drink made from apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, in the United States, the term "cider" typically denotes a non-alcoholic, non-fizzy apple drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The alcoholic version is commonly known as "hard cider" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This distinction in [[differences_in_cider_terminology_between_the_us_and_uk | cider terminology]] is a significant divergence in United Statesian English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Historical Context

Historically, the word "apple" itself was a generic term for almost any bulbous, edible fruit in many Indo-European languages until as recently as the 17th century in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The modern word "apple" (Malus domestica) has been popular in Britain since at least Roman times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Its wild ancestor is native to Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Romans, Germanic settlers, and French-speaking Normans (after 1066) all contributed to spreading domesticated apple varieties in Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Britain's climate proved ideal for apple trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The [[the_history_of_apple_and_cider_terminology | etymological roots of "cider"]] indicate it has almost always referred to an alcoholic beverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This lineage traces back to the Hebrew word "shekhar" (strong drink or intoxicant) mentioned in Leviticus 10:8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Latin Christians translated it to "sikara," which evolved into "cedro" in Italian, "sidra" in Spanish, and an Old French term before becoming "cider" in English after the Normans brought it to England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Nonalcoholic Cider (US "Cider")

In the US, "cider" typically refers to unfiltered or cloudy apple juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This product emerged after Prohibition, first as "sweet cider" (unfermented apple juice) and then as "apple juice" through the industrialization of America's food system, which produced highly filtered versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. The cloudy, unfermented product became known as "cider" to distinguish it from the clearer "apple juice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Alcoholic Cider

### Natural Fermentation

Apple juice naturally tends to become alcoholic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Apples are naturally covered in yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. If unwashed apples are smashed into juice and not boiled or treated, it will likely become a weak alcoholic beverage within a couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Historically, people allowed this natural fermentation to occur, as the resulting alcohol helped make the drink safer than potentially contaminated local water supplies, and it was often consumed by children due to its low alcohol content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Controlled Fermentation

Making alcoholic cider typically involves fermenting apple juice. A common method, especially for first-time brewers, is to use pasteurized apple juice (such as Honeycrisp apple juice not from concentrate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Since pasteurization heats the juice to kill microorganisms, including wild yeast, a specific yeast strain must be added back in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. For example, a British ale yeast can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. After a few weeks, the [[process_of_yeast_fermentation_in_bread_making | fermented apple juice]] will begin to clarify, with sediment (yeast and pulp) settling at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The sugar content decreases as it converts to alcohol, typically resulting in about 5% alcohol by volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Apple Varieties for Cider

Alcoholic ciders are generally made using "cider apples," which are not typically suitable for eating due to their harsh or astringent taste from high tannin content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. These qualities, however, contribute depth and body to the fermented cider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Early English colonists in New England planted both dessert apples (for eating) and cider apples (for juicing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Traditional Stronger Alcoholic Products

Cider was a staple of Anglo-American colonial homesteads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Beyond drinking, it was used to make [[vinegar_production_and_fermentation_process | apple cider vinegar]] for food preservation and cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Colonists also converted cider into much stronger drinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. While cider can be distilled into brandy, a common method in frigid New England winters was to leave cider outside to freeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, but ethanol requires much colder temperatures (liquid nitrogen temperatures) to freeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This process of fractional freezing concentrates the ethanol, resulting in a high-alcohol beverage called "applejack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## Impact of Prohibition and Modern Terminology

The [[impact_of_prohibition_on_the_cider_industry_in_the_us | hard cider industry]] in the United States was largely wiped out by Prohibition in the early 20th century, unlike the beer industry which managed to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

When alcoholic cider made a commercial comeback in the US, it was termed "hard cider" to differentiate it from the already established non-alcoholic "sweet" or "soft" cider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The convention of using "hard" for alcoholic beverages and "soft" for non-alcoholic ones is a unique feature of American English, with examples dating back to the colonial period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. This may have descended from an older British English use of "hard" to describe harsh-tasting drinks, applied to alcoholic beverages due to alcohol's inherently harsh taste or less refined colonial spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

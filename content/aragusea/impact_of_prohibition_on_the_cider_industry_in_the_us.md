The Temperance Movement, particularly fervent among descendants of English Puritans, eventually led to [[cultural_influences_on_cider_consumption_and_production | Prohibition]] in the early 20th century, banning alcoholic beverages across the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

While the beer industry managed to survive Prohibition, the "hard cider" industry did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Historians continue to debate the exact reasons, but the hard cider industry was "completely wiped out" and "dead" on the other side of Prohibition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Post-Prohibition Landscape

From the "ashes" of the defunct hard cider industry, new products emerged:
*   **Sweet Cider**: Unfermented apple juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Apple Juice**: The industrialization of America's food system introduced highly filtered and refined cider, which was marketed as "apple juice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

To distinguish between these non-alcoholic products, the cloudy equivalent of apple juice became known as "cider" in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. By the time these products competed, alcoholic cider was largely absent from the US market, though some individuals with orchards likely continued to make it at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## Re-emergence of Hard Cider

When Americans eventually rediscovered the appeal of alcoholic cider and began commercial production again, they introduced the term "hard cider" to differentiate it from the sweet or soft cider (which was by then simply called "cider") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This distinction between "hard" for alcoholic beverages and "soft" for non-alcoholic ones is a unique feature of American English, with examples dating back to the colonial period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. It may have evolved from an older British English use of "hard" to describe harsh-tasting drinks, possibly due to the less refined or smoother alcoholic products produced in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

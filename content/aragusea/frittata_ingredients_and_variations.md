The frittata is described as a perfect egg dish due to its versatility, speed, and affordability, requiring virtually no skill to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Core Components

*   **Eggs:** The base of any frittata, typically using two to three eggs per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The video uses "cage-free eggs" from Berry College, noted for their "super golden yellow yolks" due to a natural forage diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Milk or Cream:** A "glug" of milk or cream can be added for a softer texture, though some believe it can make eggs slimy or cause water separation if overcooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Seasoning:** Freshly ground pepper is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Additional salt may not be needed if salty ingredients like prosciutto and cheese are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Solid Add-ins

The principle for solid ingredients is that they should be basically cooked by the time the eggs are poured in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Thin slices or bits of anything are sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Recommended Categories

A basic [[preparing_a_frittata | frittata]] formula includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>:
*   Some kind of onion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Some kind of cured pork product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   Some kind of green vegetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Some kind of fresh herb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Examples of Ingredients

*   **Shallots:** One or two shallots, thinly sliced, are cooked first to caramelize and become sweet, reminiscent of a Spanish [[different_egg_cooking_styles_sunny_side_up_crispy_basted_over_easy_scrambled_eggs_omelette | omelet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Cured Meats:** Prosciutto (three slices) is used, but any thin meat like bacon, pancetta, or salami works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Rolling the meat up can make it easier to cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Allowing the meat to get crispy in the pan is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Leftovers:** [[cooking_techniques_for_frittata | Frittata]] is excellent for incorporating leftovers, such as steamed broccoli, which should be chopped into small bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Cooked leftovers are added just before the eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Fresh Herbs:** Dill is used, but any fresh herb is suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Herbs should be added just before the eggs to prevent overcooking and browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Cheese:** Smoked Gouda from Berry College's dairy is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. An ounce or two is grated, with half mixed into the eggs and the remainder sprinkled on top to brown under the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Any cheese can work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Ingredient Ratios

There is no need to precisely measure ingredients, as a [[preparing_a_frittata | frittata]] is forgiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A general guideline is to have the egg mixture and the solid ingredient mixture be roughly equal in volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

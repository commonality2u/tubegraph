Having [[how_to_make_and_store_extra_pizza_dough | extra dough]] on hand is ideal for culinary experimentation, especially with new pizza recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16">[01:16]</a>. If you've invested time in making and potentially [[aging_pizza_dough | fermenting]] your [[Pizza dough ingredients and preparation | dough]] for days, it's wise to test new, unfamiliar [[alternative_methods_of_baking_pizza | pizza]] concepts with spare portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26">[01:26]</a>. This approach ensures that if a new recipe doesn't turn out as expected, you won't be disappointed, especially after having already enjoyed a traditional pizza the night before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31">[02:31]</a>.

## Summer Squash Pizza Experiment

A prime example of such an experiment is a summer squash pizza, inspired by a Smitten Kitchen recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21">[01:21]</a>.

### Ingredients & Preparation

The topping for this experimental pizza involves:
*   **Grated Squash** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40">[01:40]</a>: Two grated squash are used.
*   **Salt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42">[01:42]</a>: Approximately a teaspoon of salt is added to the grated squash to draw out moisture through osmosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43">[01:43]</a>. The moisture is then squeezed out and discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45">[01:45]</a>.
*   **Gruyère Cheese** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48">[01:48]</a>: Four to five ounces (about 120 grams) of Gruyère are mixed in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49">[01:49]</a>. This cheese is chosen for its stronger flavor compared to mozzarella, to compensate for the absence of a robust sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57">[01:57]</a>.
*   **Breadcrumbs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06">[02:06]</a>: Panko breadcrumbs are scattered on top before baking to provide browning and textural contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09">[02:09]</a>.
*   **Optional Garlic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02">[02:02]</a>: While the original recipe was followed, a strong instinct to add garlic was present, and it was later concluded that the pizza would benefit from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27">[02:27]</a>.

### Baking Process

The pizza is baked on a [[alternative_methods_of_baking_pizza | pizza]] steel that has been preheating at maximum temperature for about an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13">[02:13]</a>. The broiler is typically turned on halfway through baking to ensure the top browns adequately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16">[02:16]</a>.

### Results and Learning

Even when using [[how_to_make_and_store_extra_pizza_dough | frozen dough]] (which thaws quickly and retains its quality for [[alternative_methods_of_baking_pizza | flatbreads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20">[02:20]</a>), the results are impressive. The crust still puffs up well around the rim, achieving a nice crispiness and a brown bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22">[02:22]</a>. The summer squash recipe is considered delicious, though the addition of garlic would further enhance its flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27">[02:27]</a>. This outcome underscores the value of experimentation with [[how_to_make_and_store_extra_pizza_dough | extra dough]], as there's no downside when you're simply trying something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31">[02:31]</a>.

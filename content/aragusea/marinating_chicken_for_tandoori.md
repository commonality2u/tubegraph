[[preparing_tandoori_chicken_at_home | Indian American restaurant-style tandoori chicken]] is well-suited for home cooking due to its ease of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The marinating process is key to its flavor and texture.

## Chicken Selection and Preparation
For tandoori chicken, using one cut of chicken, such as legs, simplifies the cooking process as all pieces will be done at roughly the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:37">[02:15:37]</a>. Dark meat is recommended because it tastes better and is much more forgiving, resisting overcooking and instead becoming soft and sticky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>.

Before marinating, score the chicken with a few deep cuts down to the bone. This helps the chicken cook faster and creates more delicious surface area for flavor penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Marinade Ingredients and Application
It's recommended to prepare the marinade directly on the chicken rather than mixing it into a paste beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Use a stainless steel bowl for marinating, avoiding materials like non-anodized aluminum that can react with acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

The ingredients should be applied in a specific order:

1.  **Salt** Apply salt first, eyeballing the amount needed for the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
2.  **Masala** Next, apply the [[spice_mixture_for_tandoori_chicken | masala]] (spice mixture), aiming for a heavy but not excessive dusting. Too much can lead to a powdery or pasty texture in the finished dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
3.  **Kashmir Chili Powder** This ingredient is crucial for achieving a beautiful red color without overwhelming heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, resulting in mild to moderate heat for most palates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
4.  **Ginger Garlic Paste** Bottled ginger garlic paste is a convenient option that saves effort without a noticeable difference in heavily cooked dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Use a couple of spoonfuls; too much can result in a gross texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
5.  **Lemon Juice** The juice of one lemon is sufficient. Strong acids like lemon can chemically cook the meat if given too much time, leading to a mushy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
6.  **Yogurt** Full-fat Greek yogurt is a good substitute for traditional curd, offering a thick consistency that isn't too wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Only about half a cup is needed for five pounds of meat and bone, as any excess will need to be scraped off before cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. The goal is a thick paste covering the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

### Optional Ingredient
Food coloring can be added to achieve the "candy apple red" color often seen in restaurant tandoori chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

## Marination Time
After applying all ingredients, cover the bowl. The chicken can be cooked right away, but the flavor will intensify if allowed to sit for a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not marinate for more than a day, as the chicken can become mushy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. The lemon juice in the marinade can chemically cook the meat if left for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

Once marinated, the chicken is ready for [[roasting_chicken_techniques | roasting]] or [[how_to_properly_sear_chicken_thighs | searing]].

[[what_is_malt|Malt]] is a truly magical ingredient, both simple and complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Simply put, [[what_is_malt|malt]] is any cereal grain that has been allowed to germinate or sprout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This process involves starting to grow into a new plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Sprouted grain is particularly nutritious and full of [[enzymes_and_malting_process|enzymes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Malting Process and Grain Selection
The first step to making [[what_is_malt|malt]] is to use intact, whole grain that has been dried into dormancy but is still viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. While wheat can be malted, barley is the most popular grain for [[what_is_malt|malt]] production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Other grains like rice, rye, oats, and corn can also be malted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Barley is preferred for several reasons:
*   **Low Gluten Content** Barley has much less gluten than wheat, allowing the "wort" (sweet liquid) to drain cleanly during brewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Wheat and corn, when mashed, can become gummy due to their proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Ease of Growth** Barley is easy to grow, even in cold climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Mild Taste** It has a nice, mild taste, unlike strong-tasting rye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Poor for Bread** Since barley has very little gluten, it is terrible for making bread, making it ideal for [[what_is_malt|malt]] production instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

The malting process involves:
1.  **Washing and Soaking** Grains are washed to remove debris and microorganisms, then submerged in water to soften them and kickstart the germination process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Soaking the seeds to just under 50% hydration activates proteins and causes cells to produce [[enzymes_and_malting_process|amylases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
2.  **Sprouting** After soaking, grains are laid out to sprout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The appearance of rootlets and an acrospire (the part that grows above ground) indicates successful sprouting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
3.  **Halting Growth** Once the acrospire is almost as long as the seed itself, the process is stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This is done by drying the grain to kill the plant and preserve the starches, while ensuring a high concentration of active [[enzymes_and_malting_process|amylase enzymes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Diastatic Malt
Diastatic [[what_is_malt|malt]] refers to [[what_is_malt|malt]] that retains its enzymatic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. The term "diastatic power" measures the [[what_is_malt|malt]]'s ability to convert starch into sugar, or the percentage of remaining [[enzymes_and_malting_process|amylase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Base Malt
*   **Production** [[what_is_malt|Malt]] dried slowly at lower temperatures (below 149째F / 65째C) to prevent denaturing the [[enzymes_and_malting_process|enzymes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Higher temperatures (above 180째F / 85째C) would rapidly cook and deactivate the [[enzymes_and_malting_process|amylase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Base malts have a very high diastatic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Uses**
    *   **Baking** Bakers use [[enzymes_and_malting_process|amylase]] from [[what_is_malt|malt]] to break down starches in flour into sugars that yeast can eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This allows the yeast to produce carbon dioxide, which makes bread dough rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Some flours even come with [[what_is_malt|malt]] flour or [[enzymes_and_malting_process|enzymes]] added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
    *   **Brewing and Distilling** Brewers and distillers crush diastatic or base [[what_is_malt|malt]] with other grains and soak them in water to create a "mash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Warming the mash allows the [[enzymes_and_malting_process|amylase]] to break down starches into fermentable sugars, creating a sweet liquid called "wort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Yeast then ferments these sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide to make beer or a liquid that can be distilled into whiskey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Non-Diastatic Malt
Non-diastatic [[what_is_malt|malt]] has been processed in a way that deactivates its [[enzymes_and_malting_process|enzymatic power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This is typically achieved through roasting at high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

### Roasted Malts
*   **Production** After the grains are sprouted and dried, they are roasted at high temperatures. This process causes browning reactions between proteins and sugars, creating a variety of flavor compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The darker the roast, the less [[enzymatic power]] the [[what_is_malt|malt]] retains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Uses** Roasted malts are primarily used for flavor and color, not for their [[enzymatic activity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
    *   **Brewing** Brewers use different combinations of roasted malts to create distinct beer styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Lighter roasted malts can taste like a milkshake, while super dark roasted malts can taste like cocoa powder or coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
    *   **Whiskey** In Scotland, some whisky makers expose their [[what_is_malt|malt]] to peat smoke during drying to impart a smoky taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
    *   **Baking** Bakers also use non-diastatic [[what_is_malt|malt]] powder for flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. The [[what_is_malt|maltose]] present helps make bread crusts really brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Malt Syrup
*   **Production** Instead of fermenting the wort with yeast, the sweet liquid can be boiled down into a syrup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This syrup is non-diastatic because the high heat deactivates the [[enzymes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Uses** [[what_is_malt|Malt]] syrup adds its particular malty flavor and color to baked goods, such as New York-style bagels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Malted Milk Powder
*   **Production** Developed in the late 19th century by James Horlick, malted milk powder combines [[what_is_malt|malt]] powder with milk powder and wheat flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. It is designed to be an easily digestible and shelf-stable drink mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Uses**
    *   Initially for babies and sick people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
    *   Popular as a preserved energy drink for outdoor enthusiasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
    *   Found popularity in milkshakes, often with chocolate added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
    *   Used to make malted milk balls (e.g., Whoppers) by baking it into a hard biscuit and coating it in chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

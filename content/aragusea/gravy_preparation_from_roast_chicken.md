Gravy is an essential component of a classic roast chicken meal, and a specific [[roasting_chicken_techniques | roasting chicken technique]] can result in especially good gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Benefits of the Roasting Method for Gravy
The method of pre-cooking the bottom of the chicken on the stovetop creates an "incredible layer of Fond" in the pan, which is crucial for gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Roasting at a high temperature also ensures that most of the chicken's juices evaporate, leaving behind a concentrated base that doesn't require a gravy separator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This means the remaining drippings are essentially straight fat, ideal for making a roux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Gravy Preparation Steps

### 1. Separate Chicken and Drippings
After the chicken is done roasting, remove it from the pan and let it rest on a plate to collect any additional juices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### 2. Manage the Fat
The pan will contain a substantial amount of rendered chicken fat and Fond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. While all of it can be used, it often yields more gravy than needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Approximately half of the fat can be poured off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This excess fat can be used in mashed potatoes in place of some butter, or in addition to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### 3. Create the Roux
Place the pan with the remaining fat and Fond over medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Once sizzling, whisk in just enough flour to create a thick paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Cook this roux for about a minute until the flour develops a nutty aroma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### 4. Deglaze and Simmer
*   **Liquids:** Begin by whisking in a little white wine for sweetness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, then add water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> (carton stock can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>). The initial color may not be appetizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Flavor Development:** Simmer the gravy for five to ten minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. During this time, the brown bits (Fond) will dissolve and impart their color and flavor to the gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Additional Flavorings:** The shallot and herbs placed inside the chicken during roasting can be added to the gravy for extra flavor, either whole or chopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. If you enjoy a lemony gravy, squeeze in the lemon from the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Resting Juices:** Pour any juices collected from the resting chicken back into the gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### 5. Season and Adjust Consistency
Grind in pepper and start with a pinch of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The gravy will thicken as it cools, so it's often necessary to add a little more water to achieve the desired consistency when it's still hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Continue to taste and adjust seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### 6. Final Touches
The gravy is ready when it's well-seasoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Chunks are often preferred, but the gravy can be strained if a smoother texture is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The chicken fat in the roux gives the gravy a desirable glossy appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Gravy is excellent over potatoes and can also be used on white meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

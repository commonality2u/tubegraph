Cast iron is an ancient material with a long history in various applications, including cookware.

## Origins and Early Production
The earliest known production of cast iron dates back to the 5th century BCE in China, specifically in what is now the Jiangsu province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Europeans did not adopt cast iron until the 14th century CE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## What is Cast Iron?
Cast iron is generally defined as an iron-carbon alloy containing at least two percent carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The carbon content is responsible for its black appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The "cast" in its name refers to the manufacturing process: iron is melted and then poured into a mold, typically made out of sand, to shape it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This casting process makes cast iron the least expensive way to create a thick, heavy pan in virtually any desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Longevity and Durability
Cast iron cookware is renowned for its durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Many people today still use cast iron pans that are a hundred years old or even older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Its one-piece, integrated construction, resulting from being cast in three-dimensional molds, contributes to its strength and makes it far more durable than cookware with bolted-on handles, such as many stainless steel pans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Historical Maintenance Practices
Historically, [[Maintenance and seasoning of cast iron pans | cast iron pan maintenance]] involved considerations that have evolved over time. In the past, soaps often contained lye, which would degrade the pan's seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Modern soaps, however, typically do not use lye as a primary base, making them safer for cleaning seasoned cast iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

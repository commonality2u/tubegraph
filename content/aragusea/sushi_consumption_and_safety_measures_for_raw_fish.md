The consumption of fish varies by species, but sushi, which often involves raw fish, is currently very popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

## Expert Perspective

Dr. Francisco Diaz Gonzalez, director of the Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, expresses some hesitation about consuming raw fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This perspective may stem from his occupational expertise in foodborne pathogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

Despite expert caution, the scientific literature indicates that there are not many reported cases of illness directly linked to sushi consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Safety Measures: Flash Freezing

One significant reason for the relative safety of sushi is the practice of flash freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Even high-quality fish often undergoes this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Freezing is effective in killing certain pathogens, such as *Vibrio* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

This article details how to prepare an easy, cheap, and incidentally vegan Chinese-American restaurant-style garlic broccoli meal with steamed rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While not traditional Chinese cuisine, it's a riff on a classic strip mall restaurant dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Components of the Meal

### Steamed Rice Preparation

To make fluffy Chinese-style steamed rice:
1.  Start with about half a cup (100 grams) of rice per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  Wash and drain the rice a few times to remove free starch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
3.  Add 1.75 times the rice volume in plain water, with no salt for this style of rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
4.  Heat on high, uncovered, until it comes to a boil and the surface gets pockmarked, with the rice peaking above the water level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
5.  Cover, reduce heat, and steam for about 15 minutes, or until the rest of the dinner is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Garlic, Ginger, and Chili

For the aromatic base of the sauce:
*   Peel 3 to 4 cloves of garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Peel a thumb of ginger, roughly the same amount as the garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   Slice ginger across its fibers (against the grain) to make it easier to chop fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   Optionally, add about half a fresh chili <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Chop all ingredients finely and set aside in a small dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Broccoli Preparation

Broccoli is praised for its ability to absorb sauce and is substantial enough to be a main ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, especially if not overcooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

#### Steaming and Shocking
1.  Use a steep-sided saut√© pan, soup pot, or Dutch oven with a lid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  Add about an inch of water and use an expandable steamer basket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, broccoli can be boiled if a steamer is not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
3.  For two servings, use one medium to large broccoli crown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
4.  Stand the broccoli upside down to easily cut off florets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
    *   Once individual florets become too small, cut the whole tip and trim into 3-4 bite-sized pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
    *   The stem can be sliced and cooked or discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   Cut larger pieces in half or thirds; bigger pieces look prettier and will shrink slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
5.  Once the water is boiling, add all the broccoli to the steamer basket, piling it high if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
6.  Cover and cook for just three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
7.  While cooking, fill a large bowl with water and ice cubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
8.  Pull the broccoli just before it's fork-tender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
9.  Lift the entire basket into the ice bath and stir until every piece is cooled off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

> [!TIP] Blanching and shocking the broccoli deactivates enzymes that turn green into brown, preserving its bright green color and keeping the texture one step away from perfect. It can also stay perfect in the water for hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Steamed broccoli also has a brighter, fresher flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Garlic Sauce Ingredients

The sauce needs to be strong enough to flavor the plain broccoli and rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

*   **Aromatics:** Minced garlic, ginger, and chili (as prepared earlier) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Liquid:** 1 cup (240 ml) of water, broccoli water (from steaming), or stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Flavorings:**
    *   1 teaspoon onion powder (optional, but nice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   1/4 cup (60 ml) soy sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   A couple of teaspoons of any tangy mustard (as a substitute for vinegar and ground mustard seed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   A large spoonful of [[using_gelatin_and_vegan_alternatives | Marmite]] (yeast extract), which is vegan and provides umami, B vitamins, and gelatinous texture, replacing oyster or fish sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   1 tablespoon white sugar and a glug of molasses (to replicate brown sugar and add desired sweetness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   1-2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil (added at the end for flavor, as frying it at the beginning can cause bitterness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
    *   Ground pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
    *   A dash of Chinese five-spice (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   MSG (Accent brand name) or plain salt for seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Thickener:** 2 tablespoons cornstarch (or any refined starch) mixed into a slurry with enough cool water to dissolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Cooking the Sauce and Combining the Meal

1.  After draining the water from the pan, return it to medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
2.  Add a little plain cooking oil to film the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
3.  Fry the garlic, chili, and ginger for about a minute until soft and slightly golden, before it burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
4.  Pour in the water (or broccoli water/stock) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
5.  Add onion powder, soy sauce, mustard, [[using_gelatin_and_vegan_alternatives | Marmite]], sugar, molasses, pepper, and Chinese five-spice if using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
6.  Bring the sauce to a simmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
7.  While stirring continuously with one hand, drizzle in the cornstarch slurry with the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   This prevents starch globs from forming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
8.  Hold some slurry in reserve as the sauce will thicken further, and the broccoli will release water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
9.  Reduce heat once thickened to prevent sticking and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
10. Taste and adjust seasoning: it should be "too sweet, too sour, too salty, too umami" to adequately flavor the plain rice and broccoli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Add MSG or salt for more savory flavor, more mustard or vinegar for acidity, and more sugar if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
11. Add toasted sesame oil at this stage for flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
12. Gather the blanched broccoli, wring out excess water, and add it to the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
13. The broccoli will cook the last bit it needs as it warms up and gets coated in the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
14. If the sauce is too thick, splash in a bit more water, keeping it pretty gloopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
15. Serve the broccoli and sauce over the steamed rice, spooning excess sauce over the rice for flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
16. Garnish with whole sesame seeds if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

The final dish provides a satisfying "meaty sugar glaze" experience, despite being meatless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

The term "salad" in this context refers to a chopped, cold protein bound in a creamy dressing, typically mayonnaise, and flavored with various other ingredients, often eaten as a sandwich filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article focuses on [[creative_salad_variations_and_addins | chicken salad]] using a homemade mascarpone-style dressing.

## Preparing the Chicken Base
For [[creative_salad_variations_and_addins | chicken salad]], a grocery store rotisserie chicken is recommended due to its affordability, good taste, and soft texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The meat can be easily pulled apart into chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. When preparing the meat, start with chunks that feel a bit too large, as they will naturally break apart and shred as they are mixed with other ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The white meat from rotisserie chickens tends to be dry, but this is offset by the creamy dressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Homemade Mascarpone-Style Dressing
As a fancy alternative to mayonnaise, a homemade mascarpone-style dressing can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Traditional mascarpone cheese is often too thick and can be difficult to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Dressing Preparation
To make this dressing:
1.  Combine two cups of whipping cream (a pint or 400-500ml) in a pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
2.  Heat over medium heat until it barely reaches a simmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
3.  Juice in at least half a lemon; the entire lemon may be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The acid from the lemon will instantly coagulate and thicken the cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
4.  Unlike traditional mascarpone, this mixture does not need to be drained overnight through a cheesecloth, as it would then require thinning with water or milk to reach the desired consistency for chicken salad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
5.  Allow it to cool, resulting in a delicious spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

This homemade dressing is considered a "light option" compared to mayonnaise, being approximately 60% fat versus mayonnaise's 95% fat content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The lemon in the dressing helps to freshen up the taste of the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Additional Ingredients and Flavor Variations

### Onions
Green onions are a good alternative to shallots for their mild flavor when raw and a pleasant crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Slice the firm white end thinly and use progressively larger pieces for the green parts, which act like a fresh herb and add color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Sweetness and Acidity
Instead of sweet pickle relish, sweet corn kernels can be shaved off the cob to add a hit of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. For acidity and sweetness, fruit such as apple or grapes can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Grapes, for example, can be quartered for a nice addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Crunch and Texture
To provide additional crunch, any kind of nuts can be added, such as pistachios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. After shelling, the nuts should be smashed or chopped slightly, but not too finely, to maintain texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Seasoning
Season with pepper and a little salt to start, keeping in mind that rotisserie chickens are often already quite salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. A little parsley is a nice addition if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Garlic powder is also a good flavor enhancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## Storage and Serving Tips
After mixing, the [[creative_salad_variations_and_addins | chicken salad]] can be stirred thoroughly to ensure all ingredients are well combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. One consideration with the homemade cream dressing is that it stiffens up significantly in the fridge, unlike mayonnaise which maintains a consistent consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. It might be beneficial to let the salad warm up slightly before eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This [[creative_salad_variations_and_addins | chicken salad]] is a great option to prepare in advance for lunches over several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

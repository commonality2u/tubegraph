Mozzarella is widely considered the best cheese for pizza, backed by a 2014 study finding that only mozzarella or a mozzarella-based blend offers the desired browning and stretching properties expected of pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. However, the ideal type of mozzarella depends on the style of pizza being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Fresh Mozzarella

Fresh mozzarella is characterized by its high moisture content, milky texture, sweet, fresh, and subtle flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Historically, it originates from Italy and was often made from water buffalo milk, resulting in a soft, high-fat product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It is typically cut or torn rather than shredded due to its softness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### For [[innovative_sauce_and_flavor_combinations_for_pizza | Neapolitan Style Pizza]]

Fresh mozzarella is ideal for [[innovative_sauce_and_flavor_combinations_for_pizza | Neapolitan style pizza]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This style uses significantly less cheese, applied in splotches rather than a full sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Large chunks of fresh mozzarella are often placed over basil leaves to protect them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This approach prevents the pizza from becoming soggy, which would otherwise happen due to the cheese's high water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Neapolitan pizzas are typically baked at very high temperatures, such as 700째F (370째C) convection, often in tabletop ovens or wood-fired brick ovens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Challenges for [[making_new_yorkstyle_pizza_at_home | New York Style Pizza]]

When used for a [[making_new_yorkstyle_pizza_at_home | New York style pizza]] (wide, thin, with a solid sheet of cheese), fresh mozzarella results in a wet, soggy crust due to its excessive water content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Attempting to dry fresh mozzarella by pressing it with paper towels does not replicate the taste of low-moisture mozzarella, as its flavor profile is chemically altered during production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Low-Moisture Part-Skim Mozzarella

This type of mozzarella, often called "pizza cheese" in the industry, was developed in the United States after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. American cheesemakers, particularly in regions like Wisconsin, sought a more stable and less messy product for commercial mass production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The moisture is removed chemically rather than physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>:
*   Milk is standardized to a lower fat content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   Rennet (an enzyme) is added to coagulate the milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   Bacterial cultures ferment lactose, dropping the pH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   The cheese is then put through a cooker-stretcher and heated to around 60째C (140째F) to inactivate bacteria and enzymes, extending shelf life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

This process results in a firmer, more stable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Low-moisture mozzarella also has a sharper, more acidic taste compared to fresh mozzarella, which is crucial for [[making_new_yorkstyle_pizza_at_home | New York style pizza]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Brands like Grande use bacterial fermentation for acidification, while Palio (in the New York area) uses vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. When used for [[making_new_yorkstyle_pizza_at_home | New York style pizza]], it yields good browning, a crispy and dry crust, and a firmer cheese texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Whole Milk Low-Moisture Mozzarella

Often referred to as WM LM, this is the preferred cheese for many [[making_new_yorkstyle_pizza_at_home | New York style pizza]] cooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. It offers a richer flavor than part-skim varieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

However, it is harder to find in grocery stores for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>:
*   **Grease Layer**: Higher fat content can result in a more noticeable grease layer on the pizza, which general consumers might not prefer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Machinability**: Removing fat makes cheese firmer and easier to cut and shred by machine for large-scale manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Whole milk low-moisture mozzarella can sometimes be found at the deli counter (e.g., Boar's Head) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Historically, some full-fat low-moisture mozzarellas were sold molded into sticks, like the Galvani brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. While Walmart offers a whole milk low-moisture mozzarella, its quality might not be exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Brands like Palio sell their true low-moisture cheese in large commercial loaves, with retail versions often being a softer, "medium moisture" product that performs differently on pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## [[challenges_with_preshredded_mozzarella_cheese_for_pizza | Preshredded Mozzarella Cheese]]

While convenient, [[challenges_with_preshredded_mozzarella_cheese_for_pizza | preshredded mozzarella]] often contains an anti-caking blend, such as corn starch, potato starch, and calcium sulfate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This blend prevents the cheese from clumping in the bag but can interfere with melting and browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The anti-caking agents may not melt at pizza baking temperatures, creating a "battered" or "breaded" effect on the shreds, preventing the cheese from melting properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Additionally, they can soak up moisture released during baking, making the cheese surface too dry and prone to toasting or burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. These issues are often quality control problems at the factory, with some producers adding too much anti-caking mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Experimenting with different brands is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

Small differences in ingredient quality, particularly cheese, can significantly impact the final pizza product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

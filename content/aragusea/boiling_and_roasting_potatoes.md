This recipe for "oven fries" is designed to produce results so crunchy they might be mistaken for deep-fried potatoes, while being easier and cleaner to make at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The secret to their crunchiness lies in adopting a British approach to [[early_methods_of_cooking_and_roasting | roast potatoes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Potato Selection and Preparation

The recipe primarily uses large russet potatoes, with one potato per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. While the recipe can work with various potato types, russets are preferred. Peeling the potatoes is optional; it maximizes the starchy surface area for crisping but is not strictly necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

After peeling (if desired), cut the potatoes into your preferred fry shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It's important to ensure each fry is of roughly equal thickness for even cooking, even if their shapes vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The potatoes will shrink by about half during cooking, so initially, they should be thick, like steak fries, to prevent them from breaking apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Cutting them into wedges can make the process easier and results in a sturdier fry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

One advantage of this method over conventional deep-frying is the ability to cook a large batch, sufficient for four people, all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## The Boiling Step: The British Secret

Oven fries are technically [[early_methods_of_cooking_and_roasting | roast potatoes]], and the British are renowned for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Their secret is to boil the potatoes first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

*   **Process**: Place the cut potatoes in a saucepan with just enough water to cover them and bring to a high boil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. A lid can help them boil quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: This step makes the potato pieces fluffy, creating a fluffy interior and a starchy exterior that becomes incredibly crispy when roasted in fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Timing**: Boil until you're "terrified they're gonna fall apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. As Jamie Oliver suggested, boil them "as long as you dare." This typically takes about eight minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Draining**: Since the boiled potatoes are delicate, drain them gently by opening a small gap between the pot and the lid to let the water out, rather than dumping them into a colander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Oiling and Roasting

After boiling, transfer the delicate potatoes gently into a large roasting tray, spreading them into roughly a single layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Some breakage is acceptable, as these pieces will become extra crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

*   **Oil Choice**: Olive oil can be used for flavor, but a neutral oil like peanut oil will provide a more traditional fry flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Coating**: Pour a generous amount of oil directly onto the potatoes to ensure they are very well coated, rather than pouring it into the pan first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Gently shake the tray to coat all pieces and arrange them in a single layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The fluffy, beat-up surface of the potato is what will become incredibly crisp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Roasting**: Roast in a 450°F (232°C) oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
    *   **First Phase**: After about 45 minutes, flip the larger pieces and check for sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Add more oil if they appear dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Second Phase**: Give them another aggressive shake, as they will be more rigid now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Return them to the oven for another 45 minutes, or until desired crispness is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Time Commitment**: While the total cooking time is long (around 1.5 hours), most of it is unattended, allowing you to prepare other parts of the meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Doneness**: Be conservative with the cooking time; over-browning can lead to a slightly burnt taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The fries will firm up significantly as they cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Draining and Seasoning

For draining excess oil, a method inspired by Anthony Bourdain is recommended: place a towel in a large bowl, dump the fries into the towel, which will absorb the oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

After removing the towel, season the fries generously with coarse salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Additional seasonings can include garlic powder, pepper, chopped cilantro, and grated parmesan cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Toss everything together to coat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The result should be a glassy, crispy exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Benefits of the Method

*   **No Cleanup**: Eliminates the need to clean a giant pot of hot oil after dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Retention of Heat and Crispness**: These oven fries stay hot and crunchy for a surprisingly long time, offering about a 20-minute window to complete the rest of the meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

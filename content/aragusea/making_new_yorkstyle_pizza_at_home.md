This article provides an updated guide on how to make [[making_new_yorkstyle_pizza_dough_at_home|New York-style pizza]] in a [[challenges_of_achieving_professional_pizza_crust_in_a_home_oven|home oven]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## What is New York-Style Pizza?
[[making_new_yorkstyle_pizza_dough_at_home|New York-style pizza]] is characterized as a wide street food, designed for foldable slices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. It is typically as thin as possible for a [[challenges_of_achieving_professional_pizza_crust_in_a_home_oven|home oven]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> and features a solid layer of low-moisture mozzarella, unlike Neapolitan pizza which uses fresh mozzarella in splotches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## [[pizza_dough_preparation|Pizza Dough Preparation]]

### Equipment
While a stand mixer can be used for [[pizza_dough_preparation|pizza dough]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, it is not necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. All you need is a bowl, ideally a large one with a wide base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Ingredients and Mixing
1.  **Water:** Start with about 2.5 cups of warm water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  **Sugar:** Add one tablespoon of sugar, which helps the crust brown at lower [[challenges_of_achieving_professional_pizza_crust_in_a_home_oven|home oven]] temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
3.  **Yeast:** Incorporate one teaspoon of active dry yeast, mix, and let it sit for five minutes to rehydrate (called blooming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This step also verifies the yeast's activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
4.  **Olive Oil:** Add approximately two tablespoons of olive oil, which also aids in crust browning in a [[challenges_of_achieving_professional_pizza_crust_in_a_home_oven|home oven]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
5.  **Salt:** Add one tablespoon of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. A common myth is that salt kills yeast, but this amount will not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
6.  **Flour:** Use bread flour (higher protein content) for a chewier and stretchier dough, though all-purpose flour can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Start with five cups by volume, adding more by feel as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Wetter doughs are preferred for a lighter and crispier bake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Kneading
Combine ingredients with a spatula before kneading by hand in the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Push the dough down with the weight of your body behind your palm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Add minimal flour to keep the sticky dough workable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The dough is ready when it can be stretched thin without tearing (the "windowpane test") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This typically takes about 10 minutes of kneading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Dough Division and Oiling
This recipe yields enough dough for four [[challenges_of_achieving_professional_pizza_crust_in_a_home_oven|home oven]]-sized pizzas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
1.  Pour a little olive oil into four containers, each large enough for the dough balls to double in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
2.  Divide the dough into four equal balls, by eye or using a scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
3.  Shape them reasonably smooth and round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
4.  Use the dough balls to oil the inside of the containers, ensuring the balls themselves are well-covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The oil prevents drying out and helps the crust brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Cold Rise and [[aging_pizza_dough|Aging]]
Cover the dough balls and place them straight into the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. After at least 24 hours of cold rising, the dough is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The dough can [[aging_pizza_dough|age]] in the fridge for up to a week, improving with time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Baking Setup and [[baking_techniques_for_pizza_at_home|Baking Techniques for Pizza at Home]]

### Hot Surface
A pizza steel is recommended over a stone for better thermal conductivity in a [[challenges_of_achieving_professional_pizza_crust_in_a_home_oven|home oven]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Place the steel on the second-highest rack position for optimal top browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Oven Temperature
Preheat your oven to its highest setting, typically 550°F (288°C) on a convection roast setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Preheat the steel for a full hour to achieve a noticeably browner and crispier crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## [[selecting_the_right_cheese_for_new_yorkstyle_pizza|Cheese Selection for New York-Style Pizza]]

The defining [[selecting_the_right_cheese_for_new_yorkstyle_pizza|cheese selection]] for [[making_new_yorkstyle_pizza_dough_at_home|New York-style pizza]] is low-moisture mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Whole Milk Low-Moisture Mozzarella:** This version tastes significantly better than part-skim but is harder to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Walmart's whole milk low-moisture mozzarella is an option, despite not being a "great" cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Avoid Medium-Moisture Cheese:** Some cheeses, like Palio's retail version, are closer to medium-moisture and can be less dry and tangy than true low-moisture mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Commercial-grade whole milk low-moisture mozzarella (e.g., Palio's 7.5lb loaf) is ideal but often hard for home cooks to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

**Preparation:** Grate the cheese and return it to the fridge until use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Keeping the cheese cold reduces the likelihood of it overheating and releasing an orange grease layer before browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Use about 7 ounces of cheese per pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Sauce Preparation

New York-style pizza sauce is typically made from canned products and is not cooked before going on the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Recommended Canned Tomatoes:** Pastine kitchen-ready crushed tomatoes are a good grocery store alternative to commercial "Full Red" sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Additions:** Supplement with a pinch of sugar, dried oregano, and a generous amount of olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Key Principle:** Do not cook the sauce beforehand, as this can cause it to lose its essential brightness and taste more like lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## [[preparing_and_handling_pizza_dough|Preparing and Handling Pizza Dough]] for Baking

### Pizza Peel Preparation
Use a pizza peel (or a sheet of cardboard) and a granular matter like cornmeal to prevent sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Place a plate on the peel and sprinkle with flour for dough handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Dough Handling
1.  **Cold Dough:** Pull the dough ball straight from the fridge; do not warm it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The cold helps keep the wet dough workable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
2.  **Flour Coating:** Coat the dough ball in flour to prevent sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
3.  **Shaping:** Use the "gravity stretch method" by going around the edge, forming a thick cornice, and letting the rest of the dough naturally stretch out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This method is cleaner and provides more control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Shape the pizza into an oblong (oval) for wider, thinner results in a [[challenges_of_achieving_professional_pizza_crust_in_a_home_oven|home oven]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Assembly and Baking
1.  **Sauce:** Spread a thin layer of sauce, using slightly less than your instinct suggests for optimal flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
2.  **Parmesan:** Sprinkle grated parmesan cheese under the mozzarella layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
3.  **Mozzarella:** Distribute the mozzarella evenly by starting around the edge and working inward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
4.  **Transfer:** Quickly shimmy the pizza onto the preheated steel in the oven before the dough sticks to the peel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
5.  **Baking:** Bake for 6-7 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The goal is to achieve as much color as possible on the cheese without it overheating and releasing fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
6.  **Removal:** Use tongs to pull the pizza straight out onto a cooling rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Resting the pizza on a rack helps keep the crust crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Cutting and Serving

Once cooled slightly, the pizza will be solid enough to cut cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. A chef's knife is a safer and more controlled tool than a pizza cutter for home use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The baked crust should be brown with "leopard spotting" on the bottom, a characteristic achievable with a pizza steel in a [[challenges_of_achieving_professional_pizza_crust_in_a_home_oven|home oven]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

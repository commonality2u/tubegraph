## Scrambled Eggs

### American Style Scrambled Eggs
American style [[different_egg_cooking_styles_sunny_side_up_crispy_basted_over_easy_scrambled_omelette | scrambled eggs]] typically involve cracking eggs into a bowl and adding a small pinch of salt per egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. It's common to add a splash of milk or water, which loosens the mixture and allows the egg to expand and fluff up with steam in the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

For cooking, more fat and slightly higher heat are generally used, aiming for a "not so gentle foam" with the butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The goal is to create steam for a fluffy curd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The process starts by stirring constantly until the egg mixture sets up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Once set, the omelet is "destroyed" by scraping the egg off the bottom to create big, fluffy ribbons or sheets of curd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

American style [[different_egg_cooking_styles_sunny_side_up_crispy_basted_over_easy_scrambled_omelette | scrambled eggs]] are very time-sensitive, often needing to be removed from the pan moments before they reach the desired doneness, as they continue to cook from intense heat on all sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This can result in curds that are totally set with a little golden brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### French Style Scrambled Eggs
In contrast, French style [[different_egg_cooking_styles_sunny_side_up_crispy_basted_over_easy_scrambled_omelette | scrambled eggs]] are described as being "more like a stirred custard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## Omelettes

### American Style Omelettes
For an American style diner omelette, a 10-inch pan typically requires a minimum of three eggs; with two eggs, the omelet can be too thin and tear easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Similar to [[different_egg_cooking_styles_sunny_side_up_crispy_basted_over_easy_scrambled_omelette | scrambled eggs]], salt and a little milk are added, and the mixture should be beaten very smooth to loosen the protein structure, allowing the eggs to flow readily into a solid thin sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Beating with a fork is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

Lots of butter is recommended for an omelette, even in a non-stick pan, ensuring it gets up the sides where the egg will go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. An aggressive foam indicates the proper heat for an American style diner omelette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. The [[cooking_techniques_for_perfect_eggs_controlling_heat_using_butter_or_oil | cooking technique]] involves constant stirring until the mixture stops being liquid, then smashing it down into an even layer while it's still pliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Fillings, like fresh herbs or cheese, are added quickly before turning off the heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The omelette should be folded while the top is still a little gooey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The traditional tri-fold shape offers two chances to get the fold right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. American style omelettes often have a golden appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### French Style Omelettes
In contrast, a fancy French omelette is cooked at a much lower temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. These omelettes are noted for having a much smoother, softer curd and are not golden at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### General Omelette Tips
*   Always use a non-stick pan for eggs, though it is possible to cook eggs in carbon steel or stainless steel with practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   [[cooking_techniques_for_perfect_eggs_controlling_heat_using_butter_or_oil | Butter]] is preferred over oil for its flavor and for providing sensory clues about pan temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. A gentle foam indicates a good starting temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Like [[different_egg_cooking_styles_sunny_side_up_crispy_basted_over_easy_scrambled_omelette | scrambled eggs]], omelettes that cook from all sides are very time-sensitive and should be removed from the pan slightly before they are perfectly done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

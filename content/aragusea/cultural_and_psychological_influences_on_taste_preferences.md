Taste preferences are deeply influenced by cultural background, personal history, and psychological associations, leading to vastly different perceptions of the same food. A prominent example is the Hershey's chocolate bar, which, while America's favorite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, is often described by people from other parts of the world as tasting like vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This perception is not figurative, but literal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. For instance, a co-counselor from New Zealand, upon trying a Hershey Kiss at Hershey Park, exclaimed it tasted like vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Hershey's Taste Profile

The distinctive taste of Hershey's chocolate, which has been imitated by most other major chocolate brands in the U.S. due to its long dominance in the market, is what American consumers have come to expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This unique flavor profile is primarily attributed to butyric acid, or "butter acid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Milton Hershey's milk chocolate process involved cooking skim milk with sugar in a vacuum pan at low temperatures for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This low-temperature reduction process soured the milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, creating butyric acid through lipolysis (breaking down milk fat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, possibly via anaerobic fermentation in the vacuum pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

Butyric acid is also produced in our digestive systems and is responsible for the "twang" or smell associated with vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This is likely why individuals who did not grow up eating Hershey's associate its taste with sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Cultural Conditioning and Taste Perception

For those who grew up consuming Hershey's chocolate, the perception is entirely different. The consistent exposure means that butyric acid tastes like chocolate, not like vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. In contrast, British chocolates like Cadbury often strike American palates as "flat" or "dull" due to the lack of the expected acidity found in Hershey's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. British chocolates also tend to be perceived as "fatty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

A 2015 BBC focus group comparing Hershey's and Cadbury found that adult groups preferred Cadbury, describing Hershey's as harder, more bitter, and less rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. However, British children were more likely to prefer the Hershey bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This suggests that early exposure and conditioning play a significant role in developing taste preferences.

## The Subjectivity of "Good" Food

The discussion raises profound questions about defining food quality: is there such a thing as objectively good or bad food, especially for a dessert whose sole function is pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>?

Some argue that chocolate with less cocoa is objectively inferior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. However, extending this logic to unsweetened baking chocolate (pure cocoa) reveals its extreme bitterness, highlighting why other ingredients are added for palatability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Similarly, applying this to alcohol would imply pure ethanol is superior to fine Scotch or wine, which is clearly not the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

While humans are evolved to find certain tastes like butyric acid repulsive as indicators of danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, many celebrated foods globally "ride the line between enticement and revulsion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Examples include European fermented milk products like stinky cheeses, with Parmesan also containing butyric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## Psychological Connection and Pleasure

For many, including the speaker, the pleasure derived from eating Hershey's chocolate is deeply rooted in childhood memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Growing up in central Pennsylvania, near where Milton Hershey lived, visiting Hershey Park and buying a giant novelty Hershey Kiss created warm feelings that contribute to the current taste experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. These memories are "half of what I'm tasting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Ultimately, any food that brings pleasure, without harming others or one's long-term well-being, is considered "great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

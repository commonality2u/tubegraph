Indian American restaurant-style tandoori chicken is a classic takeout food that is well-suited for home preparation, being both easy and delicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It can be cooked on a grill or under a broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## [[spice_mixture_for_tandoori_chicken | Spice Mixture (Masala)]]

The foundation of tandoori chicken is its spice mixture, or *masala* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Choosing Your Masala

*   **Premade Garam Masala**: You can buy a premade garam masala mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, pre-ground masalas can taste stale over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Homemade Masala**: Toasting and grinding whole spices at home tastes better and is more convenient as whole spices last longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Key Ingredients for Color and Heat

*   **Kashmir Chili Powder**: This is a key ingredient that provides a beautiful red color without excessive heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It can often be found at Indo-Pak groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
    *   **Substitute**: If Kashmir chili powder is unavailable, a combination of cayenne pepper (for heat) and paprika (for color) can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Food Coloring**: To achieve the "candy apple red" color often seen in restaurant tandoori chicken, red food coloring can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This is a common practice in Indian American establishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Homemade Whole Spice Blend

To make a fresh masala blend:
*   **Ingredients**:
    *   1 tablespoon cumin seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
    *   1 tablespoon coriander seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
    *   A few black peppercorns (or ground black pepper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
    *   4 black cardamom pods (black ones are stronger than green) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
    *   1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
    *   Half a cinnamon stick (broken with scissors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   **Simplified Blend**: A basic, effective blend can be made with just cumin, coriander, and cardamom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Toasting**: Toast the spices on medium-high heat until they become fragrant and tiny wisps of smoke appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Traditional Indian cooks often toast spices individually for precision, but this is not necessary for home cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Grinding**: Transfer the toasted spices to a coffee grinder (dedicated for spices) and grind them until fine, dislodging larger pieces as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Preparing the Chicken

### Choosing the Cut
It's easier to use a single cut of chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Chicken legs are recommended because dark meat tastes better and is more forgiving, becoming softer and stickier when "overcooked" rather than drying out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. While a mixture of chicken parts can be used, using one cut ensures they cook at roughly the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Scoring
Score the chicken by making a few deep cuts down to the bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This helps the chicken cook faster and creates more delicious surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## [[marinating_chicken_for_tandoori | Marinating the Chicken]]

Use a stainless steel bowl for marinating, avoiding reactive materials like non-anodized aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Instead of mixing all marinade ingredients into a paste beforehand, it's often preferred to add them directly to the meat one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Marinade Ingredients and Application

1.  **Salt**: Apply salt first, eyeballing the amount to coat the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Masala**: Add the homemade masala, looking for a heavy dusting without going overboard, which could result in a powdery texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
3.  **Kashmir Chili Powder**: Eyeball the amount to achieve mild to moderate heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
4.  **Ginger Garlic Paste**: Bottled ginger garlic paste (from Indo-Pak stores) saves effort and tastes comparable in heavily cooked dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Use just a couple of spoonfuls to avoid a gross texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
5.  **Lemon Juice**: The juice of one lemon is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Too much strong acid can chemically "cook" the meat, leading to a mushy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. More lemon can be squeezed over the cooked chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
6.  **Yogurt**: Full-fat Greek yogurt is a good substitute for traditional Indian curd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. It should be thick and not too wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. About half a cup for five pounds of meat is enough; excess will just be wasted as it needs to be scraped off before cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The goal is a thick paste around the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Marinating Time
The chicken can be cooked immediately after marinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. However, letting it sit for a few hours will intensify the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Do not marinate for more than a day, as the meat can become mushy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Cooking Methods

### On a Charcoal Grill

A charcoal grill is an excellent substitute for a traditional tandoor (clay oven) because it provides intense heat and smoky flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

1.  **Start Charcoal**: Use a chimney starter with paper towels and grease (oil wick) at the bottom, then fill with natural chunk charcoal (which burns hotter than briquettes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Wait about 10 minutes until the charcoal is glowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
2.  **Prepare Grill**: Dump the hot charcoal onto the bottom grate and add a heavy layer of fresh charcoal on top to provide enough fuel for cooking the chicken through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Place the top grate and wait 5 minutes for new charcoal to ignite and heat to burn off residue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Clean the grate with a wire brush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
3.  **Grease Grill**: Grease the grill grate by pulling it off with tongs and spraying it away from the fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
4.  **Cook Chicken**: Place the chicken on the grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. There should be minimal excess marinade to drip and cause flare-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
5.  **Manage Heat**:
    *   Cover the grill immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   Keep bottom vents wide open for plenty of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    *   Keep top vents half closed for perfect airflow and heat, preventing it from getting too hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   Keeping it covered helps bake the inside of the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
6.  **Flip and Finish**: After about 5 minutes, the first side will be well-charred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Juggle pieces if heat is uneven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Flip all pieces, cover, and let them slow-cook as the coals naturally die down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Dark meat is fatty and self-basting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
7.  **Check Doneness**: After about 20 minutes (40 minutes total cooking time), check the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Scored chicken can be visibly checked for clean bone and clear juices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The deepest part of a leg should read at least 170°F (77°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
8.  **Backup Plan**: If the fire dies too quickly, the chicken can be finished in an oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Under the Broiler

This method is suitable for those without a grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

1.  **Setup**: Place chicken on a sheet pan with a rack, on the very top shelf directly under the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Set broiler to its highest heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
2.  **Broil**: Broil for about 10 minutes until well-charred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Flip and broil the second side for another 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
3.  **Bake to Finish**: Turn the broiler off and set the oven to bake at 350°F (175°C) or any moderate temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Bake on the middle rack for about 15 minutes to ensure dark meat is soft and sticky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
4.  **Manage Drippings**: If drippings are burning and causing smoke, pour a little water into the tray under the rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
5.  **Comparison**: Broiled chicken has a prettier, more even color due to better heat control, but lacks the smoky flavor of grilled chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Serving

### Preparing Vegetables
For serving, prepare whole rings of white onions and large rings of green bell pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Pan-Frying Vegetables
If the grill fire isn't hot enough for vegetables, pan-fry them:
1.  Heat a cast iron pan on the biggest burner set to high heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
2.  Add a little neutral oil when the pan is smoking hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
3.  Quickly add the vegetables with a little salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
4.  Allow them to sit for a moment to get brown edges while keeping the interior virtually raw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
5.  Toss once or twice, then remove them before they seem fully cooked, as they will soften further while sitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Plating
Plate the vegetables, then place the chicken on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Serve with a lemon wedge for squeezing fresh lemon juice over the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

This homemade tandoori chicken can taste like the real thing and is a satisfying protein and vegetable meal, without necessarily needing rice or naan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Leftovers

Making extra tandoori chicken is recommended, as it can be used later to prepare Britain's national dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

Oil is a ubiquitous ingredient in nearly every recipe, often introduced at the start by "dropping a film of oil into a pan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Its role extends beyond merely preventing food from sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:57">[01:48:57]</a>.

## Oil as a Thermal Interface

The primary function of oil in pan cooking is to act as a "thermal interface" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Pans are flat and rigid, while food surfaces are not, meaning only small parts of the food make direct contact with the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:23">[02:10:23]</a>. Oil, being a liquid fat, spreads across the pan and "reaches up" to fill the gaps between the food and the pan surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:80">[02:20:80]</a>, effectively grabbing and coating parts of the food that wouldn't otherwise touch the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:60">[02:23:60]</a>.

Oil is an excellent conductor of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This allows heat energy from the pan to be transmitted into more parts of the food, leading to more even and thorough cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## Cooking Without Oil

[[cooking_without_oil | Cooking without oil]] often yields significantly different results:

### Vegetables (Brussels Sprouts)

When Brussels sprouts are cooked with olive oil, they develop a "nice golden color" and become "very Brown and tender" in about 6 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. They are filled with starches, sugars, and proteins that brown effectively with enough time and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

In contrast, [[cooking_without_oil | cooking without oil]]:
*   While not always sticking if kept moving, the browning is localized and black, with "clearly defined borders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, as opposed to the "broad smudge of golden brown" achieved with oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   Cooking is significantly slower; sprouts that took 6 minutes with oil were still hard after 11 minutes without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   The flavor is not as good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

### Meat (Sirloin Steak)

Sirloin steak, being a lean cut, faces particular challenges when [[cooking_without_oil | cooked without oil]]:
*   It sticks "like glue" to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This is because meat is mostly water and protein, and proteins are "particularly prone to sticking," forming literal bonds with metal atoms at high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   The cooked surface shows "extreme contrast" between nearly blackened bits that touched the metal and gray bits that received little heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   There's often insufficient natural fat to act as a thermal interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   The meat cooks much slower and tastes significantly worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

Even in a non-stick pan where sticking is eliminated, [[effects_of_oil_on_nonstick_and_oven_cooking | oil is still needed]] for the thermal interface and flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Without it, steam can push the meat away from the hot surface, leading to "repulsive patches of gray" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

### Fatty Meats (Chicken Thigh)

For fattier cuts like skin-on chicken thigh, rendering fat can help cook the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. This can be done by starting in a dry, cold pan and gradually raising the heat, allowing fat to melt out before the meat begins to cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. While effective, such as with duck breast which has a large fat layer, a chicken thigh may still exhibit "a bit of that weird mixture of overdone and underdone" due to insufficient thermal interface at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

### Breads

Certain breads, such as Indian-style breads like naan, are often cooked in a dry pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. This results in "highly localized Browning or even blackening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. When oil is used, a "generalized golden Browning" occurs due to the thermal interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>, altering the flavor profile significantly (e.g., from "bread" to "a dut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>).

## Oil vs. Water as Cooking Mediums

[[oil_versus_water_as_cooking_mediums | Oil and water]] both serve as heat conducting mediums that can "wrap itself all the way around the food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Water can be used like oil to create a thin film and conduct heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

However, water has distinct disadvantages:
*   **Temperature**: Most cooking oils can reach around 400°F (200°C) before breaking down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Water, under normal atmospheric pressure, only reaches 212°F (100°C) before turning into steam and evaporating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **Browning Reactions**: Browning reactions like Maillard reaction and caramelization require temperatures around 330°F (165°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, which water cannot achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
*   **Viscosity**: Water is less viscous than fat, so it doesn't coat food as well as oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. To use water effectively as a thermal interface, food generally needs to be submerged (boiled) or enclosed in steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

## Role of Oil in Oven Cooking

When roasting vegetables and meat in an oven, the [[effects_of_oil_on_nonstick_and_oven_cooking | difference made by oil]] is less apparent on the top surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. However, the side touching the pan shows a significant difference:
*   **Oiled Side**: Achieves "beautiful golden brown" coloration where it contacts the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **Unoiled Side**: Shows "uneven coloration," a mixture of burned and pale, and can be dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

For fatty meats like beef roast, the difference in the oven might be negligible because the rendered fat naturally coats the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. Chicken skin, however, benefits from oil for a nicer appearance as the skin acts as a barrier preventing rendered fat from fully coating the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

## Other Benefits of Oil

Beyond its role as a thermal interface and anti-stick agent, fat contributes to flavor and nutrition:
*   [[Nutritional benefits of cooking food | Fats]] create "delicious flavors" through chemical interactions with other substances at high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.
*   Fat is an "essential nutrient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.
*   It facilitates the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.

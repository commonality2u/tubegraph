From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Chinese-American garlic sauce is described as a sweet, glossy, restaurant-style sauce often served in strip mall establishments, rather than being a traditional Chinese dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It's a key component in a simple, cheap, and meatless meal, which can also be made vegan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Ingredients & Preparation

The sauce starts with a base of aromatics fried in a little plain cooking oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>:
*   **Garlic:** Three to four cloves, peeled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Ginger:** A thumb-sized piece, about as much as the garlic, sliced across its fibers to make it easier to chop fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Chili:** Optional, about half a fresh chili <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   These aromatics are chopped fine and fried for about a minute until soft and starting to go golden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Next, a liquid base is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>:
*   One cup (240 ml) of water or stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Broccoli cooking water can be used, though plain water or stock works fine, as stronger flavors in the sauce minimize the stock's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Additional flavorings include:
*   Onion powder: Approximately one teaspoon, optional but nice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   Soy sauce: Start with about a quarter cup (60 ml) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   Mustard: Two teaspoons of any tangy mustard can substitute for the traditional vinegar and ground mustard seed called for in many recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   Umami agent: Traditionally, oyster sauce (made with oysters) or fish sauce provides umami and a gooey texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. A vegan alternative is a spoonful of Marmite (yeast extract), which is nutritious, contains B vitamins, and contributes umami and a glossy, gelatinous texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Sweeteners: Oyster sauce typically contains sugar, and most garlic sauce recipes call for more, such as honey or brown sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. A tablespoon of white sugar with a glug of molasses is used for a deeper flavor, without making the sauce taste like gingerbread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   Toasted sesame oil: One to two teaspoons added for flavor, but must be added at the end, not used for frying, as it burns and makes the sauce bitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   Pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Chinese five-spice: An optional dash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   MSG: A dash of Accent brand MSG can be added for umami, or plain salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Thickening the Sauce

For thickening, cornstarch or any refined starch is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
1.  About two tablespoons of starch are mixed into a slurry with just enough cool water to dissolve it, by smashing it with a finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The starch granules disperse but will sink if left to sit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
2.  Once the sauce is simmering, one hand stirs continuously while the other hand drizzles in the slurry to prevent giant starch globs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Dry cornstarch would instantly form lumps if added directly to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
3.  The sauce can become extremely thick, but can be thinned out with water later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Heat should be reduced to prevent sticking and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Seasoning and Serving

The sauce should be strong enough to flavor all accompanying ingredients, like broccoli and plain rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. It should taste "too sweet, too sour, too salty, too umami" on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Adjust acidity with more mustard or vinegar, and sweetness with more sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

After seasoning, the blanched broccoli (or other vegetables) is added to the sauce to reheat, soften slightly, and get coated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The sauce may need to be thinned with a splash of water if it becomes too thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. It's typically served over rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, optionally garnished with whole sesame seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

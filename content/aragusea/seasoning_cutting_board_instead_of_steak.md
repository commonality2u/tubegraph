From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Seasoning the cutting board, also known as "dressing the board," is a technique where flavorings are placed directly on the cutting surface rather than on the meat itself before cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This method leverages the natural process of meat reabsorbing moisture and flavor as it cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Benefits of the Method

One of the primary benefits of [[benefits_of_using_flavored_cutting_boards | dressing the board]] is that all the flavoring preparation can be done while the steak is cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, significantly reducing the total time from start to dinner to potentially 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This contrasts with traditional methods that often require seasoning meat beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Preparing the Board

Only oil is typically applied to the steak before it goes into the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While salt and pepper can be added to the steak before cooking, the idea that salting immediately before cooking enhances browning is considered a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. If salting in advance, it should be done at least 40 minutes prior to cooking, as suggested by Kenji Lopez-Alt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For more on this, see [[timing_for_salting_meat_before_cooking | Timing for salting meat before cooking]].

Various ingredients can be used to dress the board, allowing for creative flavor combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Examples include:

*   **Rosemary** Fresh rosemary is chopped finely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Garlic** A small clove of garlic is finely grated using a microplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Since it will be virtually raw, caution is advised on the amount used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. See [[uses_of_raw_ingredients_in_steak_preparation | Uses of raw ingredients in steak preparation]].
*   **Citrus** A little citrus, such as lemon, lime, or even grapefruit, can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Pepper** A generous amount of coarsely ground pepper is preferred because cooking pepper can burn it and reduce its pungency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This is why restaurants often offer fresh pepper at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Salt** Only a few grains of salt are added to the board initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The majority of the salt, preferably a super coarse finishing salt, is added at the end for "sparks of salt" rather than a uniform saltiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Butter** A couple of slivers of fresh butter are placed on the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. While it could be melted in the pan, fresh butter provides a milky taste that contrasts with the steak's dark flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, a common practice in classic American steak houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Post-Cooking Process

1.  **Resting the Steak** After cooking (e.g., a strip steak cooked for nine minutes total), the steak is rested directly on top of the prepared flavorings on the cutting board for about five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The steak's heat softens the rosemary, melts the butter, and takes the edge off the raw garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
2.  **Reclaiming Juices** As the steak rests, it releases juices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These juices, normally lost, are reclaimed by cutting the steak into thin, bite-sized slices and tossing them in the pool of flavor-augmented beef juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This allows the meat to reabsorb the flavors and juices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
3.  **Second Rest (Optional)** The meat can be rested a second time to absorb even more flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
4.  **Serving** To prevent the meat from going cold, it can be eaten straight off the board or served on a warmed plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Plates can be warmed by running them under hot water for a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. A hot plate can even reheat a well-rested piece of meat, which is why steak houses often heat their plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

After the process, very little juice should be left on the board, indicating the meat has absorbed the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Even without added flavorings, tossing the meat in its own juices is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

This method is suitable for any tender cut of meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## General Approach to Macaron Variations

Macarons are often considered "fussy" and "notoriously fussy" to make, especially when aiming for perfectly smooth domes and ruffled edges known as macaron feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, if one liberates themselves from "precious expectations" about how they "are supposed to look," macarons can be one of the easiest and cheapest desserts to make at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that meringue cookies, which form the macaron shells, "may be the most forgiving pastry on earth" if appearance is not the sole focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Part of the enjoyment of home cooking is the variety that comes from a handcrafted product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This flexibility allows for radical alteration of ingredient proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Macaron Shell Variations

When not striving for cosmetic perfection, various changes to the ingredients can yield different, but equally delicious, results:

*   **Sugar Content**
    *   Using *more sugar* than typical recipes results in a "cotton candy ish melt-in-your-mouth texture" for the meringue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   Using *less sugar* can lead to a "chewy brownie consistency" for the meringue shells, which are also less sweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
    *   Different amounts of sugar have been experimented with, and every batch came out different but good, maintaining basic structural integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

*   **Almond Flour Content**
    *   Using *more almond flour* can make the meringue taste "more cookie ish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    *   Using *less almond flour* can make the meringue taste "more candy ish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   Similar to sugar, experiments with varying almond amounts resulted in different but good batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

*   **Cocoa Powder (for Chocolate Macarons)**
    *   About a quarter cup of natural cocoa powder makes the shells "pretty chocolatey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
    *   For more of an "Oreo flavor," Dutch cocoa can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   Not sifting cocoa powder may leave small chunks in the finished macarons, which is not necessarily a "bad thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

*   **Texture and Appearance (Intentional Imperfection)**
    *   Allowing meringues to crack during baking can serve as a "great indication of when they're done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Cracked or irregular edges become crispier and more caramelized, making them tastier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
    *   A thicker batter, resulting from less mixing during the "macaron --oj" phase, yields "craggy tops" that some prefer over smooth domes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
    *   Large air pockets within the macaron shells are appreciated by the speaker, despite others working to prevent them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. These air pockets allow the layers to collapse as one bites through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Macaron Fillings

Macarons typically consist of two [[Almond Flour and Meringue Ingredients | almond meringue]] cookies sandwiching "some kind of filling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

*   **Simple Ganache**
    *   A simple ganache can be made with equal parts cream and chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
    *   Dark chocolate is preferred to balance the sweetness of the meringue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   Sugar can be added to the ganache if desired, but a more bitter chocolate without added sugar is recommended to offset the sweet cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   **Preparation:** Microwave the cream and chocolate until the cream just starts to bubble, then remove and let sit to melt before stirring until smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
    *   The ganache must be cooled to achieve the right consistency for filling, either by waiting an hour at room temperature or by refrigerating it and stirring frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   **Filling Technique:** Spread a little filling on one meringue and marry it with another of roughly comparable size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Due to the insubstantial nature of the meringue, care should be taken not to overfill; the amount of ganache should "feel like not quite enough" to avoid overwhelming the meringues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

*   **Marshmallow Fluff**
    *   For macaron shells made with less sugar (which have a "chewy brownie consistency"), marshmallow fluff makes a complementary filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Post-Assembly Enhancement

Macarons can be eaten immediately after filling, but they are "ten times better the next day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This waiting period allows the meringues to absorb moisture from the filling and the air, resulting in a more "chewy marshmallowy consistency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

In the context of lunch fillings, "salad" typically refers to a chopped, cold protein bound in a creamy base, usually mayonnaise, and flavored with other ingredients, often eaten as a sandwich filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explores creative ways to prepare and customize these types of salads, including [[tuna_salad_preparation_and_variations | tuna salad]], [[egg_salad_tips_and_techniques | egg salad]], and chicken salad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## [[tuna_salad_preparation_and_variations | Tuna Salad]]

### Basic Preparation

For [[tuna_salad_preparation_and_variations | tuna salad]], canned tuna (in a can or pouch) is typically used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. If using a can, it's important to drain it thoroughly, as cans contain more water or oil for sealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The vacuum pouch usually contains very little water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Canned tuna is preferred over fresh tuna for this dish, as the sandwich evolved to make the cheaper canned product palatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Mayonnaise works well as a binder because fish is lean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Start with a few scoops and add more later to achieve the desired consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Key Flavor and Texture Add-ins

*   **Shallots**: A great choice for onion due to their mild flavor, allowing for a generous amount and larger pieces for crunch without overwhelming the taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Dried onion flakes or powder can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Sweet Pickle Relish**: A highly recommended secret ingredient, especially in the South, that significantly enhances the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Pepper and Garlic Powder**: Essential for seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Celery**: Adds a crucial crunch to contrast with the soft fish and creamy dressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Thin slices across the whole stalk are suggested for maximum crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The celery leaves can also be added for flavor and color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Salt**: Add sparingly, as tuna is often already salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Serving Suggestions
[[tuna_salad_preparation_and_variations | Tuna salad]] is excellent served on a sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It's a great option to prepare in advance for lunches over several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## [[egg_salad_tips_and_techniques | Egg Salad]]

### Hard-Boiling Eggs

To prepare [[egg_salad_tips_and_techniques | egg salad]], hard-boil a dozen eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Boiling Method**: Dropping eggs into already boiling water can help the white pull away from the shell for easier peeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Cook Time**: 14 minutes is considered an ideal time for hard-boiled eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Cooling**: Instead of an ice bath, draining hot water and spraying the eggs with cool tap water in the pot is an easier and effective cooling method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Peeling Eggs

A simple method for peeling hard-boiled eggs involves:
1.  Smacking the egg all over with the back of a spoon, focusing on the bottom where there's often a hollow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
2.  Using the edge of the spoon to push under the shell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
3.  Rinsing each peeled egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Since the eggs will be chopped for [[egg_salad_tips_and_techniques | egg salad]], minor imperfections from peeling are not an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Mixing and Flavoring

*   **Yolk Base**: Slice the eggs in half and push the cooked yolks into a bowl to smash them smooth with mayonnaise and other flavorings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. You may need almost equal parts mayo and egg yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Southern Influence**: Incorporate a generous amount of sweet pickle relish, which is a common addition in Southern [[egg_salad_tips_and_techniques | deviled eggs]] and enhances flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Mustard**: A "sinus-clearing quantity" of mustard adds a tangy kick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Seasoning**: Add salt and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The flavoring mixture should taste strong enough on its own to adequately flavor the bland egg whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Combining**: Dice the egg whites and dump them into the yellow yolk mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Adding Crunch and Freshness

To prevent [[egg_salad_tips_and_techniques | egg salad]] from being too mushy, incorporate crunchy elements:
*   **Fresh Onion/Shallot**: Coarsely chopped shallot adds a mild flavor and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The onion flavor will mellow as it sits in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Cucumber**: A mild taste that won't overpower the egg, providing tons of fresh, watery crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Leaving some peel on adds color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Triangular thin slices are suggested for good texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Note that cucumber can release water overnight, so adjust moisture levels accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### Serving Suggestions
[[egg_salad_tips_and_techniques | Egg salad]] is made easier to eat on little rolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Lightly toasting the bread adds a contrasting texture without being too rigid, which could squish the salad out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Chicken Salad

### Protein Base

Grocery store rotisserie chicken is an ideal base for chicken salad due to its low cost, good flavor, and soft texture, which allows for easy shredding into chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. When picking meat, start with chunks that feel slightly too big, as they will break apart and shred during mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The dryness of white meat is not an issue since it will be coated in a creamy binder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Creative Creamy Binders

While mayonnaise is common, an alternative creamy binder can be made from whipping cream:
1.  Heat about two cups (a pint or 400-500ml) of whipping cream to a bare simmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
2.  Juice in a whole lemon (or at least half a lemon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The acid will instantly coagulate and thicken the cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
3.  Let it cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

This "thickened acidified cream" offers a lighter alternative to mayonnaise (closer to 60% fat compared to mayo's 95% fat) and provides a fresh taste from the lemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. It will stiffen in the fridge, so allowing it to warm slightly before serving is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Innovative Add-ins for Flavor and Texture

*   **Green Onions**: A great alternative to shallots, offering a mild flavor and crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Use thin slices from the firm white end and progressively larger pieces from the green tops for varied texture and color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Sweet Corn**: Shaved off the cob, it provides a hit of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Fruit (Grapes, Apple)**: Fruits like grapes (quartered) or apples add acidity and sweetness, brightening the salad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Nuts (Pistachios)**: For additional crunch, any kind of nuts can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Pistachios, once shelled, should be smashed or lightly chopped to maintain texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Seasoning**: Add pepper and a little salt, remembering rotisserie chickens are often already salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Herbs**: Parsley adds a nice touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Garlic powder is also a recommended addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## General Tips for Creative Salads

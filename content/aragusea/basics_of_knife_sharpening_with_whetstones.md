This article provides a primer on [[proper_technique_and_angles_for_sharpening_knives | sharpening kitchen knives with stones]], also known as whetstones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The term "whet" (with an 'h') is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning "to sharpen" or "to get something ready" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## Why Use Whetstones?

While multi-stage [[differences_between_pullthrough_sharpeners and whetstones | pull-through sharpeners]] can be effective for basic use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>, professional chefs generally prefer sharpening with stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. Even sharpening 40 to 60 knives a week can be physically demanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>.

The main advantages of whetstones include:
*   **Temperature Control** Unlike mechanical grinders or pull-through sharpeners which can rip or grind metal and heat the blade, a stone remains cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>. This prevents "detempering" the blade, which can make it prematurely dull or prevent it from getting sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Finer Edge** Whetstones result in a finer, cleaner edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
*   **Material Preservation** They remove less steel compared to mechanical methods, which is crucial for preserving the life of expensive knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Total Control** Stones offer complete control over the cutting angle, allowing for a very narrow, sharp edge or a wider, tougher edge (like an axe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. They can be used for both standard western double-beveled knives and single-beveled Asian-style knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Basic Theory of Knife Sharpening

The cross-section of a blade is known as its geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. The goal of sharpening is to make the two planes of the blade converge to a point of zero thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. As metal is ground away, a tiny piece of metal, called a **burr**, will form and shoot past the edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

### Feeling for the Burr
The burr is often too small to see, even under a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. It can be safely felt by pulling your thumb across the blade *perpendicular* to the edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. The burr feels like a tiny fingernail on the edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### Creating and Removing the Burr
The entire point of sharpening is to create a consistent, even burr along the entire length of the blade, and then to remove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
1.  **Initial Edge**: A coarsely textured stone is used to grind out the new edge and create the burr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
2.  **Finishing**: A more finely textured stone is then used to polish off the burr and align the micro-serrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

## [[types_of_whetstones_and_selecting_the_right_grit | Types of Whetstones and Selecting the Right Grit]]

The "profile" of a blade refers to the serrations or "teeth" on its edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. These teeth are determined by the grit of the stone used for sharpening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   **Grit Number**: The number on a stone indicates particle size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. Confusingly, a *bigger* number means *smaller* particle size, as it refers to the spatial density of particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **Coarser Stone (Smaller Grit Number)**: Has bigger micro-particles that cut bigger, wider teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. For beginners, it's recommended to start with a medium grit stone (e.g., 1200 grit) to avoid removing too much material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. This stone is for the initial phase of cutting the new edge and creating the burr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
*   **Finer Stone (Larger Grit Number)**: Has smaller particles that take smaller chunks out of the blade, polishing the burr and refining the teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. A very sharp knife with fine teeth can shave arm hair and dice onions without causing tears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

### Knife Steel Hardness and Grit Selection
The appropriate grit for finishing depends on the knife's steel hardness, often measured on the Rockwell hardness scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
*   **German/European Knives**: Typically range from 52 to 58 Rockwell hardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. For these, finishing in the 2,000 to 4,000 grit range is generally sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. Finer grits won't improve the edge and may make it feel duller due to the steel's softness and chromium content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.
*   **Japanese/Asian Knives**: Often reach into the 60s on the Rockwell scale, harder than window glass (around 60 Rockwell) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. Harder steel holds a finer, narrower edge with very tiny, spiky teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. However, very hard steel is less flexible, more brittle, and harder to sharpen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. A coarser finishing stone would knock off such a fine edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. For these, a finer finishing stone (6,000-8,000 grit) is needed, ideal for sushi chefs seeking a glossy, smooth finish for raw fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Knives**: Many low to mid-market knives combine elements of Japanese smithing tailored for the German and French market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. These are often considered ideal all-purpose home kitchen knives, holding a 15 or 17-degree cutting edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. Their steel hardness is between European and Japanese steel, making them harder than normal German steel but not so hard as to be brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. A 4,000 to 6,000 grit finishing stone is recommended for these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

Advanced sharpeners might choose specific grits to achieve different "teeth" for cutting various items (e.g., coarser for tough tomato skins, finer for delicate raw fish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

### Minimal Gear for Starting Out
Unlike some tasks, knife sharpening with stones requires at least two or three items:
1.  **Coarse Stone**: For the initial grind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.
2.  **Fine Stone**: For finishing and polishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Combo Stones**: These have one grit on one side and a different grit on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. However, sharpening removes material from the stone, leading to unevenness over time that can affect sharpening angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.
3.  **Flattening Stone (Lapping Plate/Leveling Plate)**: Essential for re-leveling your sharpening stones, which become uneven with use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. A diamond plate is a common type of flattening tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>; it just needs to be bigger and harder than your sharpening stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

It's recommended to buy the largest and thickest stones possible, as surface area and mass are important, and the height of the stone dictates its lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>.

### Preparation
1.  **Wet the Whetstone**: All whetstones (with an 'h') need to be wet (without an 'h') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[00:13:45]</a>.
    *   **Soaking Stones**: Must be soaked in water in advance until air bubbles stop releasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[00:13:59]</a>. Pros sometimes keep them permanently soaked, changing the water to prevent mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[00:14:21]</a>. Soaking stones offer more tactile feedback for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[00:14:11]</a>.
    *   **Splash-and-Go Stones**: Only need to be wet as you use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[00:13:52]</a>. They are generally more expensive and harder, providing less tactile feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[00:14:03]</a>.
2.  **Set up the Station**: Place a damp towel on the counter to hold the stone steady and provide a surface to wipe the knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[00:14:41]</a>. Using a loaf pan or sink bridge can raise the stone to prevent knuckles from hitting the counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[00:14:49]</a>. Keep a bowl of water handy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
3.  **Flatten the Stone**: Use the diamond plate to flatten the coarse stone, applying even pressure in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[00:15:06]</a>. This also brings up "mud," which acts as a lubricant for the knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[00:15:43]</a>. Round off the stone's corners to prevent chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Holding the Knife
Use a three-point grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[00:15:51]</a>:
*   Dominant hand on the handle.
*   Thumb on the heel of the knife.
*   Finger out on the spine.
*   The blade faces you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[00:16:02]</a>.
*   The arm from the elbow up should remain fixed, with most motion coming from the shoulder to the elbow to maintain angle control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   The non-dominant hand provides pressure with two or three fingers, always staying over the stone for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[00:16:22]</a>.

### Sharpening Motion
*   **Strokes**: Push back and forth, pushing harder on the outward stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   **Drawing the Knife**: Gradually draw the knife perpendicularly across the stone to sharpen the entire length of the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   **Tip Sharpening**: As you get toward the tip, rotate the knife slightly by lifting your elbow (not twisting your wrist) to follow its natural curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[00:16:54]</a>.

### Angles
*   **Blade Face to Stone**: Position the face of the blade at a 15 to 20-degree angle from the stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. Beginners can go freehand and "feel" for the natural angle that produces a shaving feeling, which generally reproduces the knife's previous bevel angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>.
*   **Blade Length to Stone**: For the first side, position the blade at about 45 degrees relative to the stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:57:00">[17:57:00]</a>. For the second side, rotate the knife so the blade is perpendicular to the stone (90 degrees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. This creates more beneficial teeth for cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.

### Process Steps
1.  **First Side (Coarse Stone)**: Sharpen one side until a consistent burr is raised along the entire length of the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.
2.  **Clean and Rewet**: Wipe the knife and re-wet the stone as needed; if it gets too dry, the knife won't move smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. Rewetting also removes "swarf" (abraded steel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>.
3.  **Second Side (Coarse Stone)**: Rotate the knife in your hand so the blade points away from you, maintaining the three-point grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. Sharpen the second side until the burr flips to the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>.
4.  **Reduce Burr**: Repeat the process a couple more times with progressively fewer passes and lighter pressure to reduce the burr's width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>. Always keep both sides symmetrical for double-beveled knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>.
5.  **Switch to Fine Stone**: Flatten the fine grit stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>. Repeat the sharpening process with less pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. The goal is to feel for the *absence* of a burr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>.
6.  **Stropping**: This is the final step once the burr is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>. It's a one-way motion, pushing or pulling opposite the direction of the edge, away from the cutting part of the knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. Stropping hones the blade, aligning the micro-teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. A honing steel serves a similar purpose between sharpenings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>.
7.  **Test**: Clean the knife and test its sharpness. A sharp knife will cut cleanly without tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>.

Different motions exist, including circular motions, but the described method is a traditional Japanese one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>.

## [[maintenance_and_care_for_sharpening_stones_and_knives | Maintenance and Care]]
Regularly flattening your stones is crucial for maintaining proper sharpening angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. A diamond plate can also be used to fix major structural flaws in knives, such as chips or dull points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. For convenience, a sink bridge can hold the stone over the sink, allowing for easy wetting and containment of mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:00">[23:14:00]</a>.

While pull-through sharpeners are convenient, sharpening with stones yields a much finer, more polished edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:34:00">[22:34:00]</a>.

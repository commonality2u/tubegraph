## Basic Tuna Salad Preparation

### Tuna Selection and Preparation
Tuna salad typically uses canned tuna or tuna from a vacuum pouch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. If using canned tuna, it's essential to drain it thoroughly, as cans contain more water or oil for sealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. A common method is to squeeze the lid into the can to wring out the liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Vacuum pouches contain very little water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Using fresh tuna is not recommended, as tuna salad evolved as a way to make inexpensive canned tuna palatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

### Creamy Binder: Mayonnaise
Mayonnaise works well because tuna fish is very lean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Start by eyeballing a few scoops and then add more later if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. The quantity of mayonnaise can be adjusted to personal preference, though many people prefer a higher moisture content than a drier salad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

### Aromatic and Crunchy Additions
*   **Shallots:** Shallots are preferred for onion because they are mild, allowing for a generous amount of onion and relatively large pieces to provide crunch without an overpowering onion taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Some people may have used dried onion flakes or powder in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Sweet Pickle Relish:** This ingredient is highly recommended for tuna salad, significantly enhancing its flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Celery:** Celery adds a desirable crunch that contrasts with the soft fish and creamy dressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Thin slices across the whole stock are preferred over dicing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The leaves from the celery stalk can also be added for flavor and visual appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### Seasoning
*   **Pepper:** Grind in a generous amount of pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **Garlic Powder:** Garlic powder is a suggested seasoning for this dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **Salt:** Add salt cautiously, as canned tuna is often already quite salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Taste and adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Serving Suggestions
Tuna salad is typically eaten as a sandwich filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Lettuce is a nice addition to the sandwich, and tomatoes are also quite good with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Storage
Tuna salad is a great dish to prepare in advance and can be eaten for lunch over several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

Pre-shredded mozzarella cheese is a widely available and tempting option for pizza makers due to its convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. However, it presents specific challenges when used on pizza compared to block mozzarella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## The Anti-Caking Agent Problem

The primary issue with pre-shredded mozzarella is that it contains an anti-caking blend, often including ingredients like corn starch, potato starch, and calcium sulfate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. These agents are added to prevent the shredded cheese from clumping together into a solid ball when stored in a bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Interference with Melting and Browning
The anti-caking agents can negatively impact the cheese's performance during baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>:
*   **Non-melting components**: The anti-caking materials themselves may not melt at typical pizza baking temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Battering effect**: If too much anti-caking agent is present, it can create a "battered" or "breaded" layer on the shreds, preventing the outer cheese from melting properly even if the inside does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Moisture Absorption and Drying
Another significant challenge is that anti-caking agents can absorb moisture released from the cheese during baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This absorption can lead to the cheese surface becoming too dry, resulting in a toasted or even burned appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. For example, a pizza made with pre-shredded cheese may end up with burned cheese by the time it's done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Quality Control Considerations
Despite these challenges, it is possible to make a good pizza with pre-shredded cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The issues often stem from quality control during manufacturing, as some producers may add excessive amounts of the anti-caking mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. If one brand of pre-shredded cheese does not perform well, it is recommended to try another, as different brands are made in slightly different ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

Small differences in ingredient quality can significantly impact the final pizza product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

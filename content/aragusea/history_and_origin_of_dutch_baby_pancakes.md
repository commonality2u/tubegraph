From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

A Dutch baby is a type of popover, similar to a [[variations_and_tips_for_cooking_pancakes | Yorkshire pudding]], but baked in a wide pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. In the U.S., a popover baked in a wide pan is specifically referred to as a "Dutch baby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

The [[dutch_baby_batter_preparation_techniques | batter]] for a Dutch baby is a very wet, unleavened [[variations_and_tips_for_cooking_pancakes | pancake]] batter that steams significantly in the oven, causing it to puff over the rim of the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Both [[traditional_sweet_dutch_baby_recipe | traditional sweet]] and [[savory_dutch_baby_preparation_and_toppings | savory]] versions exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Origin of the Name

The origin of the name "Dutch baby" is disputed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is suggested that "Dutch" in this context is likely an anglicization of the German word "Deutsche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Therefore, it is implied that the Germans are the ones who should be "offended" by the name, indicating a potential German origin for the dish or its concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

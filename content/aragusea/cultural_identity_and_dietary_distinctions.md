Pork is considered a polarizing meat, potentially the most polarizing food globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While it accounts for over a third of global meat consumption, about a third of humanity studiously avoids eating pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This avoidance is often due to the belief that pork is inherently unclean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Historical Origins of the Pork Taboo

Anthropologists, archaeologists, and theologians have long debated the [[Historical and cultural origins of the pork taboo | historical origins of the pork taboo]], with no clear scholarly consensus on its historical source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

The earliest codification of the [[Historical and cultural origins of the pork taboo | pork taboo]] in Abrahamic religious law appears in the Torah, specifically Leviticus and Deuteronomy, written in the first millennium BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Ancient Jewish law states pork is forbidden because pigs have a cloven hoof but do not chew their cud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Cloven-hoofed animals like cows, goats, and sheep, which also chew their cud, were permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Ruminants (cud-chewers) can digest cellulose, the main structural bulk of most plants, unlike humans or pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Pigs and humans have very similar digestive systems and eat similar foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The Torah does not explain *why* these characteristics make pork bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The Qur'an also forbids the flesh of swine, along with carrion and blood, unless one is starving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Carrion (rotten meat from animals that died on their own) and blood are particularly likely to harbor dangerous pathogens, leading some to assume the prohibition against pork was an ancient health and safety code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This theory gained traction in the 19th century when scientists linked trichinosis to undercooked pork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This scientific understanding seemed to provide logic to the Old Testament, which was attractive to intellectuals at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

However, recent scholarship casts doubt on the trichinosis theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. American anthropologist Marvin Harris argued in the 1980s that pork is not exceptionally hazardous as a source of disease; all domestic animals can pose health risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. There is no evidence that trichinosis was widespread in the ancient Middle East or that ancient Middle Easterners even knew of its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Furthermore, meat parasites typically cause mild or asymptomatic illnesses, making it difficult for ancient people to link them to specific meats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Harris suggests this theory is a case of modern people projecting their own experiences onto ancient societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Maimonides' View: Unclean Habits and Economic Inefficiency

One of the earliest specific arguments for the [[Historical and cultural origins of the pork taboo | pork taboo]] comes from Maimonides, a 12th-century philosopher and physician to Saladin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Maimonides wrote that the main reason pork is forbidden is due to pigs' "very dirty and loathsome" habits and foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. He argued that allowing pork consumption would make streets and houses dirtier, citing the "country of the Franks" (Crusaders) as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Pigs are indeed conspicuously gross compared to most farm animals; they eat anything including trash, roadkill, and even human excrement, and they wallow in mud, potentially their own waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. However, pigs only resort to such filth when humans leave them no other option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Marvin Harris's theory suggests that in the ancient Middle East, which had more trees, pigs in forests rooted for seeds, nuts, and truffles and used shade to cool themselves, making them less "gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Pigs lack sweat glands and have small lungs, so they need mud or shade to shed heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Harris postulates that Iron Age population growth in the Middle East led to deforestation and desertification, forcing pigs to wallow to stay cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Urbanization further concentrated humans and their waste (food scraps, human excrement), attracting pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. In this new context, pigs appeared unflattering and potentially competed with humans for food, as they cannot eat grass like ruminants and prefer grains and similar foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. In contrast, in less arid regions like ancient Rome, pigs could clean streets of waste and convert it into protein without competing for food, a synergy also seen in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Harris argues that in the arid Middle East, pigs became both "gross and uneconomical," leading to the religious prohibitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Counterarguments

Critics of Harris's theory point out that goats, which also eat "anything" including poop, and chickens, whose coops are often dirty, are not forbidden to Jews and Muslims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Chickens also eat grains, competing with humans for food, though perhaps less than pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Richard Redding, an archaeologist, argued in a 2015 paper that chickens may have supplanted pork in the Middle Eastern diet because they convert food scraps into protein more efficiently than pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Chickens also produce eggs and are smaller, allowing for single-meal consumption in hot climates where meat spoils quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Redding suggests chickens were simply better suited to the Middle East environment and replaced pigs when they arrived later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. However, this raises the question of why a religious prohibition would be necessary if people would naturally favor a more efficient animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Dietary Distinctions as Cultural Identity

Recent archaeology indicates that pig eating never completely ceased in the Middle East and was not limited to non-Israelites like the Philistines; some ancient Jews in the region also ate pork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This suggests that laws against pork were made *because* people were engaging in the practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

Once the [[Historical and cultural origins of the pork taboo | pork taboo]] took hold, it became a means for groups to distinguish themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. For instance, the law in the Torah might have served as a mechanism to assimilate northern Jews, who likely still ate pork, into the southern culture that eschewed it around the 7th century BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Over time, the [[Historical and cultural origins of the pork taboo | pork taboo]] became a way for Israelites to differentiate themselves from Romans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Later, Muslims adopted the Abrahamic tradition to distinguish themselves from groups like the "dirty crusading Franks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

While the exact origins of the [[Historical and cultural origins of the pork taboo | pork taboo]] remain uncertain, its spread and persistence can be understood through its role as a marker of [[Cultural and psychological influences on taste preferences | cultural identity]] and distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

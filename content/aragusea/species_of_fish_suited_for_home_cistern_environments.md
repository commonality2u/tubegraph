Individuals interested in [[raising_fish_in_home_cisterns | raising fish in home cisterns]] for entertainment or consumption may find inspiration from Nick Tobler, who transformed his grandfather's concrete cistern into a large aquatic habitat known as "the eel pit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Cisterns, which are among the oldest human technologies for collecting rainwater, offer a unique environment for aquaculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Advantages of Cistern Environments for Fish

Cisterns, especially those underground, provide several benefits for [[setting_up_aquaculture_systems_in_residential_settings | setting up aquaculture systems in residential settings]]:
*   **Stable Temperature** The water in a basement cistern remains remarkably stable in temperature, typically between 40 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit year-round, because the earth acts as a great insulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. This contrasts with outdoor fish farms where water temperatures can fluctuate greatly, limiting fish options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   **Clean Water Source** When fed by rainwater, cistern water can be exceptionally clean and pure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This is a significant advantage for maintaining water quality, which is the biggest challenge in any aquaculture system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

## Suitable Fish Species

Several species thrive in the cool, clean, and oxygen-rich environments that well-managed cisterns can provide:

### Sturgeon
Nick Tobler's "eel pit" notably houses Diamond sturgeon and Albino sterlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Sturgeon are known for their high water quality requirements, needing cool, very clean water akin to a mountain stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Needs** Sturgeon have very high oxygen demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. They are adapted to oxygen-rich mountain streams and must swim constantly to breathe in still water, similar to sharks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   **Compatibility** Due to their size and constant movement, sturgeon can get caught and drown in aquatic plants, making plants unsuitable for a sturgeon-filled cistern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

### Trout
Trout are considered an excellent choice for a cistern setup intended for food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. They are delicious and productive freshwater fish that prefer cold water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. Many commonly consumed fish species are cold-water varieties, as fish evolve to grow larger in colder environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

### Catfish
Catfish, which hide in cinder blocks in Nick's cistern, could also be considered for eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

### Other Species in the "Eel Pit"
Nick's collection also includes freshwater American eels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> and Gar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. While these are kept as pets, they demonstrate the diversity of species that can adapt to a large, well-maintained cistern environment. The Gar are noted for their prehistoric appearance, resembling "dinosaurs with fins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

## Maintaining Water Quality for Fish
Keeping a dense mass of fish requires diligent [[water_purification_and_oxygenation_methods_in_fish_tanks | water purification and oxygenation methods in fish tanks]] to prevent ammonia poisoning from fish waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Nick's system involves:
*   **Water Changes** Pumping out dirty water and allowing clean rainwater to flow back in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>, supplemented by a garden hose when rain is scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
*   **Filtration** Water is pumped through a filter drum containing bioballs, which provide surface area for beneficial bacteria to grow. These bacteria convert ammonia into nitrates, helping to filter the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.
*   **Oxygenation** Intentional splashing of water and multiple airstones are used to oxygenate the water, which is crucial for species like sturgeon with high oxygen needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
*   **Substrate Choice** A river rock substrate is used instead of sand to prevent gas pockets from building up in the enclosed environment, ensuring ample gas exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

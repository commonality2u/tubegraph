From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

This recipe is designed to create oven fries that are as crunchy as if they were deep-fried, while being easy and clean to make at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While not quick, the process is mostly unattended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Ingredients
*   Large russet potatoes (one per person) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   Olive oil (or a neutral oil like peanut oil for a more traditional fry flavor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>
*   Coarse salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>
*   Garlic powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>
*   Pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
*   Chopped cilantro (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>
*   Parmesan cheese (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>

## Equipment
*   Large saucepan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Large roasting tray or baking sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   Large bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
*   Towel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>

## Preparation Method

### 1. Preparing the Potatoes
*   **Peeling (Optional):** Peel the potatoes to maximize the starchy surface area for crispiness, though it's not strictly necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Cutting:** Cut potatoes into your desired fry shape. Aim for roughly equal thickness to ensure even cooking, even if shapes vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The fries will shrink by about half during cooking, so cut them on the thicker side (like steak fries) to prevent them from breaking apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For ease and sturdiness, consider cutting them into wedges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### 2. Boiling the Potatoes
*   Place the cut potatoes into a large saucepan and add just enough water to cover them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   Bring to a boil over high heat, using a lid to speed up the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Boiling makes the interior fluffy and creates a fluffy, starchy exterior that becomes incredibly crispy when roasted in fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Boil until the potatoes are "terrified they're gonna fall apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For long, thin shapes, this is particularly risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The suggested time is about eight minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Draining:** To drain, open a small gap between the pot and the lid and let the water fall out, keeping the delicate fries intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### 3. Oiling and Roasting
*   Gently dump the boiled potatoes into a large roasting tray, spreading them out into a single layer as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Some breakage is fine and will result in extra crispy bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   Pour a generous amount of oil directly onto the potatoes, ensuring they are very well coated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Gently shake the tray to coat the pieces in oil and arrange them in one layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The "fluffy, beat-up surface" on the fries is crucial for crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   Roast in a 450°F (232°C) oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   After about 45 minutes, flip the larger pieces and check for sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Add more oil if they look dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   Give them another shake; they will be more rigid now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   Return to the oven for another 45 minutes, or until desired crispiness is reached. Total cooking time can vary based on your oven and potato cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   Be conservative with cooking time; over-browning can lead to a slightly burned taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Fries will firm up considerably as they cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Finishing and Seasoning

Once cooked, use Anthony Bourdain's draining method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>:
1.  Place a towel in a large bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
2.  Dump the hot fries into the bowl; the towel will absorb excess oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
3.  Remove the towel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
4.  Add a generous amount of coarse salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
5.  Optionally, add garlic powder, pepper, chopped cilantro, and grated Parmesan cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
6.  Toss to coat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

The fries will have a glassy, British roast potato exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. For more on this, see [[seasoning_and_serving_oven_fries | Seasoning and serving oven fries]].

## Tips and Benefits

### Achieving Crispiness
*   The secret to highly crispy oven fries comes from boiling them first, a technique used by "the Brits" for their roast potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This process creates a fluffy, starchy exterior that crisps up when roasted in fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This is one of the key [[cooking_techniques_for_crispy_fries | cooking techniques for crispy fries]].
*   As Jamie Oliver once stated, "the secret is to boil them as long as you dare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Benefits Over Deep-Fried Fries
*   This recipe allows you to cook a large batch (enough for four people) all at once, unlike conventional deep-fried fries which require small batches unless you have a commercial fryer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For more, see [[benefits_of_oven_fries_over_deepfried_fries | Benefits of oven fries over deep-fried fries]].
*   There's no giant pot of hot oil to clean up, and no lingering smell of frying oil in the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Oven fries stay hot and crunchy for a surprisingly long time, offering a good 20-minute window to finish preparing the rest of your meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

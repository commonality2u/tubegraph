Achieving perfectly cooked eggs involves mastering various [[cooking techniques | cooking techniques]], from choosing the right equipment to understanding heat dynamics and fat application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This guide covers approaches for various [[different_egg_cooking_styles_sunny_side_up_crispy_basted_over_easy_scrambled_omelette | egg styles]] like sunny side up, crispy, basted, over easy, scrambled, and omelets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Choosing Your Pan and Fat

The primary reason to keep a [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | non-stick pan]] is specifically for eggs, as cooking fried eggs in other types of pans is significantly harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While a good [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | non-stick pan]] *could* allow for cooking with no fat, most people use some fat to enhance the egg's taste and prevent sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

[[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | Butter]] is often preferred over [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | oil]] for its taste and its ability to provide sensory clues about the pan's temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Butter as a Temperature Indicator

*   **Not Hot Enough**: If [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] merely melts smoothly, the [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | pan]] is likely not hot enough, unless you're aiming for a very soft, pure white egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Ideal Starting Temperature**: A gentle foam from the [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] indicates a great starting temperature for most eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. On one stove, this is just below medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Too Hot/Browning**: If the [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] browns, the [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | pan]] is quite hot, which is suitable for some egg preparations but not others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Eggs can be cooked straight from the refrigerator or at room temperature; it doesn't significantly impact the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## General Egg Cracking Tips

*   Crack eggs on a flat surface to minimize the risk of sending shell shards into the yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   Cracking on the side of a bowl can create small, hard-to-remove shards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Hit the egg hard enough to break it cleanly, avoiding the need to dig in with thumbs, which can break the yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Cooking Different Egg Styles

### Sunny Side Up Eggs

*   **For Even Cooking**: Start with [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] at a nice gentle foam, crack the egg, and then cover the [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | pan]] with a tight-fitting lid (or foil) to trap steam, cooking the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The yolk will become cloudy after a few minutes, indicating it's warm but still soft and runny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **For Soft, Creamy White**: Use very low heat, so the [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] hardly foams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The bottom white will set without fluttering or bubbling, and covering with a lid will steam the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This method takes longer (around 8 minutes) but yields a soft, custardy white that is easily cut with a fork, and a warm, runny yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **For a Crispy Egg**: [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | Oil]] is better than [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] for this, as milk solids in [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] would burn at the required high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Use medium to high heat; you want to see the skirt of white fluttering with lots of steam and bubbles, indicating hot [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | oil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The heat will reach up to the yolk, making it cloudy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The bottom will be firm and crispy, like a potato chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Basted Eggs

This method provides more control and results in a bright, solid yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

*   Use a little more [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | oil]] (extra virgin olive [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | oil]] or even chicken fat) than usual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   Cook the egg to your desired aggression for the bottom white (e.g., no fluttering for a soft white bottom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   Instead of covering, spoon hot [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | oil]] from the [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | pan]] over the top of the egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Tilting the [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | pan]] can help pool the [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | oil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   This allows precise cooking of specific areas and prevents the cloudy yolk seen with steaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Over Easy Eggs

This is often considered a superior way to cook an unbroken egg in a [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | pan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

*   Start with gently foaming [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   Cook the white until it's pretty solid, and the inner ring of white just starts to set (about 2.5 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   Slide the egg to the edge of the [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | pan]] and flip it, ensuring not to flip too high to prevent yolk breakage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   For a runny yolk, cook for only about 30 seconds on the second side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   It's possible to flip it back again if desired, and at this point, the egg is solid enough to use a spatula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### Scrambled Eggs

Scrambled eggs require more fat and slightly higher heat than some other styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

*   Crack eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt per egg, and a splash of milk or water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The added moisture helps the egg expand and fluff with steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   Start with a "not so gentle foam" of [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   Stir constantly like an omelet until the mixture stops being liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   Then, "destroy the omelet" by scraping the egg off the bottom to create big, fluffy ribbons or sheets of curd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Time Sensitivity**: Scrambled eggs cook intensely from all sides, so they are very time-sensitive. If you want them runny inside, you need to remove them from the [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | pan]] even before they appear fully done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

### Omelets (American Diner Style)

*   For a 10-inch [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | pan]], use a minimum of three eggs to avoid a paper-thin, easily torn omelet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   Add salt and milk, and beat the eggs very smooth to loosen the protein structure for a thin, solid sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   Use lots of [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]], even in a [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | non-stick pan]], ensuring [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] coats the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   For an American-style diner omelet, use aggressive foaming [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. (A fancy French omelet uses much lower temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.)
*   Stir constantly and wipe down the sides until the mixture stops being liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   Once it stops flowing, smush it into an even layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   Add fillings while the top is still liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   Turn off the heat and fold before the top looks completely set, ideally when it's still a little gooey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

With eggs that cook from all sides, it's crucial to remove them from the [[choosing_the_right_pan_and_using_nonstick_pans_for_cooking_eggs | pan]] slightly before they are done to your liking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Even mistakes are typically edible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

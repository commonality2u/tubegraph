From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

A *jus* is typically defined as a meaty sauce that has not been thickened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This specific mushroom jus recipe aims to recreate the flavor profile of an inexpensive roast beef au jus often found at catered events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, providing an umami boost through mushroom flavoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Ingredients

*   Red wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   Beef stock (approx. 1 quart / 800ml) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>
*   [[cooking_with_dried_mushroom_powder_for_umami_flavor | Powdered dried mushrooms]] / dried mushroom powder blend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
*   Onion powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
*   Dried mustard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>
*   Optional: Cornstarch or xanthan gum for thickening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>

## Preparation

1.  **Initial Searing and Deglazing**
    *   Begin the sauce by frying garlic and other aromatics from the roast pan on high heat to develop brown flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
    *   Deglaze the pan with about half a cup of red wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This step is optional, but if used, be careful not to add too much red wine as it can become bitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    *   Scrub the bottom of the pan to incorporate any browned bits and allow the wine to reduce slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   Add a quart (approximately 800ml) of beef stock to the pan and bring it to a boil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

2.  **Flavoring with Mushrooms**
    *   Flavoring the jus with mushrooms significantly boosts its umami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   Use [[cooking_with_dried_mushroom_powder_for_umami_flavor | powdered dried mushrooms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Fresh mushrooms are not recommended for this purpose as they can result in a poor flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
    *   Cheap caterers likely use a dehydrated flavoring product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. A suitable product might contain salt, onion powder, dried mushroom powder, and ground mustard seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
    *   If a pre-made blend isn't available, dried mushrooms can be ground in a spice grinder, though achieving a very fine powder can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   Start with a tablespoon of the dried mushroom powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Dried mushrooms have a strong, distinct flavor compared to fresh ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   Add a similar quantity of onion powder and about a teaspoon of dried mustard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Other flavorings can also be explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
    *   Taste the sauce and adjust seasonings. An additional tablespoon of dried mushroom powder may be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Note that additional salt may not be needed after the sauce reduces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

3.  **Thickening (Optional)**
    *   While a traditional jus is not thickened, many roast beef au jus served in the United States have a slight thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
    *   **Cornstarch Slurry**: A common method is to mix about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch with a little water to create a slurry, then pour it into the hot jus and bring it to a boil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
    *   **Xanthan Gum**: For a subtle thickening and a smooth, silky mouthfeel, xanthan gum can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
        *   Xanthan gum disperses in oil, so mix about half a teaspoon into a small amount of olive oil first to prevent clumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
        *   Add a portion of the xanthan gum mixture to the jus, let it cook for a few minutes, and then assess the thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Be cautious not to add too much, as it can result in a "mucous-y" texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
        *   A key benefit of xanthan gum is that the sauce's thickness remains consistent whether hot or cold, unlike cornstarch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

4.  **Finishing**
    *   Reduce the jus by about a third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
    *   Strain the sauce to remove garlic skins and herb sticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
    *   The sauce will develop a skin as it sits, similar to cornstarch-thickened sauces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### Serving Suggestion
To reheat thin slices of roast beef, ladle piping hot jus directly onto the meat on the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. For a kitschy presentation reminiscent of catering, add a decorative sprig of curly parsley, which is tough and won't wilt easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

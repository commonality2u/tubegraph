A method exists for [[baking_techniques_for_pizza_at_home | baking a great pizza]] in a standard home oven without needing a pizza stone or pizza steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Normally, a heavy, thermally conductive slab is used to brown the bottom of the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, as without it, pizza can taste like bread with toppings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This alternative approach achieves a brown, crispy bottom by cooking the pizza directly on the oven grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Broiler Method (Directly on Oven Grate)

This [[pizza_baking_method_without_a_stone_or_steel | method of baking pizza]] requires some practice and results in a taste slightly different from a traditional pie, but it is very quick and tasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Advantages
*   **Speed & Efficiency**
    *   No need to preheat the oven for an hour to heat a stone or steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
    *   The broiler heats up in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, and the grate comes to temperature quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   Total cook time can be as short as seven minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
    *   Allows for immediate re-baking of another pizza, as the grates don't require much time to reheat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   It's an energy-efficient method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Resulting Pizza Characteristics**
    *   Achieves a brown, crispy bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
    *   The sauce retains a brighter color and flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   The cheese melts without overheating, resulting in hardly any grease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   The crust is very crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **Equipment**
    *   Requires no special equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Characteristics of the Result
The pizza produced by this method is amazingly close to a New York-style pizza, but with some differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>:
*   The topside crust, exposed to dry heat, doesn't bond as much with the sauce and cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   The layers are more distinct in the mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   The bottom crust is smooth on the tongue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. These differences are not negative, just distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Preparation Steps
1.  **Oven Setup**: Turn the broiler (also known as a grill in the UK) to its hottest setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Position a clean oven grate high up, typically second from the top position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Allow a few minutes for the grate to heat up; a wet towel should sizzle when placed on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
2.  **Dough Preparation**:
    *   Use a cold-risen dough, stored in the refrigerator for at least a day and up to a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   Work with the dough straight out of the refrigerator; the colder the dough, the better it performs in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   Flour both sides of the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Roll the dough out to an even thickness using a rolling pin or a wine bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This method works best with uniform thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Roll and turn the dough like pastry to prevent sticking and ensure even expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   Aim for an oblong or rectangular shape, as it's easier to maneuver into the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   Roll it slightly less thin than desired, as it will stretch more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   Coat one side of the dough with a very thin film of olive oil, working quickly before the dough warms up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Cooking Process
1.  **First Bake**: Pull the oven grate out, and carefully drape the dough onto it, **oil side down** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Try to stretch any excess dough to hang over the nearest grate, aiming for every inch of dough to be an equal distance from the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Slide the grate in and close the oven door (some people leave it open, but closing provides more even results) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
2.  **Monitoring**: Watch the pizza like a hawk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The first part takes about three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Look for the dough to start to burn, with a few burned spots known as "leopard spotting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. If your broiler is uneven, rotate the dough once it's cooked enough to release from the grates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
3.  **Flipping and Dressing**: Flip the dough over (the oiled, preheated side releases easily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Dress the pizza directly on the grate in the oven to ensure it cooks quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   Use a simple sauce (e.g., ground tomatoes with olive oil, sugar, dried herbs like oregano or basil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Use less sauce than instinct suggests due to the thinness of the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
    *   Add finely grated Parmesan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   Use freshly grated whole milk, low-moisture mozzarella, as pre-grated cheese has anti-caking agents that hinder browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Fresh mozzarella can also be used, but in smaller quantities to avoid sogginess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
4.  **Second Bake**: Slide the pizza back under the broiler, again closing the door for even results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Watch it constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Rotate the pizza if the cheese starts to burn unevenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Cook until the cheese is browned to your liking (about another minute) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
5.  **Cooling**: Transfer the cooked pizza to a cooling rack to maintain a crispy crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. After cooling and steaming off for a few minutes, transfer to a cutting board and slice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Why This Method Works
Baking directly on hot oven grates is essentially grilling the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. It receives:
*   Radiant heat from above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   Some radiation or convection from below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   Conductive heat from the hot grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

This combination of heat sources allows the pizza to cook quicker and lose less moisture before browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Unlike outdoor grilled pizza, this method allows for intense heat from above, achieving great color on the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Less Effective Alternatives

### Hand-Stretched Dough
*   **Problem**: While hand-stretching can create desirable uneven thickness (gossamer thin center, fluffy cornice), this method leads to disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The thin areas burn quickly while thicker areas remain white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Solution**: [[best_practices_for_pizza_dough_preparation | Rolling the dough to a uniform thickness]] is crucial for even cooking with the broiler grate method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Baking on a Sheet Pan
*   **Process**: Roll out dough, rub with a thin film of oil, and place oil-side down on a baking sheet (oil is essential to prevent sticking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Problem**: Cooks much slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. It can take eight minutes to get minimal color on the first side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, resulting in a dry, hard, and over-baked crust that resembles pizza toppings on a hot cracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This is considered "good food, but bad pizza" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Reason**: The baking sheet prevents direct contact with the hot grate and conductive heat transfer. This relates to considerations when [[using_nonstick_pans_vs_cast_iron_for_baking_pizza | using nonstick pans vs cast iron for baking pizza]].

### Baking on a Cooling Rack
*   **Process**: Place oiled dough oil-side down on a cooling rack and slide it onto the oven grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Problem**: While heat is applied to both sides, the dough still doesn't directly touch the hot grates, leading to slower cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. It takes almost five minutes for minimal color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, and the crust can become hard and crackery, not merging with the toppings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Preheating Cooling Rack**: Preheating the cooling rack might help, but many cooling racks are not designed for high oven temperatures and may have coatings that break down or melt under a full-strength broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Even if they can withstand the heat, their thinner metal may retain and transfer less heat than the thicker oven grates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Tips for Success
*   **Experimentation**: [[experimenting_with_new_pizza_recipes_using_extra_dough | Experiment with your own tools]] and methods, as every oven is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Practice**: Broilers have hot spots (e.g., back end to the right) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. It's recommended to make a batch of dough balls and practice this method multiple times in your oven to understand its eccentricities before making dinner for guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Smoke serves to preserve food both physically and chemically, while also imparting desirable flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Ancient humans, specifically Neolithic people, demonstrated evidence of smoking hunted animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Historically, smoke was most useful for preserving meat due to its high pathogen load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While smoke assists in [[history_of_food_preservation_methods | food preservation]], salt curing is generally more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Therefore, safe smoking often begins with at least a short salt cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Smoke as a Preservative

Cold smoking, which is defined as smoking below 85°F (30°C), is primarily used for preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This method results in products like beef jerky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The smoke itself contains chemicals that aid in preservation and contribute to flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Antimicrobial Effects of Smoke

The antimicrobial effects of smoke can be observed using liquid smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Liquid smoke is not an artificial flavoring but actual smoke condensed into a water-based liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. It's produced by burning wood, collecting the smoke, and cooling it to condense the water, which traps beneficial smoke chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Less soluble, potentially harmful chemicals, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), settle in a distinct layer and can be separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

A 2014 literature review demonstrated that liquid smoke could kill or inhibit the reproduction of certain bacteria, including E. coli, at concentrations above 0.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Scientists largely attribute these effects to two primary classes of chemicals found in wood smoke:

*   **Phenols**: These chemicals disrupt the cell membranes of bacteria, causing them to leak and die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Carbonyls**: These bond easily with amino acids in proteins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. When carbonyls enter bacteria, they effectively deactivate enzymes essential for the germs to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Carbonyls also bond with environmental amino acids that bacteria require for survival, essentially ruining their food supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

Despite these effects, smoke alone is not a particularly safe preservative, as its antimicrobial properties vary widely based on factors like smoking method, duration, wood type, and the specific bacteria being targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. For example, Listeria is quite resistant to smoke, as well as salt and acid, and can multiply at refrigerator temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Cooking is the most certain way to kill Listeria in food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Impact on Food Appearance

Smoke also influences the visual characteristics of food, particularly meat. Cold-smoked meat can retain a bright pink color even after being cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. This is due to two chemicals present in smoke:

*   **Carbon Monoxide** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>
*   **Nitric Oxide**: More significantly, nitric oxide forms a much stronger bond with myoglobin, the protein in meat responsible for its purple, pink, or red color depending on its oxidation state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Nitric oxide effectively stabilizes the myoglobin, making the protein less likely to change color and turn brown in response to cooking or long-term air exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Burning bark is particularly good for producing nitric oxide, as trees store a lot of protein in their bark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Despite its benefits, there are [[techniques_and_challenges_of_smoking_food | techniques and challenges of smoking food]] and [[risks_and_safety_concerns_of_smoked_foods | risks and safety concerns of smoked foods]] associated with smoking. Smoking food directly over a fire can lead to high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are carcinogenic compounds found in smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Modern commercial smoking often mitigates this by using indirect smoking setups, where smoke is funneled through a pipe and cooled, causing some PAHs to condense and drop out before reaching the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Ancient people likely did not realize these health hazards existed or prioritized immediate survival over long-term risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

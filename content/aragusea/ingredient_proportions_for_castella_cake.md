[[history_and_origins_of_castella_cake | Castella cake]], a simple sponge cake, is characterized by its light, airy, and "jiggly" [[texture_and_flavors_of_jiggly_cake | texture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Its composition is largely based on eggs, contributing to its unique properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The fundamental ingredient proportions for a successful Castella cake can be scaled to fit various pan sizes using a simple formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Core "Mother Recipe" Proportions

The foundational proportions for Castella cake ingredients are best measured by weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Most variations of this recipe orbit around these simple whole-number ratios:
*   **Four parts eggs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   **One part fat** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   **One part milk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   **One part flour** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   **One part sugar** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>

These proportions provide a reliable starting point for bakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Key Ingredients and Their Role

### Eggs
Eggs are the primary structural component of Castella cake, with half of the cake's mass literally being egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. A typical large chicken egg, without its shell, weighs approximately 50 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Egg whites and yolks are separated for this recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The egg whites are beaten into a foam (meringue), which is crucial for the cake's airy [[texture_and_flavors_of_jiggly_cake | texture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

> [!warning] Egg White Separation
> It is critical to prevent any egg yolk from contaminating the egg whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Egg yolks contain fat, which inhibits the proteins in egg whites from foaming properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Separating eggs one at a time in a separate bowl before adding them to the main batch of whites is recommended to avoid wasting all eggs if one yolk ruptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Fat
The recipe calls for one part fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. While melted butter could be used for flavor, vegetable oil is preferred by professionals because it yields a softer [[texture_and_flavors_of_jiggly_cake | texture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Flour
One part flour is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. While all-purpose flour might work, cake flour is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. [[the_science_of_cake_mixing_and_leavening | Cakes built on egg foams]] can sometimes be tough, so a softer flour like cake flour helps maintain a tender crumb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The structural matrix of this cake is primarily egg, not wheat, so gluten development is not a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Sugar
Although the "mother recipe" suggests one part sugar, a slight deviation can enhance the cake's appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Using a little more than one part sugar can result in a glossier top on the cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Sugar is incorporated into the egg whites gradually at the end of the whipping process, as it significantly strengthens the meringue foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Minor Additions

*   **Cornstarch:** A small amount, about a tenth of the flour's weight (e.g., 25 grams for 250 grams flour), helps make the interior crumb finer and more pudding-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Vanilla Extract:** A generous amount of vanilla can be added for flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Different extracts (e.g., orange) can be used to experiment with flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Salt:** Approximately a heaped teaspoon for a large batch, which equates to about half a gram of salt per egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Cream of Tartar (or other acid):** Added to egg whites, acids like cream of tartar make egg foams more elastic, allowing them to mix with other ingredients without deflating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Lemon juice or white vinegar can be used as alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Flavor Variations
Beyond vanilla, other flavorings or additions like chocolate chips can be incorporated to enhance the cake's taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

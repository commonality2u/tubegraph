Baking a giant sponge cake, particularly the Castella-style jiggly cake, presents several unique challenges, especially when attempting to replicate professional results at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These cakes, often seen in bakeries from Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia, are known for their incredibly soft, pudding-like, and "wubba wubba" texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Achieving the Desired Texture
The primary goal for this cake is its distinctive "jiggly" and "wubba wubba" texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Pan Size and Shape**: Using a pan that is too small or too short can result in a cake with too much rigid surface relative to its inner mass, preventing the desired jiggly texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. A tall-sided pan is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Simulating Steam Injection Ovens**: Professional bakeries often use steam injection ovens to achieve the cake's unique qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. At home, the best way to simulate this environment is by baking the cake in a [[baking_techniques_for_jiggly_cake | water bath]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Oven Temperature and Fan Use**: An oven temperature of 325째F (160째C) is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Using a convection fan can cause the top of the cake to crack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Batter Consistency**: A thinner batter generally results in a smoother, more attractive top surface for the cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Egg Separation and Foam Stability
The cake's structure heavily relies on a stable egg foam, making egg handling critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Yolk Contamination**: A significant challenge is separating the egg whites from the yolks without any yolk contaminating the whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Egg whites will not foam up if there is any fat (from the yolk) in the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. To avoid wasting numerous eggs, it's safer to separate eggs one at a time into a separate bowl before adding the clean white to the main bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Strengthening the Foam**: Adding an acid like cream of tartar, lemon juice, or white vinegar to the egg whites makes the foam more elastic, allowing it to mix with other ingredients without deflating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Sugar Incorporation**: Adding sugar too early to the egg whites can prevent the foam from forming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. It's safer to mix the sugar in gradually towards the end, which also strengthens the foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Mixing the Meringue**: While one might expect to gently fold in the egg foam to prevent deflation, the large volume of meringue in this recipe makes achieving a homogeneous mixture through folding difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Taiwanese bakeries often straight up whip the ingredients together, indicating that robust mixing doesn't necessarily deflate the cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The structural matrix of this cake is egg, not wheat, mitigating the risk of toughness from overmixing flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Baking and Doneness
*   **Preventing Overcooking**: The [[baking_techniques_for_jiggly_cake | water bath]] serves two purposes: creating a steam environment to prevent the top from setting hard and restricting upward expansion, and keeping the sides of the cake from overcooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Water's boiling point of 212째F (100째C) is below the browning temperature, keeping the cake sides light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Determining Doneness**: A smaller Castella cake might need an hour, but a larger one can take up to an hour and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The cake is done when a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. If the top is browning too quickly before the inside is cooked, the oven heat can be adjusted down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Post-Baking Handling and Flavor
*   **Extracting the Delicate Cake**: Sponge cakes are both sticky and delicate, making extraction from the pan challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Lining the pan with parchment paper, creating a "sling" to lift the cake out, is crucial to prevent breakage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Slicing**: A very long knife is needed to slice these large cakes cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Initial Flavor**: When eaten warm, the cake may initially taste unpleasant, described as "farts," due to the sulfur content in the high proportion of eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This taste dissipates as the cake cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The cooled cake tastes nice, but its primary appeal is its unique springy and pillowy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## Overview of Deboned Turkey Roasting
A more involved, but advantageous, approach to [[roasting_techniques_for_turkey | roasting]] a turkey involves fully [[deboning_a_turkey | deboning]] it before cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This method allows for all the hard work to be done in advance, making the holiday feast day simpler, as the meat is boneless and easier to slice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The bones can be used to make a turkey demi-glace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It is suggested to start the preparation two days before the feast, though the day before is also possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This technique can be applied to any size bird, including a 20-pound turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Deboning Process
To begin the [[deboning_a_turkey | deboning]] process, you will need kitchen scissors and a boning knife, or any sharp knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Removing the Central Skeleton
1.  **Position the Bird:** Flip the turkey so its backbone is facing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
2.  **Identify Joints:** The skeleton protrudes at four main points: the shoulder joints and the hip joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. All other meat simply sits on top of the bones and can be peeled off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
3.  **Cut Along Spine:** Cut straight down along one side of the spine, allowing the knife to follow the bones, peeling the meat off the central skeleton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
4.  **Dislocate Hip Joint:** Upon reaching the hip joint, use kitchen scissors to grip around the joint, twist hard to dislocate it, and then snip away at the ligaments connecting the femur to the pelvic girdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
5.  **Dislocate Shoulder Joint:** Repeat the same process for the shoulder joint, twisting to lever it apart and snipping or cutting ligaments attaching the humerus to the scapula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
6.  **Continue Peeling:** Once both joints on one side are cut, continue peeling meat off the ribs, one slice at a time, following the bones with your knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Stop when you reach the sternum (breastbone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
7.  **Repeat for Other Side:** Rotate the bird to perform the same steps on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The wing or shoulder joint can often be dislocated by hand on a big turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
8.  **Separate Carcass:** Once both sides are free, peel the meat off the sternum and break off the wishbone to free the central skeleton (carcass) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This carcass, along with the neck and giblets, is excellent for gravy or demi-glace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

**Note:** Basic knowledge of bird anatomy is recommended. Practice on whole chickens, both cooked and raw, before attempting this on a large turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Deboning Legs and Wings
1.  **Legs and Thighs:**
    *   Cut down to the thigh bone, then peel meat off the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   Slip the knife under the bone and saw out toward where the hip was to free that end of the femur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    *   Repeat a similar process for the knee and shin bone (tibia): cut down its length, peel meat, and then saw under the knee, peeling the tibia off the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    *   At the ankle, lever the bones over and use scissors to snip them off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Save these bones for sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   **Tendons:** Large turkeys have huge tendons in the legs, making them virtually inedible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Use pliers to grab the tendon by the end, hold the meat back, and pull hard to extract them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Save these for sauce too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
2.  **Wings:**
    *   You can cut off whole wings and add them to the sauce pot, as there isn't much prime meat on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, to debone the upper portion (drumette), cut down along the humerus and peel meat off the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
    *   Slip the knife under the bone and saw out the winglets; the wing tip is typically discarded or saved for sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Final Trim and Shaping
*   Trim any remaining bits of cartilage or blubbery fat to ensure the roast is 100% edible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. All trimmings are valuable for sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   Flip back the pectoralis minor muscles (poultry tenderloin) to help the meat sit at a more even thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   Butterfly the thickest part of the breast with one or two shallow cuts to help it lie flatter and cook more evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Seasoning and Curing
Once deboned and laid flat, the turkey is ready for [[seasoning_and_dry_curing_chicken | seasoning and dry curing]].
1.  **Initial Seasoning:** Apply as much salt as you would normally use to flavor the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Add plenty of pepper, dried thyme, sage, garlic powder, and onion powder to the inside (meat side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
2.  **Separate Parts (Optional but Recommended):** A 20-pound deboned turkey will likely be too large for one baking tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. It can be cut in half through the breast or, more advantageously, by snipping off the leg quarters. Only skin typically connects the breast to the thigh, making the cut obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This allows the dark meat and white meat to be placed on separate trays, offering independent control over their cooking, as they cook differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
3.  **Exterior Seasoning:** Apply salt and pepper to the skin side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Add herbs, but avoid garlic or onion powder on top, as they can burn under intense dry heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
4.  **Tucking and Drying:** Tuck any exposed meat under the skin to prevent it from becoming leathery in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Leave the skin uncovered in the fridge to dry out, similar to preparing Peking duck, which helps it become crispy during [[roasting_techniques_for_turkey | roasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Store raw meat trays on the bottom shelf of the fridge to prevent leaks onto other food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Demi-Glace Preparation
The turkey bones, neck, skin, and trimmings are used to create a demi-glace.
1.  **Roast Bones:** Place bones, neck, skin, trimmings, and halved onions on a [[pot_roast_cooking_techniques | roasting]] tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Roast at 400°F (200°C) to brown and develop flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
2.  **Add Tomato Paste:** After about 30 minutes, squirt on some tomato paste. This boosts umami and darkens the color without making it tomatoey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Flip the pieces and ensure nothing burns, as burnt bits will concentrate in the demi-glace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
3.  **Simmer Stock:** After about an hour of [[roasting_techniques_for_turkey | roasting]], transfer the roasted bones to a large stock pot or, as demonstrated, simmer directly in the [[pot_roast_cooking_techniques | roasting]] tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
4.  **Add Water and Aromatics:** Add cold, filtered water (cold water helps extract protein, though its impact can be minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>). For an umami boost, add dried porcini mushrooms and whole peppercorns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Bay leaves can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
5.  **Long Simmer:** Bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Cover with foil if no lid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Simmer for at least a couple of hours, topping off water as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. For true demi-glace, which thickens with gelatin, it needs to simmer long enough to dissolve collagen into gelatin, often 16 hours or overnight at a very low bubble to prevent evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Bones that break easily indicate full extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
6.  **Strain and Reduce:** Fish out most solids and strain the liquid through a sieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Bring the strained stock to a boil and reduce by about a third for easier handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
7.  **Optional Gelatin:** A packet of unflavored gelatin can be added to ensure plenty of sauce with desired texture, without reducing the stock as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Boil to dissolve powder and then strain again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
8.  **Cool and Skim Fat:** Rapidly cool the stock using an ice bath (a large bowl of ice water with the stock bowl nested inside) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This rapid cooling prevents microbial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Cover and refrigerate; fat will rise and solidify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Since turkey fat is lower in saturated fat, it may not solidify into a firm puck like beef fat, but the underlying stock will be a firm jello, allowing the fat to be scraped off cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
9.  **Concentrate Demi-Glace:** Transfer the "meaty jello" to a wide pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Boil it down until syrupy to create a meat glaze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. It's crucial to remove fat beforehand, as a concentrated glaze cannot hold fat without emulsifying help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Stir frequently once it becomes syrupy to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
10. **Flavoring and Finishing:** A glass of white wine can be added for brightness, floral notes, and sweetness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Stir or cook at a lower temperature for longer to prevent burning, as sugar is now present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Season with salt to taste, as the stock initially contained only natural salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Chill and reheat for serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
11. **Serving with Butter (Optional):** To increase sauce volume, stir in a bunch of butter at a very low heat, ensuring no bubbling, to melt it without breaking the butter's natural emulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This enhances flavor, changes texture, and makes it feel warmer or fluffier on the palate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## Roasting the Deboned Turkey
On the day of the feast:
1.  **Prepare for Roasting:** Take the trays of turkey out of the fridge. After 48 hours, the skin will be very dry, and most of the salt from the dry cure will have absorbed into the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
2.  **Roasting Temperature:** Roast at 400°F (200°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
3.  **Basting (Optional):** Basting once or twice will reduce final crispiness slightly due to water in the juices but can improve flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. For crazy crispy skin, do not baste; rub skin with oil before [[roasting_techniques_for_turkey | roasting]] and do not touch it again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
4.  **Cooking Time and Temperature:** A deboned turkey cooks much faster than a bone-in bird. A conventional turkey could take five hours, but deboned, it takes just over an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
    *   **Dark Meat:** Dark meat pieces are smaller when deboned and have more surface area, cooking faster. It's often done when white meat is still cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Preferred internal temperature for dark meat is 185°F (85°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
    *   **White Meat:** Do not cook white meat past 160°F (71°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Carryover heat will raise it a few degrees further to minimum safe temperatures as it rests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
5.  **Achieving Color:** For more color, increase heat significantly at the very end of [[roasting_techniques_for_turkey | roasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Carving and Serving
[[carving_and_serving_turkey | Slicing]] a deboned turkey is significantly easier than a traditional one, as there are no bones to work around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. This reduces stress on the day of the [[thanksgiving_turkey_preparation | Thanksgiving turkey preparation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

*   The salt cure and air drying make the skin incredibly crisp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   Dark meat skin, which is usually soggy when bone-in, is crisp with this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   Every slice from the leg is clean and edible due to the removal of bony tendons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
*   The demi-glace is much stronger than gravy, so diners should use it sparingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### Note on Brining
While this method uses a dry brine, the presenter expresses a personal preference against brined turkey meat, both wet and dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. A wet brine can give meat the texture of bologna, and a dry brine can make it too firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The uniform saltiness from brining can also drown out the subtle flavor of turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. It is suggested to let the sauce bring the salt and to season conventionally right before [[roasting_techniques_for_turkey | roasting]] if brining is not desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. However, many people enjoy poultry brines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

This method provides more time and "brain space" on the feast day to focus on side dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

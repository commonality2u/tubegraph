Using processed American cheese, particularly Kraft Deli Deluxe American cheese, offers distinct advantages in recipes like macaroni and cheese, setting it apart from dishes made with traditional methods or "real" cheeses.

## Simplified Process and Texture
One of the key benefits of using processed American cheese is that it eliminates the requirement for a roux (a mixture of butter and flour) to act as a thickener or binder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This greatly simplifies the cooking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The emulsifiers found in this processed cheese are believed to be responsible for this function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Consequently, the final dish achieves a significantly smoother texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This contrasts with efforts to create a traditional [[comparison_of_traditional_mornay_sauce_and_processed_cheese_sauce | mornay sauce]], which often incorporate a roux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Enhanced Flavor and Consistency
Despite its processed nature, this type of cheese contributes to a superior final product. An unbiased opinion suggests that the flavor is "stronger" and the texture "far smoother" than mac and cheese prepared with "quote-unquote real cheese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Furthermore, processed American cheese already contains a substantial amount of salt, often negating the need to add more during preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Quality Considerations
It's important to note that not all processed American cheese is the same. For instance, Kraft Deli Deluxe American cheese is distinct from Kraft Singles because it contains enough real cheddar or Colby cheese to be recognized as "cheese" by the U.S. government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Other types may be labeled as "cheese product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

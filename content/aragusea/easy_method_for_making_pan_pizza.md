From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 
This article outlines a straightforward and reliable method for preparing a delicious pan pizza, a style originating in the American Midwest and popularized by a well-known global chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach aims for a much browner bottom crust and is more energy-efficient and controllable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Pan Pizza Dough

While any pizza dough can be used, this recipe suggests a specific blend for optimal pan pizza results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Ingredients
*   **Flour**: One cup of bread flour (or all-purpose), approximately 120 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Salt**: Half a teaspoon, about 3 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Sugar**: Two to three grams, half a teaspoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Dry Yeast**: Half a teaspoon, one to two grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Olive Oil**: A couple of teaspoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Garlic Powder**: A dash; it works well with thick crusts and enhances flavor inside the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Milk**: Half a cup, used instead of water to create nice caramelly notes in the brown surface, similar to how powdered milk products are used in some commercial crusts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Scalding milk is not necessary if it's pasteurized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Dough Preparation Steps
1.  Combine dry ingredients and add milk and olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  Adjust milk as needed to achieve a wet, sticky dough, which bakes up fluffier for pan pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
3.  Knead the dough by squishing and grinding it between your palms until it's smooth and elastic enough to form a thin sheet without tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
4.  Form into a smooth ball, place back in the bowl, cover, and let it rise for one to two hours until doubled in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, the dough can be placed directly in the fridge for a slow fermentation over a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Pan and Dough Preparation for Second Rise

The second rise takes place directly in the pan, a key step for a lighter, fluffier pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Pan Choice
A 10-inch Teflon non-stick pan with an oven-safe handle is recommended over [[Using nonstick pans vs cast iron for baking pizza | cast iron]] for ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Oiling and Seasoning the Pan
1.  Add a small amount of olive oil to the pan (too much can result in a fried taste) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
2.  Incorporate seasonings into the oil: a pinch of dried oregano, basil, chili flakes, and a tiny pinch of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This creates a distinct flavor layer on the pizza's bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
3.  Completely coat the pan with the seasoned oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Dough Placement and Second Rise
1.  Place the dough ball into the oiled pan and mash it straight in with your fingertips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This technique helps achieve a more even thickness throughout the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
2.  Stretch the dough slightly past the pan's corners, as it will contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
3.  Rub a thin layer of oil on top of the dough to prevent drying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
4.  Allow the dough to undergo a second rise in the pan for at least half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Skipping this step can result in a dense, doughy crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Sauce Preparation
For the sauce, use canned crushed or ground tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. If using a different brand, spike it with a little tomato paste for extra flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. A third of a cup of sauce is perfect for a pan pizza of this size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Sauce Seasonings
*   **Marjoram**: A new favorite pizza herb that smells like tea but tastes like oregano crossed with thyme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Oregano and Basil** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Sugar**: A tiny pinch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Chili Flakes and Black Pepper** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Olive Oil**: A dab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   Stir all ingredients together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Cheese Selection and Preparation

### Mozzarella
For pan pizzas, part-skim, low-moisture mozzarella is preferred over whole milk low-moisture mozzarella, as it browns better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. An eight-ounce block will yield about five or six ounces (150 grams) for one pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. It's crucial to avoid pre-grated cheese, as the anti-clumping starch on it is likely to burn with this cooking method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Parmesan
Grated parmesan is sprinkled over the sauce layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. For pizza, the pre-grated "fake" parmesan is preferred for its taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Hiding it under the mozzarella layer helps prevent it from burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Topping Preparation: Gremolata

For a unique and flavorful topping, consider using gremolata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Gremolata Ingredients
*   A tiny clove of fresh garlic, eaten raw, so keep it small due to its strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   A couple of shavings of lemon zest, avoiding the white pith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   A small bunch of fresh parsley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Chop these three ingredients together; the interaction creates a flavor more than the sum of its parts, making dishes taste fresher and more sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Baking Method

This method involves two distinct stages: pre-browning the crust on the stovetop and then finishing it under the broiler. This differs from other [[Alternative methods of baking pizza | baking techniques for pizza at home]] or [[Making New Yorkstyle pizza at home | Making New York-style pizza at home]], and it doesn't require a [[Pizza baking method without a stone or steel | pizza stone or steel]].

### Stage 1: Pre-Browning the Crust on the Stovetop
1.  Heat the pan on medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
2.  Simultaneously, preheat the oven's broiler ([[using_an_oven_broiler_for_pizza | grill]] in British English) to maximum, with a rack positioned close to the top element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
3.  After about a minute, the dough will start puffing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. After four minutes, you'll start to smell it browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
4.  Completely finish browning the bottom crust before adding any toppings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
5.  Use a soft spatula to lift the dough and check the bottom, or shake the non-stick pan like an omelette to ensure it's not stuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Rotate the pan if browning unevenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Cook until the bottom is browned to your liking, even a little burnt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
6.  Remove the pan from the heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Stage 2: Topping and Broiling
1.  Smooth the prepared sauce edge-to-edge across the pre-baked crust, ensuring no bare ring of crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The sauce on the sides will caramelize sweetly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
2.  Dust a layer of parmesan over the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
3.  Distribute the mozzarella cheese edge-to-edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. The cheese touching the pan sides will create delicious crispy bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
4.  Place the pan under the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Keep the oven door closed for faster and better cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   **Note on Teflon Pans**: While generally advised against using Teflon under a broiler due to potential fumes, this method uses it for only about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Tests show the exposed Teflon doesn't reach temperatures where PTFE breaks down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If concerned or if you have pet birds (which are sensitive to polymer fumes), use [[Using nonstick pans vs cast iron for baking pizza | cast iron]] instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
5.  Pull the pizza when the cheese is browned to your liking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Finishing and Serving

1.  Sprinkle the prepared gremolata over the hot pizza immediately after baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
2.  Allow the pizza to cool in the pan for just a few minutes until it solidifies enough to be removed intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
3.  Transfer the pizza to a cooling rack as soon as possible to ensure a crispier bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The non-stick pan allows the pizza to slide out easily like an omelet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
4.  Let the pizza cool down further on the rack before eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
5.  If the bottom becomes soggy, you can easily re-fry it for a few minutes until it sizzles again to restore crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
6.  Cut the pizza into small slices due to its thickness and richness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## Key Characteristics of Pan Pizza

*   **Crust**: The milk in the dough creates a slightly cakey texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Frico**: The crispy, delicious brown cheesy bits that form on the rim where the cheese touches the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

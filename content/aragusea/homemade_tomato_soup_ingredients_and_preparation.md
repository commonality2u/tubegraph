Homemade tomato soup is described as an unbeatable cold-weather combination, especially when paired with a classic grilled cheese sandwich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This recipe aims to create a soup that tastes distinctly like soup, rather than just a bowl of [[making_homemade_tomato_sauce | tomato sauce]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>

*   Onion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
*   Fennel bulb (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>
*   Butter (preferred) or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
*   Black pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   Celery seeds (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
*   Flour (approximately 1/4 cup or 30 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>
*   Canned tomatoes and their juice (two 28-ounce cans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>
    *   *Tip:* Using high-quality canned tomatoes, especially those from California, is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   White wine (optional, about a glass) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
*   Water (for thinning and to taste) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
*   Salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
*   Tomato paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>
*   Sugar (optional, if tomatoes aren't sweet enough) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>

## Preparation Steps

### Vegetable Preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>
Since the soup will be pureed, precision cutting of the onion is not necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
If using fennel bulb:
*   Chop the bulb finely so it cooks at the same rate as the onion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   If you plan to strain the soup, you can chop and add the stalks; otherwise, it's recommended to only use the bulb as stalks contain fibers that can be unpleasant if not strained out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Cooking the Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
1.  Melt a generous amount of butter in a pot over medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
2.  Add the chopped onion and fennel (if using) and saut√© without browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
3.  Grind in some black pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
4.  Add celery seeds (if using) early so they soften by the time the soup is eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
5.  Stir in flour to create a roux, which will give the soup a velvety texture. Don't worry about lumps as it will be pureed later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Simmering the Soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
1.  Before anything browns, add the canned tomatoes and their juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
2.  If using whole tomatoes, you can let them break apart naturally as they cook, or use a potato masher to accelerate the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
3.  Add a glass of white wine (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   *Note:* Start with less liquid, as you can always add more water at the end to adjust consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
4.  Turn the heat down to low and simmer for up to an hour, scraping the bottom occasionally to prevent sticking and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Pureeing and Finishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
1.  After simmering (e.g., 40 minutes), use an immersion blender to puree the soup directly in the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This offers more control over the texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
2.  Taste the soup. Add salt, water (if too thick), and squeeze in some tomato paste to enhance tomato flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
3.  Optional: Add sugar if the tomatoes are not naturally sweet enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Optional Straining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>
If you desire a super smooth texture similar to canned tomato soups, you can strain the pureed soup:
1.  Place a sieve over a bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
2.  Add a manageable amount of soup to the sieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
3.  Use a stiff spoon to grind the soup through the sieve until only plant fibers remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. A food mill could also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Garnishes and Serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>

### Quick Chili Oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>
This garnish adds variety to the soup's otherwise homogenous texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
1.  Combine dried chili flakes and olive oil in a small pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  Add a crushed garlic clove; its water content acts as a thermometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
3.  Infuse on low heat, ensuring the garlic is just barely sizzling to avoid burning flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Other Garnishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>
*   Chop and scatter fennel fronds on top for a very nice touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Serve with a grilled cheese sandwich, especially one cut into triangles for easy dipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>
This recipe makes a large quantity of soup. The remainder can be frozen for later use on a snowy day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

The widespread adoption of raw and paleo diets is based on "suspect notions" about human evolution and bodily functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While diets restricting refined carbohydrates and processed foods can be beneficial, the idea that humans are inherently meant to eat only raw foods is challenged by anthropological evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Cooking Hypothesis

Humans have been [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking]] their food since before they were Homo sapiens, suggesting that [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking]] might be integral to human identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This concept is known in anthropology as the [[biological_and_social_impacts_of_cooking | cooking hypothesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The advantages of [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking]] for early human ancestors remain relevant today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Scholars believe that Homo erectus, a human ancestor, began eating meat approximately two and a half million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | Cooking]] itself was invented around one million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. It became a widespread practice about 250,000 years ago, which coincides with the appearance of the first anatomically modern humans, Homo sapiens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

According to Dr. Jessica Ham, an anthropology professor at Oxford College of Emory University, these events are interrelated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>:
> "Once we started [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking]] we were able to extract a lot more energy and that really helps further push us into sort of being the human entities that we now understand ourselves to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## [[biological_and_social_impacts_of_cooking | Biological and Social Impacts of Cooking]]

### Biological Evolution
The shift from a fully raw diet to one that included cooked foods and meat led to significant [[nutritional_benefits_of_cooking_food | nutritional benefits of cooking food]] and biological changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Humans began extracting more energy from their food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, leading to:
*   **Shrinking Guts:** The size of the human digestive system is proportionally much smaller compared to animals like goats, which require extensive internal hardware to break down raw plant matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Changing Teeth:** The shape and size of human teeth changed as there was less need to grind raw, tough foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Energy for Brain Expansion:** [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | Cooking]] allows for the "pre-digestion" of nutrient-dense foods outside the body, reducing the work required by the digestive system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This freed-up energy could then be directed towards brain development and expansion of cognitive capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Less body mass and time dedicated to digestion meant more resources for other activities, contributing to the development of civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Social Evolution
Beyond biology, [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking]] also played a crucial role in social evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Community Development:** [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | Cooking]] enabled communities to extract more from their shared food supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This efficiency allowed some members of society to specialize in roles other than farming, such as architects, soldiers, stonemasons, priests, and blacksmiths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Social Act:** Dr. Ham, a cultural anthropologist, emphasizes that [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking]] is an inherently social act, fostering cooperation and social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. In many cultures, particularly outside contemporary North America, raw foods are not considered a proper meal; food is expected to be cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. For example, in Ghana, eating raw food would be mocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## [[Nutritional_benefits_of_cooking_food | Nutritional Benefits of Cooking]]

Dr. Tim Crowe, a nutrition researcher and podcast host, highlights that while [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking]] may destroy some nutrients, these losses are typically very small and are far outweighed by the benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>:

> "The benefits are you actually make some nutrients more available you make some food more easily digestible and you actually make it safer as well because you kill off a lot of the bacteria that causes food poisoning which is a major cause of illness and sickness in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Enhanced Bioavailability
[[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | Cooking]] can increase the bioavailability of certain nutrients, meaning the body is better able to absorb and use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Lycopene:** For instance, [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking]] tomatoes increases the absorption of lycopene, a vitamin A antioxidant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Legumes:** It is "virtually impossible" to digest beans and lentils without [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking]] them first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

Some proponents of raw food diets claim that reduced bioavailability is a benefit, leading to fewer absorbed calories and potential weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. While raw food diets can lead to weight loss by limiting food choices and reducing processed food intake, intentionally consuming food without fully utilizing its [[nutritional_benefits_of_cooking_food | nutritional benefits]] is considered inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### Food Safety
[[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | Cooking]] significantly enhances food safety by killing bacteria that cause food poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This benefit is particularly vital in developing countries where food and water supplies may not be sterile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## [[invention_and_evolution_of_cooking_vessels | Invention and Evolution of Cooking Vessels]]

The [[invention_and_evolution_of_cooking_vessels | advent of cooking vessels]] further enhanced the extractive powers of [[cooking_techniques_and_philosophy | cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Things like stone basins and later [[development_of_pottery_for_cooking | water-safe pottery]] allowed humans to extract more nutrients from their food through boiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Boiling vs. Roasting
While [[early_methods_of_cooking_and_roasting | ancient humans]] are often romantically imagined roasting meat over an open flame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, this method yields very little from tough wild animal meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Boiling, however, allows meat to literally fall off the bone after a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Moreover, proteins and other nutrients that might be lost during roasting are conveniently dissolved in the broth, which can then be consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This highlights the importance of the [[history_of_food_boiling_techniques | history of food boiling techniques]] in human [[history_of_food_preservation_methods | diet and preservation]].

## Modern Fad Diets

Modern fad diets like paleo and ketogenic diets, while sometimes promoting healthier eating by eliminating processed foods, often rely on questionable historical or scientific premises.

### Paleo Diet
The Paleo diet, which excludes grains, legumes, and dairy based on the assumption that Stone Age ancestors did not consume them, is contradicted by archaeological evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Grains, for example, were eaten deep in the Paleolithic era, long before the agricultural revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Furthermore, many vegetables consumed by Paleo dieters today are modern creations resulting from millennia of human selective breeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Ketogenic Diet
The modern ketogenic diet was originally developed in the early 20th century as a preventive treatment for seizures in children with epilepsy, not for obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This diet forces the body to produce ketone bodies for brain fuel by replacing nearly all carbohydrate calories with fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

For weight loss, few people adhere to the extreme fat-to-carb ratio (around 50 grams of carbohydrates per day) required to induce true ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. As Dr. Crowe notes, most people cannot maintain a true ketogenic diet for more than three to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Many nutrition experts agree that the primary dietary problem in affluent societies is excessive consumption of processed foods, sugary items, and fast food, rather than home-baked bread or fresh pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Any diet plan that eliminates these highly processed foods is likely to be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

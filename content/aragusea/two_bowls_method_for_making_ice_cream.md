The two bowls method is a favored technique for [[homemade_ice_cream_making_techniques | making ice cream without an ice cream maker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This method requires no special equipment and can yield at least a couple of pints of ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Equipment and Ingredients

### Essential Equipment
*   **Two Metal Bowls:** One large (e.g., 10-quart/9.5 liters) and one smaller (e.g., 4-quart/4 liters) that nests inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The outer bowl's material doesn't matter, but the inner bowl should be metal and thermally conductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The outer bowl should be at least twice as big as the inner bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Hand Mixer:** For beating the mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. A whisk can also be used, but it requires more effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Lidded Freezer-Safe Container:** For storing the finished ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Basic [[philadelphia_style_versus_french_style_ice_cream | Philadelphia Style]] Ice Cream Base
This method starts with an ice cream base in its simplest form: sugar, cream, and milk, with no eggs or pre-cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   1 pint (2 cups/475 ml) cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   1 cup (235 ml) evaporated milk (or regular milk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
    *   Evaporated milk, due to its higher protein content, results in a smoother texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Dried milk powder is an alternative for similar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   ¾ cup (150 grams) sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
*   Vanilla extract (optional, but recommended) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   Ice (enough to fill the outer bowl halfway) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
    *   Normal ice cubes work fine, though crushed ice has more surface area and can make better contact with the salt and inner bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   Salt (e.g., Kosher salt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
    *   Roughly one part salt to four parts ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Salt lowers the melting point of ice, creating supercooled water that chills the inner bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Ice cream salt is an option, often cheaper due to impurities, but not necessary if other salt is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Process

1.  **Pre-chill:** Place both bowls and all ingredients in the freezer for 10-15 minutes before starting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  **Prepare Ice Bath:** Fill the outer bowl halfway with ice. Stir in salt (about 1 part salt to 4 parts ice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
3.  **Combine Ingredients:** Nest the inner bowl into the ice. Pour the cream, milk, sugar, and any flavorings (like vanilla) into the inner bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
4.  **Phase 1 Beating:** Use a hand mixer on the lowest setting to beat the mixture for about 8-10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Regularly scrape any mixture freezing to the walls of the bowl back into the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The mixture will become fluffy, similar to whipped cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Stop when the mixture doesn't seem to get any stiffer or colder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
5.  **First Freeze:** Place the entire rig (outer bowl with ice and inner bowl with mixture) into the freezer for about an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. If the full rig doesn't fit, put the inner bowl in the freezer and recharge the outer bowl with fresh ice before Phase 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
6.  **Phase 2 Beating:** Remove the rig from the freezer and beat the mixture again for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The mixture will immediately deflate into something that looks like ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Scrape any frozen parts from the walls to spread the cold evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This step helps pop excess air bubbles and breaks down large ice crystals into smaller, smoother ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Stop when the mixture starts to visibly melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
7.  **Add Mix-ins (Optional):** If [[incorporating_fruits_and_other_mixins_into_homemade_ice_cream | adding chunks]] like chocolate chips, cookie crumbs, or fruit solids, stir them in after Phase 2 beating, just before transferring to the container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
8.  **Final Freeze:** Pour the ice cream into a lidded freezer-safe container and place it in the freezer as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Let it harden for at least 24 hours for best results; insufficient hardening can lead to rapid melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Variations

### [[philadelphia_style_versus_french_style_ice_cream | French Style Ice Cream]] (Frozen Custard)
This variation uses egg yolks to create a richer base, requiring pre-cooking of the custard.
1.  **Separate Eggs:** Separate six egg yolks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
2.  **Combine Yolks and Sugar:** Whisk about half of the ¾ cup of sugar into the egg yolks to break them up and smooth them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
3.  **Heat Cream and Sugar:** In a pot, combine the remaining sugar and 1 pint of cream, bringing it to a simmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Add a pinch of salt to improve flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
4.  **Temper Yolks:** Slowly drizzle the simmering cream mixture into the egg yolks while whisking continuously to prevent curdling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
5.  **Cook Custard:** Pour everything back into the pot and simmer for a few more minutes until it thickens slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
6.  **Cool Custard:** Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and 1 cup of cold regular milk. The cold milk helps cool the custard faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
7.  **Strain and Chill:** Strain the custard into another bowl to remove any "chunkies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Cool the custard completely, which may take many hours, before proceeding with the two bowls churning method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
8.  **Churn:** Follow the standard two bowls method, chilling the full rig for 10-15 minutes, preparing the ice bath, beating in Phase 1, freezing for an hour, and then beating again in Phase 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### [[incorporating_fruits_and_other_mixins_into_homemade_ice_cream | Fruit Mix-ins]] (e.g., Peaches)
For fruit additions, preparation is key to prevent icy chunks.
1.  **Prepare Fruit:** Peel peaches (optional, but prevents papery texture) and fillet the meat off the pits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Chop the fruit into a coarse grind; larger chunks will freeze solid and hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
2.  **Macerate:** Scatter sugar and a little lime juice over the chopped fruit. The acid helps prevent browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Let it sit for about an hour until the sugar breaks everything down and the fruit can be easily smashed with a fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
3.  **Separate Juice:** Before churning the ice cream base, squeeze as much juice as possible from the fruit pulp into the ice cream mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The base needs to be churned with most of the water content already inside to prevent the fruit juice from freezing hard and crunchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
4.  **Add Solids:** Stir in the fruit solids right at the end of Phase 2 beating, just before transferring the ice cream to the freezer container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

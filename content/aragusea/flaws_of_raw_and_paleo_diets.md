The raw and paleo diets are considered by some to be among the "stupidest" fad diets due to their reliance on "very suspect notions" of how human bodies work and evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While any diet that restricts refined carbohydrates and processed foods can offer benefits, particularly for those in overfed societies, the specific claims of these diets face significant scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Raw Food Diet

Advocates of the raw food diet often claim it is more "natural" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However, humans have been cooking food since before the emergence of *Homo sapiens*, with cooking potentially being a key factor in our evolution into *Homo sapiens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This concept is known in anthropology as the [[historical_evolution_of_human_diet_and_cooking | cooking hypothesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### The Cooking Hypothesis and Human Evolution
Scholars believe that *Homo erectus* began eating meat approximately two and a half million years ago and invented cooking about a million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Cooking became a widespread practice around 250,000 years ago, coinciding with the appearance of the first anatomically modern humans, *Homo sapiens* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

According to Dr. Jessica Ham, an anthropology professor at Oxford College of Emory University, the shift to a diet including cooked meat allowed humans to extract more energy from their food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This led to:
*   **Shrinking Guts**: As food was pre-digested externally through cooking, the human digestive system became proportionally smaller compared to other animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Changing Teeth**: The size and shape of human teeth evolved because there was less need to grind raw, tough materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Brain Expansion**: Less body mass and time dedicated to digestion freed up energy, allowing for the expansion of brain capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This energy redirection contributed to the development of complex human activities and civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Social and Cultural Importance of Cooking
From a cultural anthropology perspective, cooking fostered communities by allowing them to extract more from shared food supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This freed some members of society from constant farming duties, enabling the specialization of labor into roles like architects, soldiers, and priests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Dr. Ham emphasizes that cooking is an inherently social act, contributing significantly to human cooperation and social development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. In many cultures worldwide, food is considered cooked, and raw foods are not seen as a proper meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. For example, in Ghana, eating raw food would be mocked and not considered a meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. [[Cultural identity and dietary distinctions | Cultural identity and dietary distinctions]] play a significant role here.

### Nutritional Benefits of Cooking
Dr. Tim Crowe, a nutrition researcher, states that while cooking may destroy a small amount of nutrients, the benefits far outweigh any negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Key benefits include:
*   **Increased Bioavailability**: Cooking makes some nutrients more available for absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. For instance, cooking tomatoes increases the absorption of lycopene, a vitamin A antioxidant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Legumes like beans and lentils are virtually impossible to digest without cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Digestibility**: Cooking pre-digests food outside the body, making it easier for the digestive system to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Boiling tough meats, for example, makes them more tender and releases nutrients into broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Food Safety**: Cooking kills bacteria that cause food poisoning, which is a major cause of illness globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This is particularly crucial in regions with less sterile food and water supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Some raw food advocates seek reduced bioavailability, hoping to absorb fewer calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. While this might lead to weight loss by limiting food choices and reducing junk food intake, relying on passing perfectly good food without using it is deemed illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## The Paleo Diet

The paleo diet restricts grains, legumes, and dairy, asserting that these foods were not consumed by Stone Age ancestors and humans are not "meant" to eat them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

However, archaeological evidence contradicts this claim:
*   **Grain Consumption**: Humans consumed grains deep in the Paleolithic era, long before the first agricultural revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Modern Vegetables**: Many vegetables popular in the paleo diet today are modern creations, resulting from millennia of selective breeding by humans, and did not exist in the Stone Age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Similar to the raw diet, any benefits derived from the paleo diet often stem from the elimination of excessive calories from refined carbohydrates, a common issue in affluent societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## The Ketogenic (Keto) Diet

The modern [[low_carb_dieting_strategies | ketogenic diet]], another [[low_carb_dieting_strategies | low carb diet]] that restricts starch and sugar, was originally developed in the early 20th century as a preventive treatment for seizures, particularly in children with epilepsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. It forces the body to produce ketone bodies from fat to be used by the brain instead of glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

While it has gained popularity for weight loss, there are significant [[issues_with_the_keto_diet_and_misconceptions | issues with the keto diet and misconceptions]]:
*   **Extreme Ratio**: Few individuals who believe they are "doing keto" actually adhere to the extreme fat-to-carb ratio required to induce true ketosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. An actual keto diet for a child with epilepsy might involve consuming heavy whipping cream with every meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Adherence**: It is very challenging for most people to stick to a true ketogenic diet for more than three to six months, as carbohydrates like bread and pasta are often reintroduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. True ketosis requires consuming about 50 grams of carbohydrates or less per day, which is a very small amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

Ultimately, many nutrition experts agree that the primary dietary problem in Western societies is not home-baked bread or fresh pasta, but rather processed foods, sugary items, and fast food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Any diet plan that eliminates these highly processed items is likely to be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

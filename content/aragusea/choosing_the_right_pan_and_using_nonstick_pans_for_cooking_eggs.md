Mastering the art of cooking eggs begins with understanding the right tools and techniques for various styles, including sunny side up, crispy, basted, over easy, scrambled, and omelets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This guide focuses on pan selection, particularly nonstick, and how it influences your results.

## The Essential Nonstick Pan

For cooking eggs, a nonstick pan is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While fried eggs existed before Teflon's invention in 1938, using other types of pans is significantly more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For advanced techniques, other pans can be explored, but a nonstick pan simplifies the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Why Nonstick?

A good nonstick pan allows you to use no fat at all when cooking eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. However, most people still add some fat as it enhances the flavor and helps prevent sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Recommended Cookware: Misen Nonstick Pan

Misen nonstick pans are highly durable, featuring three distinct layers of nonstick coating bonded to a plasma primer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This construction is designed to last two and a half times longer than traditional nonstick pans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. They are notably heavy and solid, offering excellent build quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The comfortable rubber handle can be removed, allowing the pan to be used in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Misen pans are recommended for beginners seeking quality cookware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. While eggs can be cooked in carbon steel or stainless steel pans with practice, Misen offers reliable options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Using Fat and Controlling Heat

The type of fat used and the heat level are crucial for different egg preparations.

### Butter vs. Oil

Butter is often preferred over oil for its flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Additionally, butter provides valuable sensory clues about the pan's temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. For crispy eggs, oil is generally better as the milk solids in butter can burn at higher temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Extra virgin olive oil or even chicken fat can be used for basting eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Reading the Butter for Heat Control

Understanding how butter reacts in the pan helps control the heat:
*   **Melts smoothly:** The pan is not hot enough, unless you're aiming for a very soft, pure white egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Foams gently:** This is an ideal starting temperature for most eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. On one stove, this is just below medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Browns:** The pan is quite hot for eggs, suitable for specific results like crispy eggs, but not for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Pan Techniques for Different Egg Styles

### Sunny Side Up Eggs

*   **Evenly Cooked (Steamed Top):** Start with butter at a gentle foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Sprinkle salt on top while the white is still liquid for even seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid (or foil as a substitute) to trap steam, cooking the top of the egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The yolk will become cloudy after a few minutes, indicating it's warmed through but still soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Soft, Pure White Bottom:** Use very low heat, where the butter barely foams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The white should set without bubbling or "fluttering" around the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Cover the pan to steam the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This method takes longer (around 8 minutes) but yields a soft, custardy white that is easy to cut with a fork, and a warm, runny yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Crispy Egg:** Use oil instead of butter at medium heat, increasing if needed, to achieve a "skirt" of white that flutters and bubbles with steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Be cautious as hot oil may spit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The high heat will cook the yolk from below, making it cloudy even without covering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The bottom will be very firm and crispy, like a potato chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Lift out with a spatula to leave excess oil behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Basted Egg:** Use a little more oil than usual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Cook the egg as desired (e.g., with no fluttering for a soft white bottom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Instead of covering, spoon hot oil over the top, tilting the pan to pool the oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This provides more control, allowing you to cook specific areas and resulting in a brighter, less cloudy yolk compared to steaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Even with metal utensils on a nonstick pan, a rounded spoon belly is unlikely to cause damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Be prepared to quickly lift the egg out of the oil when done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Eggs Over Easy

This method is considered a superior way to cook a whole, unbroken egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Start with gently foaming butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Cook the white until it's pretty solid (around two and a half minutes), with the inner ring just starting to set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Slide the egg to the pan's edge for an easier flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Flipping too high can break the yolk, while flipping too gently might not fully turn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. For a runny yolk, cook for about 30 seconds on the second side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. While the first flip should ideally be done without a spatula for a delicate white, once it's solid, a spatula can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Eggs cooked from both sides, like over easy or scrambled, are more time-sensitive and should be removed from the pan as soon as they reach desired doneness, or even slightly before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Scrambled Eggs

For fluffy scrambled eggs, use more fat in the pan and slightly higher heat (a "not so gentle foam") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The goal is to create steam for fluffy curds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Begin by stirring constantly as if starting an omelet until the mixture just sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Then, "destroy" the omelet by scraping the egg off the bottom to form big, fluffy ribbons or sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Scrambled eggs are very time-sensitive because they cook intensely from all sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. American-style scrambled eggs have a different texture than French-style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Omelets (American Diner Style)

Even with a nonstick pan, an omelet requires a generous amount of butter, applied up the sides of the pan where the egg will reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. For an American diner-style omelet, use aggressive foam from the butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Beat the eggs very smoothly to loosen the protein structure, allowing them to flow into a solid, thin sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Stir constantly until the mixture stops flowing into its own gaps, then smush it into an even layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Add fillings quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The heat should be turned off when the eggs are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Fold the omelet while the top is still a little gooey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The traditional tri-fold shape offers two chances to get the fold right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. As with scrambled eggs, omelets cooked from all sides need to be removed from the pan slightly before they reach desired doneness to prevent overcooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

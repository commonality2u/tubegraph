Making a delicious chicken soup involves careful seasoning throughout the cooking process and optional additions at the end.

## Initial Seasoning and Stock Flavoring
When preparing the stock, you can add basic aromatic vegetables for flavor. Even shriveled half an onion can be thrown in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. However, it's generally advised not to waste "good stuff" on the initial stock phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

For the liquid, using filtered water is suggested for better taste, though the perceived difference with tap water might be subtle in the finished soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Starting stock with cool water, as culinary schools advise, can result in a slightly less cloudy stock, though it doesn't make a significant difference in taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Vegetable Additions for Flavor
A variety of vegetables contribute to the soup's flavor and texture. Zucchini can add mucilage, thickening the soup slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, with okra doing an even better job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Common vegetables used include:
*   Celery: Leaves and core can be saved for garnish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Onions: Can be cut into half-moons for a pretty, slurpable texture or diced fine for flavor without much texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   Garlic: Smashing cloves to release the skin and chopping them adds significant flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   Carrots: Can be peeled or scrubbed and sliced into rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Parsnips: Especially when large, they should be peeled and can be quartered before slicing, offering a strong herbal note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

It is generally advised to use a lot of vegetables, at least as much raw weight of vegetables as chicken, as the meat stock enhances their taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Mid-Cooking Seasoning
Once vegetables are added, start with a couple of big pinches of salt so the pieces can absorb some [[use_of_spices_and_seasonings_in_cooking | seasoning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Be conservative, as more salt can always be added to taste at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

After the vegetables have simmered and softened for about half an hour, taste for [[use_of_spices_and_seasonings_in_cooking | seasoning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   Add more salt as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. A significant amount of salt might be needed for a dozen portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   Add plenty of pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   Turmeric can be added for a subtle flavor and to give the soup a beautiful golden yellow color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Many pre-packaged chicken soups and stocks also use turmeric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## Finishing Touches
At the last minute, fresh herbs can be added to the pot, such as saved celery leaves or parsley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Alternatively, herbs can be added directly to the bowl to maintain a greener color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

For a bright finish, a squeeze of lemon juice or a drop of vinegar can be added directly to individual bowls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, as this keeps the flavor fresher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Customization
This approach focuses on a simply flavored Euro-American style soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. However, the soup can be adapted with other spices and ingredients like lemongrass, ginger, chili, and fish sauce for different flavor profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

Making homemade marshmallows is worthwhile for their amazing texture and flavor, and the process is best started the night before you plan to serve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Preparation

To begin, prepare your vessel by greasing it and coating the bottom and insides with an ample pile of powdered sugar, ensuring it's thoroughly coated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This step is crucial for easily removing the sticky marshmallow later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. You can use any square vessel, such as a loaf pan for a smaller batch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. After coating, dump out any excess sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Next, gather your equipment: a small saucepan, a mixing bowl, and have an electric hand mixer plugged in and ready, as the process moves quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Ingredients & Cooking Process

### Sugar Syrup

Combine 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of water in the saucepan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Then, add approximately 1/4 cup of honey; measuring is difficult due to its stickiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The honey will impart a strong flavor, so if you prefer a less intense honey taste, use corn syrup instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. An inverted sugar (like honey or corn syrup) is necessary to prevent the other sugar from crystallizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Heat the mixture on high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. As the sugars heat, they will become less viscous, allowing you to mix them by shaking the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Bring the syrup to a boil, which will happen very fast, within five minutes maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Cook the syrup to the soft ball stage, which is around 240°F (115°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Pushing it a few extra degrees can result in firmer marshmallows, which are preferred for [[hot_chocolate_recipe | hot chocolate]] as they don't melt instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Gelatin Preparation

While the syrup heats, pour a 1/4 ounce envelope of unflavored gelatin into your mixing bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For a vegan alternative, use two teaspoons of agar-agar powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Mix in 1/4 cup of water and let it hydrate for about a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This recipe uses a proportionally high amount of gelatin for firm marshmallows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Combining and Beating

Once the syrup is ready, carefully drizzle it into the bloomed gelatin while continuously beating with the hand mixer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Be cautious as hot syrup is dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Continue beating for about three to four minutes until the mixture becomes fluffy and white, with the beaters leaving trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The marshmallow is ready when it's cool enough to touch but still warm enough to pour easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Stop mixing while it's still very warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Add a small drop of vanilla extract at this stage; adding it while the syrup is piping hot might cause some flavor to evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Setting and Finishing

Quickly pour the marshmallow into the prepared powdered pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. A silicon spatula is the best tool to nudge it into an even layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. If you wait too long, the marshmallow will set up hard in the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

To enhance the flavor beyond just fluffy sugar, you can brûlée the surface with a kitchen torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This, combined with the honey, gives the marshmallows a strong flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Place the marshmallow in the fridge uncovered for at least a few hours, or ideally overnight, to allow it to dry out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Cutting and Dusting

Marshmallow is incredibly sticky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. To work with it, you need to use a significant amount of powdered sugar (which contains cornstarch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Dust your hands thoroughly before peeling the marshmallow out of the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

To cut, grease your knife and then coat it with powdered sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Cut the marshmallow into long strips, then toss these strips in the sugar to coat the cut sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Finally, cut the strips into small squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. You will need to tear the individual squares apart and ensure each is coated in sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

This small batch makes more than enough marshmallows for four portions of [[hot_chocolate_recipe | hot chocolate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Serving Ideas

Small, bite-sized marshmallow squares are ideal for [[hot_chocolate_recipe | hot chocolate]] as they can be easily slurped out of the drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. While larger marshmallows might be more photogenic, they are harder to eat without waiting for them to melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

For a compromise between size and eatability, you can cut a wide, thin round from an unbrûléed part of the marshmallow sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Float this on top of your [[hot_chocolate_recipe | hot chocolate]] and then hit it with a torch for a freshly brûléed, crispy, filo-like texture on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This makes it look prettier and can still be slurped or allowed to melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

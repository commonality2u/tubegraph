Many pasta dishes have specific traditional preparations, but modern and non-traditional methods can offer unique flavors or ease of cooking. One example is [[Spaghetti allassassina preparation | Spaghetti all'assassina]], a dish from Bari in southeast Italy, which is distinctive because it is more fried than boiled, unlike most pasta dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Garnish Choices

Traditionally, the sauce for Spaghetti all'assassina often includes dried red chili flakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. However, a [[nontraditional cooking methods | non-traditional garnish]] of charred pickled chilies, such as serrano chilies, can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Thick-sliced jalapenos can also be added to the sauce to provide noticeable vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Tomato Sauce Preparation

For the sauce base in Spaghetti all'assassina, the traditional approach involves diluting a tomato product into a "tomato broth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Starting with whole fresh tomatoes, like grape or cherry tomatoes, is ideal for the sauce, as it retains some bright freshness even after thorough cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Alternatively, if a food processor is unavailable, canned tomato puree can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. A jar or can of pre-made tomato sauce can also be watered down, typically two parts water to one part sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Pan Selection

The traditional pan for Spaghetti all'assassina is a big, well-seasoned cast iron pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. However, a non-stick (Teflon) pan is suggested as a superior modern alternative, being "a hundred times easier" to use and yielding better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. In contrast, a stainless steel pan is considered impossible for this dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, as the brown bits that form would stick to the bottom, whereas with Teflon, they stay on the noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## Pasta Choice

For [[Spaghetti allassassina preparation | Spaghetti all'assassina]], using a cheaper pasta with a smooth, shiny surface is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Fancy bronze-cut pasta with a rough surface sheds too much starch in this specific dish, which can result in a pasty sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Cooking Method

The dish involves laying dry pasta directly into a pan with a thin layer of tomato broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The pasta is cooked by allowing the liquid to evaporate, letting the bottom layer of spaghetti brown, then adding more broth in stages, similar to how risotto is traditionally made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. While some traditional recipes suggest burning the bottom layer, deep browning is typically preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This method results in a pasta that tastes different because the flavor of the sauce permeates the entire noodle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, and the sauce develops a velvety texture similar to risotto due to starch release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

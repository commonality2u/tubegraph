This article details an involved approach to preparing a holiday turkey, focusing on deboning the bird before roasting. This method is designed to simplify the cooking process on the day of the feast and results in a turkey that is easy to slice and serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Overview and Timeline

Unlike a [[thanksgiving_turkey_preparation | simple roast turkey with gravy]], this method involves significant advanced preparation, making the final cooking on the holiday much less stressful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The hard work is completed in advance, allowing you to simply place a pan in the oven on the day of your big holiday feast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Slicing the boneless meat is significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

It is recommended to start this process two days before the feast, though it can be started the day prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This method can be applied to any size bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## [[deboning_a_turkey | Deboning a Turkey]]

### Tools and Setup
You will need kitchen scissors and a boning knife, or any sharp knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The deboning process can be done directly on a clean counter, as any spills are inevitable regardless of using a cutting board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Process
1.  **Locate the Backbone**: Flip the turkey so the backbone is facing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
2.  **Initial Cuts**: Cut straight down along one side of the spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
3.  **Peeling Meat**: Allow your knife to follow the bones, slowly peeling the meat off the central skeleton. Most meat sits on top of the bones, making it relatively easy to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
4.  **Addressing Joints**:
    *   **Hip and Shoulder Joints**: These are the four points where the skeleton protrudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Use kitchen scissors to get around the joint, grip down, and twist hard to dislocate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Once dislocated, snip away at ligaments and connecting tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   **Wing/Shoulder Joint**: On a large turkey, this joint is small enough to dislocate by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Once loose, use a knife to cut through remaining tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
5.  **Removing Breast Meat**: Continue peeling meat off the ribs, stopping when you reach the sternum (breastbone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Once one side is free, rotate the bird to work on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
6.  **Freeing the Carcass**: Peel the meat off the sternum and break off the wishbone to free the central skeleton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Save the carcass, neck, and giblets for gravy or demi-glace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
7.  **Deboning Legs and Thighs**:
    *   Cut down to the thigh bone, peel meat off the sides, and slip your knife underneath to saw out towards where the hip was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   Repeat the process for the knee and shin bone (tibia), peeling meat to expose the bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
    *   Lever the bones over at the ankle and snip with scissors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   **Removing Tendons**: Large turkeys have tough tendons in the legs that make the meat inedible. Use pliers to grab the end of the tendon, hold the meat back, and pull hard to extract them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Save these for sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
8.  **Deboning Wings**: You can cut wings off whole and add them to the sauce, as there isn't much meat on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. For the upper portion (drumette), cut down along the humerus and peel meat off the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The winglets and wing tip can be cut off whole for the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
9.  **Trimming and Preparing Meat**:
    *   Trim any remaining cartilage or excess fatty globs to ensure the final roast is 100% edible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. These trimmings are excellent for sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   Flip back the pectoralis minor muscles (tenderloins) to create a more even thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   Butterfly the thickest part of the breast with shallow cuts to help it lie flatter and cook more evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Seasoning and Curing

1.  **Salt Cure (Dry Brine)**: With the turkey flayed open, it's easy to apply a salt cure or dry brine. Use the normal amount of salt you would use to flavor the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
2.  **Additional Seasonings**: Apply pepper, dried thyme, sage, garlic powder, and onion powder to the underside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. On the skin side, use salt, pepper, and herbs, but avoid garlic or onion powder as they can burn under dry heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
3.  **Separate Meat**: For a 20-pound bird, the deboned turkey will be too large for one baking tray. Cut it in half, separating the leg quarters from the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This allows for independent control during cooking, as dark meat and white meat cook differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
4.  **Skin Preparation**: Tuck any exposed meat under the skin to prevent it from becoming leathery in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Leave the skin uncovered in the fridge to dry out, which helps it become crispy and delicious, similar to the process for Peking duck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Store raw meat at the bottom of the fridge to prevent leaks onto other food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## [[making_turkey_demiglace | Making Turkey Demi-Glace]]

This rich sauce is made from the turkey bones and trimmings.

1.  **Roasting Bones**: Place the bones, neck, skin, and trimmings in a roasting tray with halved onions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Roast at 400°F (200°C) to develop brown flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
2.  **Adding Flavor Boosters**: After about half an hour, add a little tomato paste and flip the pieces. Tomato paste boosts umami and darkens the color without making the sauce tomatoey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Be careful not to let anything burn, as concentrated flavors will highlight any burnt notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
3.  **Simmering for Stock**:
    *   Transfer the roasted bones to a large stock pot or simmer directly in the roasting tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
    *   Add cold, filtered water (cold water helps extract albumin protein, though the difference might not be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>).
    *   Optionally, add dried porcini mushrooms for an umami boost, whole peppercorns, and bay leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
    *   Bring to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Cover with foil if no lid is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    *   Simmer for several hours, topping off water as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. For demi-glace, collagen must dissolve into gelatin, which takes a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Simmer for about 16 hours, ideally overnight on very low heat to prevent evaporation and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
4.  **Straining and Reducing**:
    *   Remove most solids from the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
    *   Bring the liquid to a boil and reduce by about a third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
    *   Optional: Add a packet of unflavored gelatin for more sauce volume and desired texture without excessive reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Ensure powder dissolves completely by boiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
    *   Pass the liquid through a sieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
5.  **Cooling and Skimming Fat**:
    *   Rapidly cool the stock to prevent microbial growth. Use a smaller bowl nested in a larger bowl filled with ice water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
    *   Stop boiling before the stock gets too thick, as thickness can cause it to stick to solids and prevent clean fat separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
    *   Once chilled, the fat will rise and solidify (or remain somewhat liquid if low in saturated fat). The stock underneath should be a firm block of jello <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Scrape the fat off the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This fat can be saved for other uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
6.  **Final Reduction to Demi-Glace**:
    *   Transfer the gelatinous stock to a wide pan. Bring to a boil and concentrate until syrupy, forming a meat glaze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. A concentrated glaze cannot hold fat without emulsifying help, hence the need to remove fat beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    *   Stir constantly once it starts to get syrupy to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
    *   Optionally, add white wine for brightness and floral notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Be cautious of burning due to sugar content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
    *   A gelatin-thickened sauce will be thicker at eating temperature, so assess consistency with the heat off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
    *   Season with salt to taste, as the stock typically contains no added salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
    *   The finished demi-glace will be very glossy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Scrape into a bowl, chill, and reheat on the day of the feast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
    *   **Finishing with Butter**: To increase sauce volume or enhance flavor, melt in a bunch of butter over very low heat, ensuring it doesn't bubble, to maintain the butter's emulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This adds flavor and changes the texture to be warmer or fluffier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Re-season if using unsalted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

## [[roasting_techniques_for_turkey | Roasting the Deboned Turkey]]

1.  **Preparation for Roasting**: On the day of the feast, pull the trays of deboned turkey from the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. After 48 hours, the skin should be very dry, and most salt absorbed into the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
2.  **Oven Temperature**: Roast at 400°F (200°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
3.  **Basting**: Basting once or twice will add flavor but slightly reduce final crispiness due to the water content in basting juices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. For maximum crispy skin, rub the skin with oil before roasting and do not baste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
4.  **Cooking Time**: Off the bone, a turkey cooks significantly faster. A deboned turkey can be done in just over an hour, compared to five hours or more for a bone-in turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
5.  **Internal Temperature**:
    *   **Dark Meat**: Preferred internal temperature is 185°F (85°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Dark meat generally cooks faster off the bone due to smaller pieces and increased surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
    *   **White Meat**: Do not exceed 160°F (71°C), as carryover heat will increase the temperature further to the minimum safe range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
6.  **Color**: If more color is desired, increase the oven heat at the very end of cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## [[carving_and_serving_turkey | Carving and Serving]] and Advantages

This method yields enough meat for at least a dozen people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. The demi-glace is more intense than traditional [[making_turkey_gravy | gravy]], so less is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

### Key Benefits
*   **Easy Slicing**: The greatest advantage is the ease of [[carving_and_serving_turkey | slicing up boneless meat]]. There are no bones or inedible parts to work around, making it significantly less stressful on the holiday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Crispy Skin**: The salt cure and air drying produce incredibly crisp and tasty skin on both white and dark meat. The dark meat skin, often soggy in conventional roasting, becomes crisp because it was not submerged in juices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Fully Edible Slices**: Because tendons are removed from the legs, every slice of dark meat is clean and completely edible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   **Reduced Holiday Stress**: By completing the deboning and demi-glace preparation in advance, you have more time and mental space on the day of the feast to focus on side dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

## Considerations for Saltiness and Brining

While this method uses a dry brine, the creator expresses a personal preference against brined poultry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   **Wet Brine**: Can give meat the texture of cheap bologna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **Dry Brine**: Can make the texture a little too firm and the uniform saltiness can drown out the subtle flavor of turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

The preference is for the sauce to bring the salt, and for the turkey to be seasoned conventionally right before roasting (perhaps salting the skin a little to help it dry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. However, many people enjoy [[roasting_techniques_for_turkey | poultry brines]], so individual preference should guide this decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

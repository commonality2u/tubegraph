When preparing a [[classic_grilled_cheese_sandwich_ingredients_and_preparation | classic grilled cheese sandwich]], the choice of spread for the bread can significantly impact the final texture and flavor. While [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] is traditionally used, mayonnaise has emerged as an alternative.

## Butter Method

The classic approach involves slathering a large quantity of softened [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] onto both slices of sandwich bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, specifically an "obscene amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Preparation**: [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | Butter]] should be at room temperature or quickly softened in a microwave for 10-20 seconds on low power, flipped once, to be easily spreadable but not melted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Cooking Effects**: When the [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]]-coated bread hits the pan, the outer layer of the [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] toasts the bread brown and crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Simultaneously, the inner layer melts into the interior of the bread, where it remains sweet and does not brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Flavor Profile**: Many prefer the flavor of [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]], finding it superior to mayonnaise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The "fresh sweet [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] taste" up inside the bread, complementing the brown crust, is a key characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Alternative Application**: While some might melt a ton of [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] directly into the pan and then drop a dry sandwich into it, this method can lead to more wasted [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] and heavier browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Mayonnaise Method

Using mayonnaise instead of [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] to slather on the bread for a grilled cheese sandwich is a technique some people advocate for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Convenience**: Mayonnaise is more convenient as it does not require warming up before use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Crust**: It tends to result in a crispier crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This might be due to its lower water content compared to [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] or the egg protein it contains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Flavor Profile**: The flavor of mayonnaise is often considered inferior to [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] for grilled cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   If grilled on low heat until just golden, the mayonnaise flavor can be almost imperceptible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   If grilled until dark, it can develop an "awful fishy flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, which has been likened to "tuna salad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: If trying the mayonnaise method, it is advised not to cook it as brown as one might with the [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Ultimately, the choice between [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | butter]] and mayonnaise for grilled cheese comes down to personal preference for flavor and texture.

This article outlines a basic yet effective [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | recipe]] for a foolproof [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | pancake batter]], providing insights into how to prepare it and what can go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Recommended Tools

While [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | batter]] can be made in nearly any vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, a large 1-quart Pyrex measuring jug is ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. A fork works well for mixing, though a [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | whisk]] can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Batter Preparation Steps

### 1. Melt Butter
Start by melting 2 tablespoons (about 14 grams) of [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | butter]] in the measuring jug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This step ensures the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | pancakes]] are moist and flavorful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Microwave the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | butter]] for about 30 seconds until it's not quite all melted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. If the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | butter]] is too hot, it could curdle the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | egg]] later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Swish the partially melted [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | butter]] around to melt the rest, which helps to cool it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### 2. Add Sugar
Next, add 2 tablespoons (about 25 grams) of [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | sugar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | sugar]] helps to lower the temperature further before the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | egg]] is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While not super sweet, it enhances browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### 3. Incorporate Egg and Vanilla
Crack in one whole [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | egg]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Add a couple of teaspoons of [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | vanilla]] extract, eyeballing the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Beat the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | egg]] thoroughly into the mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This ensures the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | egg]] is liquefied and the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | butter]] is emulsified before cold [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | milk]] is added, preventing the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | butter]] from solidifying badly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### 4. Add Milk and Salt
Pour in about 1.5 to 1.75 cups (around 400 ml) of [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | milk]], aiming for two full cups of total liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The proportions do not need to be precise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Add a teaspoon (about 6 grams) of kosher [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | salt]]; you might want more if using unsalted [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | butter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### 5. Add Leavening and Flour
You need a lot of [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | baking powder]] to make fluffy [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | pancakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Use a heaped tablespoon (about 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon or 16 grams) of [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | baking powder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

The [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | flour]] is the most variable component, depending on your preferred [[variations_and_tips_for_cooking_pancakes | pancake thickness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Start with about 1.5 cups (200 grams) of all-purpose [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | flour]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### 6. Mix and Rest the Batter
It is essential to not overmix [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | pancake batter]] once the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | flour]] goes in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Barely mix it; the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | batter]] should still contain small lumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Overmixing makes [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | pancakes]] tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The lumps will cook out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. More [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | flour]] results in thicker [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | batter]] and thicker [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | pancakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

After mixing, allow the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | batter]] to rest for a few minutes so the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | flour]] can hydrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | batter]] will thicken as it sits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. If it becomes too thick, you can loosen it with a little more [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | milk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## [[variations_and_tips_for_cooking_pancakes | Variations and Tips]]

### Half-Batch for Smaller Servings
When making a half batch of [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | batter]], use only the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | egg]] yolk, discarding the white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | batter]] is built around a fixed [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | egg]] quantity, and keeping the [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | egg]] content proportionally low is important as too much [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | egg]] can make [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | pancakes]] tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Using just the yolk can make [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | pancakes]] even better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Buttermilk Pancakes
For [[variations_and_tips_for_cooking_pancakes | buttermilk]] [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | pancakes]], substitute [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | milk]] with real [[variations_and_tips_for_cooking_pancakes | buttermilk]], which has a milky yogurt consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The lactic acid in [[variations_and_tips_for_cooking_pancakes | buttermilk]] provides the necessary acid for leavening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Therefore, you cannot use [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | baking powder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Instead, use [[ingredients_and_tools_for_pancakes | baking soda]] (sodium bicarb) to balance the acid and create bubbles; typically, one teaspoon maximum is enough to neutralize the [[variations_and_tips_for_cooking_pancakes | buttermilk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

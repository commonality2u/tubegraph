Pizza bread is a simple yet delightful dish, often referred to as "pizza bread" by children due to its straightforward nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. It works best when made with [[aging_pizza_dough | pizza dough that has been aged]] in the refrigerator for approximately a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Dough Preparation and Handling

The recommended [[pizza_dough_preparation | pizza dough preparation]] involves kneading the dough, portioning it into individual oiled containers, and placing it directly into the fridge for a [[pizza_dough_preparation_and_cold_rise_method | cold fermentation]] period of several days to a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This method allows the dough to cold ferment, resulting in a desirable texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

When ready to use, gently pull the dough away from the edges of its container to lift it out, aiming to deflate it as little as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Shaping and Seasoning

Once out of the container, turn the dough over so the underside, which often has a rougher, more bubbly surface, is facing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Wipe this surface down with olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Seasonings can be customized, but a suggested combination includes:
*   Black pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>
*   Garlic powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
*   Large, crunchy salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>

## Baking Instructions

1.  **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to its maximum temperature for about half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
2.  **Place Dough**: Gently drop the seasoned dough directly onto a preheated pizza steel or stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Do not use a peel, as the olive oil will cause the dough to stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
3.  **Bake Time**: Bake for approximately seven minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
4.  **Broiler Use**: If the top is not browning sufficiently, you may need to turn on the broiler (the heat from above) midway through baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Be careful not to burn the garlic powder, as it burns easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
5.  **Remove**: A metal tool may be needed to scrape the cooked bread off the steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Baking on a pizza steel or stone is crucial for achieving a crispy base; a regular baking sheet will not produce the same result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Final Product

The resulting pizza bread should have a glassy, crispy top and a satisfyingly crispy base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Oven performance can vary significantly, influencing the exact outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This simple creation consistently pleases both children and adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

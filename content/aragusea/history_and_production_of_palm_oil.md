Palm oil is the most consumed plant oil globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It is an edible grease derived from the fruit of the oil palm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This versatile fat is found in dozens of products, including processed foods, soaps, cosmetics, and biofuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The modern ubiquity and impact of palm oil are explored in Jocelyn Zuckerman's book, "Planet Palm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Production and Types of Palm Oil

Two distinct types of oil can be extracted from the oil palm fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>:
*   **Palm Oil:** Obtained by crushing the meat of the fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This is primarily used in food products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Palm Kernel Oil:** Produced by crushing the kernel (seed) inside the fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This type is mostly used in cosmetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Characteristics and Properties

In its relatively unrefined form, palm oil has a strong, bitter, very vegetal taste and an aroma similar to a spice drawer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Its orange color comes from carotenoids, the same compounds found in carrots and tomatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, the palm oil used in processed foods is often treated to be tasteless, odorless, and colorless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

A key characteristic of palm oil is its high saturated fat content, making it semi-solid at room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Palm oil is 50% saturated fat, while palm kernel oil is even more saturated at about 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This high saturation makes palm oils behave more like animal fats, remaining solid or semi-solid at room temperature and being less prone to oxidation or rancidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This stability is a significant advantage over unsaturated oils like cottonseed oil, which go bad quickly and are liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## History and Rise to Prominence

### Traditional Use in West Africa
The oil palm is native to West Africa, where it has been used as a [[role_of_oil_in_cooking | cooking oil]] for thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Industrial Revolution and Early Applications
During the Second Industrial Revolution, palm oil became essential for manufacturing soaps, particularly as factory workers needed to clean themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. It was also used in lighting lamps and eventually in margarines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Replacing Hydrogenated Fats
Before palm oil's widespread use, industrialists figured out how to add hydrogen atoms to unsaturated fats to make them more viscous and shelf-stable, resulting in products like Crisco (crystallized cottonseed oil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This process, however, often created trans fats, which are now considered very unhealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Palm oil, being naturally saturated, does not require such industrial processing, making it a desirable alternative for food manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The major push to eliminate trans fats significantly contributed to palm oil's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Geographic Expansion and Economic Factors
Most of today's palm oil originates from Malaysia and Indonesia, where the oil palm grows best within 10 degrees north and south of the equator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Colonial Roots:** European rubber plantations in Southeast Asia began shifting to oil palm when synthetic rubber affected their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Post-Independence Schemes:** After gaining independence, governments used oil palm cultivation as a poverty alleviation scheme, providing land and seedlings to poor citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Productivity:** The oil palm's "insane" yield per acre makes it far more productive than any other oil crop, contributing to its low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Palm oil is extremely cheap due to its high productivity and historical factors, including [[labor_issues_in_the_palm_oil_industry | slave labor]] and [[consumer_challenges_and_sustainable_alternatives_for_palm_oil | stolen land]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

        The infrastructure established for the slave trade was repurposed for palm oil sourcing after the trade was outlawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. British traders used the same canoes and river routes in the Niger Delta to transport palm oil that were previously used to shuttle human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Concerns

While not the main focus of this article, the rapid expansion of the palm oil industry has led to significant [[environmental_impacts_of_palm_oil_production | deforestation of tropical rainforests]], contributing to global warming and devastating habitats for species like orangutans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Additionally, the industry is plagued by [[labor_issues_in_the_palm_oil_industry | human rights abuses]], including forced labor and exploitation, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. There are also [[health_implications_of_palm_oil_consumption | health concerns]] and challenges for consumers seeking sustainable alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Global Consumption
India is currently the largest consumer of palm oil, utilizing it widely as a [[role_of_oil_in_cooking | cooking oil]] and in snacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Despite a stigma associated with palm oil due to perceived health issues and it not being domestically grown, it is heavily used by street vendors and shops due to its lower cost compared to other oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

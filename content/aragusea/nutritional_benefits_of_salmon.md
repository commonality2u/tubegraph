Salmon is a highly forgiving fish to cook, partly due to its high fat content, which helps it remain moist even when overcooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This fat content plays a significant role in its [[nutritional_benefits_of_cooking_food | nutritional benefits]].

## Omega Fatty Acids

Both [[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | farmed]] and [[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | wild salmon]] contain a mixture of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. For individuals consuming a standard Western diet, it is generally recommended to increase omega-3 intake and reduce omega-6 intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

[[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | Wild salmon]] is considered superior in its fat composition as it offers a more favorable omega-3 to omega-6 ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. In contrast, [[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | farmed salmon]] typically has a higher proportion of omega-6 fatty acids, which may make it a less healthy option for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Astaxanthin

The distinctive reddish color of salmon flesh is due to a pigment called astaxanthin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. [[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | Wild salmon]] acquires astaxanthin naturally from the crustaceans it consumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. [[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | Farmed salmon]], however, would naturally have gray flesh without the addition of astaxanthin as a feed additive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This pigment is noted for its potential health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

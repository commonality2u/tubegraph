A rich and flavorful gravy is a cornerstone of [[thanksgiving_turkey_preparation | Thanksgiving turkey preparation]], and this method focuses on efficiency and maximizing flavor from the roasting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The goal is to achieve a gravy that is rich and flavorful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Foundation of Flavor

The gravy foundation begins directly in the turkey roasting tray, ensuring all valuable juices are utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

*   **Giblets and Neck**: The gizzard, heart, and neck can be placed on the bottom of the roasting tray to flavor the gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Aromatics**: Use aromatic vegetables that are a little "long in the tooth," such as old carrots, celery, and white onions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Onions should be cut in half; smaller chunks risk burning, which would negatively impact the gravy's flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Initial Stovetop Cooking**: Cook the turkey and aromatics on the stovetop over medium heat for at least 15 minutes, or up to half an hour, before placing it in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This step brings heat specifically to the dark meat on the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Ensure nothing burns, as burned flavors will transfer to the gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Roasting Juices**: After the turkey is removed, drain any remaining juices from the cavity back into the pan, as they contribute to the gravy's foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Preparing the Gravy Base

The key to an efficient gravy without extra dishes is to process the pan drippings directly in the roasting tray.

*   **Dry Pan Contents**: Ideally, the contents of the roasting tray should be as dry as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. If you see bubble-like objects, it indicates a lot of juice mixed with the fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Boiling Off Water**: Turn the burner on high to boil off as much water as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. If using one burner, position the tray so the deep liquid is over the heat and drier parts are off the heat to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. When the liquid fizzes more than it boils, most of the water is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Making a Roux**: Reduce the heat to a bare simmer and mix flour directly into the pan to make a roux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This method simplifies gravy making by eliminating the need to skim fat or use a gravy separator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Add enough flour to create a thick paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Browning the roux adds good flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Deglazing**: Once the roux is browned, [[making_turkey_demiglace | deglaze]] the pan by adding stock little by little, integrating it into the thick paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Scraping the Fond**: Focus on scraping the fond (browned bits) off the bottom with a wooden spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. A stainless steel roasting tray is ideal because the color contrast between the fond and the pan makes it easier to see what you're doing, unlike dark nonstick surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Achieving Desired Thickness**: Bring the gravy to a boil to see its true thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Add more stock gradually, ensuring you don't surpass the thickening capacity of your roux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. The gravy should be glossy due to the fat left in and the starch from the flour, which keeps it emulsified and prevents splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Finishing and Serving

*   **Simmering**: Let the gravy sit and simmer for as long as time allows to extract flavor and color from the solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Resting Juices**: Pour the resting juices from the turkey into the gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Straining**: Strain the gravy through a sieve into a big bowl to achieve a smooth, clean consistency, without worrying about flour lumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Gentle smashing helps it all go through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Seasoning**: Taste for seasoning and aim for it to be a little too salty, as its salinity will be diluted by the bland interior meat in most mouthfuls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Serving**: Gravy provides moisture and flavor, serving as an elegant binary system with the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

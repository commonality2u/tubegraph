This mac and cheese recipe, passed down through generations, prioritizes simplicity and a smooth texture over traditional methods. Unlike recipes using a [[comparison_of_traditional_mornay_sauce_and_processed_cheese_sauce | mornay sauce]] with butter and flour roux, this one relies on processed American cheese for its emulsifying properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The result is a much smoother outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The recipe was taught to the creator's father by Grandma Ragusa, who had him making it himself at eight years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This was typically prepared on Fridays, as per Catholic tradition of not eating meat on that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Ingredients

*   1 pound pasta (such as [[pasta_choices_for_mac_and_cheese | large shells]] or desired shape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   1 quart whole milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   1 whole 16-ounce package of Kraft Deli Deluxe American cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
    *   *Note*: This is distinct from Kraft Singles and contains enough real cheddar or Colby cheese to be classified as cheese by the US government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Other types may be labeled as "cheese product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Black pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   ½ to 1 whole stick of butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   Salt (for pasta water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>

## Equipment

*   Large pot for boiling pasta water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Large pan for sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Baking dish (at least 2.5 quarts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

## Instructions

### Preparing the Cheese Sauce

1.  Place a large pan on medium heat and add 1 quart of whole milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
2.  Tear the 16-ounce package of Kraft Deli Deluxe American cheese into pieces and add it to the milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Tearing helps it melt quickly and evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
3.  Add black pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. No additional salt is needed due to the cheese's salt content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
4.  Add between half and a whole stick of butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
5.  Stir continuously as the cheese slowly melts over 5 to 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The sauce should become nice and smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Cooking the Pasta

1.  Bring enough water to a boil for a pound of pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Salt the boiling water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
3.  Add the pound of pasta to the boiling water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
4.  Hard boil the pasta for *exactly* five minutes; any longer and it will become mushy after baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
5.  Drain the pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Assembling and Baking

1.  Lubricate a baking dish of at least 2.5 quarts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
2.  Add the drained pasta to the baking dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
3.  Pour the smooth cheese sauce over the pasta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
4.  Stir the pasta and sauce together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. At this stage, the mixture should appear "too soupy"; if it doesn't, the baked mac and cheese will be dry and gloppy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
5.  **Baking:**
    *   Place the dish in an oven preheated to 350°F (175°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   Bake for 45 minutes, *covered* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Covering helps with more even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. (Alternatively, if you prefer a super dry and crispy top, you can bake uncovered from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.)
    *   After 45 minutes, remove the cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   Bake for another half-hour or so, until the top layer of cheese is browned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. If further browning is desired, use the broiler at the very end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Finishing and Serving

*   Once baked, allow the mac and cheese to rest for about half an hour before serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This resting period is crucial; otherwise, the sauce will run out all over the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   The dish can be served with a salad; the acidic crunch of the salad provides a great contrast to the soft richness of the mac and cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   One reviewer noted that the flavor is stronger and the texture far smoother than mac and cheese made with "real cheese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

> [00:01:07] You could totally add some more herbs and spices at this stage if you wanted.

> [00:01:58] I actually don't cover it because I like the top super dry and crispy but you do you.

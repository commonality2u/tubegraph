When it comes to keeping kitchen knives sharp, two common methods are using pull-through sharpeners and [[basics_of_knife_sharpening_with_whetstones | whetstones]]. While pull-through sharpeners offer convenience, [[basics_of_knife_sharpening_with_whetstones | whetstones]] provide superior results and are the preferred choice for professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Pull-Through Sharpeners

Pull-through sharpeners are designed for ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Many are multi-stage, with a first stage that cuts a new edge and a second stage that refines it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. They can be "good enough for us normals" as long as they are compatible with the basic kind of knife and steel you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Limitations
However, pull-through sharpeners have significant drawbacks:
*   **Mechanism**: They primarily function by "ripping metal across the edge" or "grinding it off mechanically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Heat Generation**: This mechanical process generates heat, which can "detemper" the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Detempering makes the blade prematurely dull or prevents it from achieving a true sharpness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Material Removal**: They tend to remove more steel than necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, which can shorten the lifespan of expensive knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Edge Quality**: The edge produced by pull-through sharpeners can have a "nasty scratch pattern" when viewed under a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

## Whetstones

[[basics_of_knife_sharpening_with_whetstones | Whetstones]], also known as "stones with an H" (from an Old Anglo-Saxon word meaning "to sharpen" or "to get ready" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>), are the method of choice for professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Advantages
The advantages of using [[basics_of_knife_sharpening_with_whetstones | whetstones]] include:
*   **Temperature Control**: A stone remains cool during sharpening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, preventing the blade from detempering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Finer Edge**: Sharpening with a stone results in a finer, cleaner edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Minimal Material Removal**: [[basics_of_knife_sharpening_with_whetstones | Whetstones]] remove less steel than mechanical grinders, preserving the knife's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Total Control**: [[basics_of_knife_sharpening_with_whetstones | Whetstones]] offer total control over the cutting angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. You can create a very narrow, super sharp edge or a wider, tougher edge (like an axe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Versatility**: They can be used for standard Western double-beveled knives and single-beveled Asian-style knives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Professional Preference
Expert sharpeners, like Chef Davis Wells, are often paid by top chefs to sharpen their knives using [[basics_of_knife_sharpening_with_whetstones | whetstones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The meticulous process of sharpening 40 to 60 knives per week with stones can be physically demanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The superior edge from [[basics_of_knife_sharpening_with_whetstones | whetstones]] is crucial for certain tasks:
*   **Onion Cutting**: Sharper knives rupture fewer cell walls, preventing the release of irritants that make you cry when cutting onions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Specialized Cuts**: Different [[types_of_whetstones_and_selecting_the_right_grit | grit]] stones can create specific tooth patterns for different cutting needs: coarser stones for tougher items like tomato skins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, and finer stones for delicate tasks like slicing raw fish for sashimi, which yields a glossy, smooth finish and can even improve the taste of the fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Comparison of Edge Quality

A direct comparison of a knife sharpened by a pull-through sharpener versus a [[basics_of_knife_sharpening_with_whetstones | whetstone]] reveals a significant difference:
*   **Pull-Through**: Under a microscope, the edge sharpened by a pull-through sharpener shows a "nasty scratch pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   **Whetstone**: The edge sharpened on [[basics_of_knife_sharpening_with_whetstones | whetstones]] appears "beautiful and polished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.

This visual difference highlights the superior refinement achieved with [[basics_of_knife_sharpening_with_whetstones | whetstones]], which creates a very fine, clean edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

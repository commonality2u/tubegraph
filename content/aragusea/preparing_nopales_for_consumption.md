[[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | Nopales]], also known as paddles or pads, are the edible outer leaves of the prickly pear cactus (Opuntia genus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. While nearly every part of the prickly pear plant is edible and potentially tasty, there are hazards to consider when preparing it for human consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Identifying and Harvesting Nopales

The best [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | nopales]] for consumption are typically the new growth paddles that sprout in the springtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. These are lighter green and more tender than mature paddles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Hazards: Glochids

A significant hazard when [[eating_cactus_safely | eating cactus safely]] is the presence of glochids, which are nearly microscopic, barbed thorns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. These "hairy little demons" hook into the skin and break off, remaining inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. They can cause minor but sharp pain upon pressure and a generalized dull aching or inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Store-bought [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | nopales]] often have fewer glochids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, but wild ones can be covered in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If you were to simply shave off the large thorns on [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | nopales]], any dislodged glochids could get stuck in the sticky flesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Removing Glochids

A traditional method to remove glochids from [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | nopales]] is to [[eating_cactus_safely | kill them with fire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This can be done over a gas stove flame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a> or a campfire, but be careful not to overheat them, as they will burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The heat causes the glochids to ignite and shrivel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. After flaming, wash the [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | nopales]] off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Texture and Taste

[[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | Nopales]] are filled with mucilage, a gluey polysaccharide that gives them a slimy texture, similar to okra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

*   **Raw**: The slimy texture does not bother some people when eating [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | nopales]] raw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Raw [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | nopales]] have a slightly sour, fruity taste, described as "if green beans were a sour fruit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Harvesting pads in the morning may result in lower acid content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Cooked**: The slime becomes "much more unpleasant" when [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | nopales]] are cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. In Mexican cuisine, [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | nopales]] are often boiled, then strained and washed to reduce the slime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. When well-prepared, they can make a very tasty taco filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

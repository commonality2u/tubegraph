Information regarding specific nontraditional cooking methods is limited within the provided transcript. The dialogue mentions "raw meat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> and the concept of "stew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> which is a [[cooking_techniques|cooking technique]], but does not elaborate on any methods that could be distinctly classified as nontraditional.

An "oven" is also referenced in an unclear context regarding a "department" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The transcript notes that something can be "50 times delicious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, but this is not linked to a specific cooking process. General terms like "food" are mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, and someone states, "I'll eat it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

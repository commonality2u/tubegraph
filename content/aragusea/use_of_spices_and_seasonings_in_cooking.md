Spices and seasonings are crucial for developing the flavor profile of dishes, often contributing to sweetness, tanginess, umami, and overall complexity. This article highlights their use in a Chinese-American restaurant-style garlic sauce, which is incidentally vegan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Aromatic Foundations

Aromatic ingredients like garlic, ginger, and chili form the base of many flavorful sauces.
*   **Garlic**: Essential for a garlic sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Ginger**: A thumb-sized piece, about the same amount as the garlic, is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Slicing ginger across its fibers or "against the grain" makes it easier to chop finely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Chili**: Fresh chili can be added for a slight kick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Preparation**: These ingredients are chopped finely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> and then fried in a little [[role_of_oil_in_cooking | cooking oil]] until soft and slightly golden, but before burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Sauce Components and Flavor Enhancers

A variety of liquid and dry ingredients are combined to create a balanced sauce.
*   **Liquid Base**: One cup (240ml) of water or stock can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In this recipe, the water used for steaming broccoli is repurposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Stock might not significantly impact flavor when many stronger flavors are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Onion Powder**: A teaspoon can be added for extra flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Soy Sauce**: Approximately a quarter cup (60ml) is a definite requirement for this style of sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Vinegar/Mustard**: Chinese garlic sauce recipes often include vinegar, and some call for ground mustard seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Two teaspoons of tangy mustard can substitute these, contributing acidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Umami and Texture Agents**:
    *   **Oyster Sauce**: Traditionally used to provide umami and a gooey texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   **Fish Sauce**: An alternative to oyster sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
    *   **Marmite (Yeast Extract)**: A vegan alternative, a large spoonful provides a "wallop of umami" and a "glossy gelatinous texture" due to its B vitamins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Sweeteners

Sweetness is a key component to balance other flavors in the sauce.
*   **Sugar**: Oyster sauce typically contributes sugar, and additional sugar is often added to garlic sauces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. A tablespoon of white sugar is a starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Molasses**: A "glug" of molasses can be added. It combines with white sugar to create brown sugar, and allows for a higher molasses content than typical brown sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This combination is intended to taste like Chinese food, not gingerbread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Finishing Touches and Balancing Flavors

Certain ingredients are added later to preserve their specific characteristics or to adjust the final taste.
*   **Toasted Sesame Oil**: A teaspoon or two is added for flavor, as it is very strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. It should be added at the end, as frying it at the beginning can cause it to burn and make the sauce bitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Pepper**: Freshly ground pepper can be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Chinese Five Spice**: A dash can be added if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Thickener (Cornstarch)**:
    *   Approximately two tablespoons of cornstarch or any refined starch are mixed into a slurry with cool water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   The starch granules disperse rather than dissolve in the water and will sink if left to sit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   The slurry is drizzled into the simmering sauce while stirring to prevent the formation of "starch globs" or lumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **MSG (Monosodium Glutamate)**: A traditional ingredient to boost umami, or plain salt can be used as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Flavor Adjustment**: The sauce should taste "too sweet, too sour, too salty, too umami" on its own, as it needs to strongly flavor the plain unseasoned rice and broccoli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Adjustments for salt, acid (more mustard/vinegar), or sugar should be made to achieve this strong flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Garnish**: Whole sesame seeds can be sprinkled on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

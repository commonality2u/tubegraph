Stuffed crust pizza involves tucking a ring of cheese into the dough around the edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While seemingly simple, this process can lead to issues like leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A reliable method helps mitigate these [[challenges_of_making_stuffed_crust_pizza | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Dough Preparation for Stuffed Crust

For [[stuffed_crust_pizza_techniques | stuffed crust pizza]], the dough, typically made with a standard recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, benefits from specific adjustments:
*   **Extra Flour** Kneading in a little extra flour results in a slightly sticky, drier dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This drier consistency makes the dough stronger and less prone to tearing and leaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Increased Dough Quantity** Instead of the usual four pizzas from a batch of dough, only three are made. This provides the extra dough needed to wrap the cheese ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **No Olive Oil in Rising Bowl** Avoiding olive oil on the dough ball surface during rising helps achieve a better seal around the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Cold Rise** A two-day cold rise in the fridge is preferred over a two-hour counter rise, as cold dough is easier to work with and tastes better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Selecting and Preparing String Cheese

String cheese is the ideal choice for stuffed crust due to its unique properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:
*   **Protein Structure** String cheese has been processed so its proteins align in long, parallel threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Form** It comes in long coils, and while professionals might use whole coils, individual pieces can be lined up end-to-end to form the ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Thickness Adjustment** For home oven-sized pizzas, string cheese pieces are typically too thick and are cut in half. However, they can be left whole if preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Chilling** The prepared string cheese pieces should be chilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Top Cheese Usage** The whole milk, low moisture version of the preferred string cheese brand is also favored for the pizza's top cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It is considered superior to the block version of the same brand, being drier and sharper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This cheese is cut into pellets and chilled to slow down melting during baking, especially in ovens that don't get hot enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Assembling the Stuffed Crust

When assembling the pizza, it's crucial to ensure a good seal around the cheese:
*   **Dough Preparation on Screen** The cold dough is rolled out directly on the counter without flour dusting to encourage sticking, which prevents it from snapping back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It's then transferred to a pizza screen, positioning it evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Creating Excess Dough** A significant amount of very thin excess dough is needed around the edge to fold over and seal the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This is achieved by rolling out the skirts hanging over the screen, allowing them to stick to the counter to remain stretched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. If an area is short on excess, dough can be torn from elsewhere and grafted on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Cheese Ring Placement** The chilled string cheese pieces are arranged in a ring around the edge of the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Sealing the Cheese** The excess dough is wetted with water and then folded over and crimped onto the cheese ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It's important to fold a lot of excess dough back onto the interior of the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This abundance of dough prevents the cheese ring from leaking into the center of the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> and ensures the dough isn't stretched too tightly, which could cause tearing and leakage through the outer side or bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. After greasing the crust with an herb butter mixture, the dough is pressed hard to seal the cheese ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Baking and Characteristics

Baking on a pizza screen or parchment paper is recommended for stuffed crust pizzas because the prolonged preparation time can cause the dough to stick to a peel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
During baking, the string cheese inside the crust will flatten and release steam, creating a hollow dome above it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This cavity results in a unique croissant-like texture when bitten into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This differs from certain restaurant chains that use special cheese blends designed to hold their shape when heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

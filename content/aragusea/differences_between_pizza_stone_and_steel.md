When baking pizza at home, a hot surface is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:80">[05:11:80]</a>. The choice of baking surface, such as a pizza stone or a pizza steel, significantly impacts the final crust. The narrator recently switched from using a pizza stone to a pizza steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:98">[05:13:98]</a>, noting an evolution in their [[baking_techniques_for_pizza_at_home | technique]] over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Thermal Conductivity and Performance

The primary difference between a pizza stone and a steel lies in their thermal conductivity.
*   **Pizza Steel** is explicitly stated to be "more thermally conductive" than a stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:80">[05:20:80]</a>. This higher conductivity means it transfers heat to the pizza dough more efficiently and quickly.
*   **Pizza Stone** is less thermally conductive in comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:80">[05:20:80]</a>.

## Suitability for Different Ovens

The thermal properties dictate their ideal use:
*   For a **home oven**, which operates at lower temperatures than professional setups, a pizza steel is "perfect" due to its high thermal conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:50">[05:26:50]</a>. The narrator preheats their steel for a full hour at 550°F (on convection roast setting) to achieve a noticeably browner and crispier crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:40">[05:34:40]</a>.
*   For a **wood-fired oven** reaching temperatures of 1000°F, a steel "would be too thermally conductive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:90">[05:22:90]</a>, suggesting that a stone or different material would be more appropriate to prevent overcooking.

## Crust Characteristics

The choice of surface directly affects the browning and crispiness of the crust:
*   With a **pizza steel**, it is possible to achieve "leopard spotting" on the bottom of the crust, similar to what is seen in wood-fired brick ovens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
*   With a **pizza stone** in a home oven, the narrator states they have "never achieved" leopard spotting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:10">[11:20:10]</a>.

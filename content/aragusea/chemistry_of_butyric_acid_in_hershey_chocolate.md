The unique taste profile of Hershey chocolate, which is America's favorite chocolate bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, is often perceived very differently by consumers outside the United States. Many people from other parts of the world describe the [[hershey_chocolate_taste_profile_and_consumer_perception | Hershey chocolate taste profile and consumer perception]] as tasting like vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This distinct flavor is largely attributed to the presence of butyric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

## The Hershey Process and Butyric Acid Formation

The history and science behind this flavor are quite interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. The key to understanding this lies in how milk is incorporated into the chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

Historically, chocolate was a beverage for much of its 4,000-year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Europeans began drinking chocolate for pleasure after adding sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, and at some point, they started adding milk to smooth and thicken the texture and round off bitter flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Solid chocolate products, including milk chocolate, emerged in the 19th century in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Early milk chocolate involved powdered milk, pioneered by Daniel Peter of Nestle, and later condensed milk for a smoother product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

Milton Hershey, an American caramel maker, sought to develop his own milk chocolate process in the early 1900s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. A significant development came in 1903 when Hershey and his factory worker, John Schmalbach, experimented with skim milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Skim milk was preferred because milk fat could go rancid, which was unsuitable for the shelf-stable, mass-produced product Hershey envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

Schmalbach's method involved mixing skim milk with sugar and cooking it in a giant copper vacuum pan at a very low temperature for a long time. After cooking, the mixture was left to sit and cool in the vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This low-temperature reduction process soured the milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

## The Chemistry of "Vomit" Taste

Chocolate experts widely agree that the sour taste in Hershey's chocolate is due to butyric acid, also known as "butter acid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. This acid is created by lipolyzing, or breaking down, the fat content in the milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. One way to produce butyric acid is through anaerobic fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>, which aligns with the vacuum pan process used by Hershey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

Butyric acid is also naturally created in human digestive systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. When the contents of the digestive system are expelled (i.e., vomit), the signature "twang, smell, and taste" of butyric acid becomes apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. This inherent association is why people who did not grow up consuming Hershey chocolate often perceive its taste as similar to vomit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

## Cultural Perception and Objective Quality

For those who grew up eating Hershey's, the perception is very different because they have eaten it far more often than they've thrown up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. To them, butyric acid tastes like chocolate, not like sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.

For instance, when comparing [[differences_between_hershey_and_cadbury_chocolates | Cadbury]] to Hershey, some Americans find British chocolate "flat" or "dull" because it lacks the acidity they have been conditioned to expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

The presence of butyric acid highlights broader questions about how food quality is defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. While humans are evolved to find certain tastes and smells, like butyric acid, repulsive as an indicator of danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>, many "great foods" worldwide ride the line between enticement and revulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. For example, Europeans enjoy many fermented milk products like stinky cheeses, and parmesan cheese also contains butyric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.

Ultimately, for a dessert like chocolate, which serves a purely pleasure-giving purpose, subjective experience, particularly childhood memory, plays a significant role in its perceived quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

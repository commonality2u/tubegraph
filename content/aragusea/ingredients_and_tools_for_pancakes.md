This article provides a guide to the essential ingredients and tools for making pancakes, focusing on a basic, effective recipe. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> It also covers [[making_foolproof_pancake_batter | variations and tips]] for cooking. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>

## Essential Ingredients

The recipe emphasizes specific quantities and preparation techniques for each ingredient to achieve desired results.

*   **Butter**
    *   Approximately 2 tablespoons (about 14 grams) makes the pancakes moist and adds flavor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
    *   It should be partially melted, then swished around to melt the rest, ensuring it's not too hot to prevent curdling the egg. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   **Sugar**
    *   2 tablespoons (about 25 grams) is used. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   It helps lower the butter's temperature before the egg is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> and enhances browning without making the pancakes overly sweet. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Egg**
    *   One whole egg is used. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
    *   Beating the egg thoroughly helps liquefy it and emulsify the butter into the batter, preventing the butter from solidifying badly when cold milk is added. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   **Vanilla**
    *   A couple of teaspoons of vanilla extract are added, primarily for flavor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   **Milk**
    *   About 1.5 to 1.75 cups (approximately 400 ml) of milk is used, enough to make two full cups of total liquid with the other ingredients. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> The proportions do not need to be precise. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   **Salt**
    *   One teaspoon of kosher salt (about 6 grams) is suggested. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> More salt may be desired if using unsalted butter. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   **Baking Powder**
    *   A heaped tablespoon (about a tablespoon plus a teaspoon or 16 grams) is needed for fluffy pancakes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   **All-purpose Flour**
    *   Typically, starting with about 1.5 cups (200 grams) is recommended. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
    *   The amount of flour is the most variable part, adjusted based on desired pancake thickness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
    *   It is essential to not overmix the batter once the flour is added; it should still have small lumps. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> Overmixing makes pancakes tough. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>

### Ingredient Variations

*   **Half Batch:** For a smaller quantity, use only the egg yolk, discarding the white. This can make the pancakes even better. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
*   **Buttermilk:** Using real buttermilk instead of milk adds a distinct lactic acid taste. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a> When using buttermilk, replace baking powder with baking soda (sodium bicarb), using about one teaspoon maximum to neutralize the acid and create bubbles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>

## Batter Preparation Tools

*   **1-quart Pyrex Measuring Jug:** An ideal vessel for making batter, especially for melting butter directly in the microwave. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   **Fork or Whisk:** A fork works fine for mixing, though a whisk can also be used. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   **Measuring Cup:** A small measuring cup helps achieve perfectly round pancakes when scooping batter onto the cooking surface. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>
*   **Pancake Batter Dispenser:** While these are designed to give perfectly round pancakes, they may only work well with thinner batters, as thick batter does not flow evenly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>

## Cooking Surfaces and Tools

Several options are available for cooking pancakes, each with advantages.

*   **10-inch Nonstick Skillet:** A widely available and easy option for cooking pancakes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
*   **Stainless Steel Pan:** Can be used, but may require a little extra butter and a slightly longer cook time on the first side to prevent sticking. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
*   **Stick of Butter:** Used to test pan temperature; butter fizzes when it reaches boiling point and milk solids visibly brown, indicating readiness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
*   **Cooling Rack:** Essential for preventing pancakes from becoming soggy after cooking. Steam will condense if left on a flat plate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>
    *   A cooked pancake can be rested on a cooling rack for a few minutes, allowing carryover cooking to finish the interior. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
*   **Flat Square Griddle Pan:** A very cheap and effective specialized piece of equipment for cooking multiple pancakes at once, especially smaller ones. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
*   **Electric Tabletop Griddle:** A large, wide electric griddle is the best option for cooking many pancakes simultaneously, ensuring they are all done at the same time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
*   **Spatula:** A normal home kitchen spatula may be too small for a 10-inch pancake, making [[cooking_techniques_and_flipping_pancakes | flipping difficult]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   **Sieve or Shaker Cup:** Used for dusting pancakes with powdered sugar. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>

### Heat Management

*   A little south of medium heat is often perfect. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   **Water Test:** Flicking water into the pan can indicate temperature:
    *   Sits there: Too cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
    *   Fizzes right out: Too hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
    *   Dances: Perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   **Butter Test:** Put batter in when butter is just barely starting to brown. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>

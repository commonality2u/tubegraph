The choice between salted and unsalted butter doesn't significantly impact most home cooking, provided one understands the type of butter they have and adjusts accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## The Role of Salt in Butter History

Butter naturally contains trace amounts of sodium from the milk it's made from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Historically, salt was added to butter primarily for preservation, not taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This [[historical_use_of_salt_in_butter | ancient preservation method]] was also used with fish and meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Elaine Kostova, a classically trained pastry chef and author of "Butter: A Rich History," highlights that butter was a natural candidate for salting if it needed to be kept for any length of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. An exception to this was in India, where butter was preserved by boiling it down to evaporate the liquid, creating ghee, which prevents bacterial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Ghee was a necessity in the hot Indian subcontinent as solid butter melts above 90°F (32°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

The Western tradition of solid butter making likely originated in Northern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The Vikings, considered early European butter makers, produced butter that was about ten times saltier than modern salted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This highly salted butter would later be soaked in cold water to leach out excess salt, making it edible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Salt Content Then and Now

Modern salted butter, such as Land O'Lakes (the most popular in the U.S.), contains about 90 milligrams of sodium per tablespoon (14 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This translates to roughly 1.64% salt by weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Viking-era butter, at 10 times this salinity, would have been around 16.4% salt, requiring about 2.3 grams of salt per tablespoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This amount of salt is comparable to about half a teaspoon of [[usage_of_kosher_salt_in_culinary_practices | Morton kosher salt]] in a tablespoon of butter, making it overpoweringly salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, but providing the necessary preservation for periods like winter or long voyages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

In the 19th century, a "pickled butter" recipe in a White House cookbook involved wrapping freshly made butter in muslin and soaking it in a brine of salt and a little sugar for preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Even in medieval times, table butter was likely three times as salty as modern salted butter, around 4.9% salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Dairy industry publications from about a century ago describe butter with 3-4% salt, which was considered the minimum to keep butter fresh for more than a few days without refrigeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Unsalted Butter

The significant decrease in butter's salt content was primarily due to the advent of refrigeration and industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Large-scale, temperature-controlled logistical networks allowed for the delivery of fresh butter, reducing the need for high salt levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Factories marketed their butter as having less salt, implying freshness and that they weren't masking rancidity or "off flavors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

This shift also capitalized on a long-standing [[cultural_perceptions_of_butter_types | cultural notion]] that unsalted butter was fancier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The French, particularly in regions outside Paris, produced unsalted, cultured butter, which was highly prized and sold for twice or three times the price of regular salted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Cultured butter, made with bacterial cultures, is fermented and tangy like yogurt, serving as an alternative preservation method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. For wealthy families not living on farms, contracting a dairy maid to make small batches of unsalted butter was a luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Before refrigeration, unsalted butter that hadn't spoiled was a true luxury item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

In the 1960s and 70s, chefs like Julia Child and Jacques Pépin introduced the American palate to unsalted butter not just for the table, but also for [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Later, Alton Brown popularized the use of unsalted butter for standardization and precision in home kitchens, advocating for measuring ingredients by weight to control salt levels in food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Practical Advice for Home Cooks

While professional kitchens often prioritize precision and standardization, requiring exact measurements, the home kitchen offers more flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The ultimate goal for a home cook is to make something they enjoy, and personal salt preference is highly variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

The speaker, who previously used unsalted butter exclusively due to Alton Brown's influence, now uses salted butter frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. For bread, they prefer [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | heterogeneous seasoning]]: unsalted butter spread with a sprinkle of coarse, flaky salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

When using salted butter for cooking, one can calculate and adjust for the salt content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. For example, a stick of Land O'Lakes salted butter (8 tablespoons) contains about 720 milligrams of sodium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. While there are slight variations between brands (e.g., Vermont Creamery at 80mg, Carrygold at 100mg, President at 110mg per tablespoon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, the range is generally confined, making adjustments straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### The Importance of Tasting

Rather than strict mathematical adjustments, the best approach for home cooking is to taste the food as you go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Add butter, salted or not, and then taste; if more salt is needed, add it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

Even with baked goods, where tasting raw batter carries a slight risk of foodborne illness (and should be avoided if immunosuppressed), it's possible to taste for seasoning before baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

Julia Child, in "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" (1961), stated that "except for cake frostings and certain desserts for which we have specified unsalted butter, American salted and French butter are interchangeable in cooking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This emphasizes that for most dishes, the type of butter is not a rigid constraint.

When writing recipes, the speaker often specifies salted butter because it's more popular in North America and the UK, which constitute the majority of their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. They assume that cooks advanced enough to use unsalted butter can easily adjust the salt content themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Ultimately, there is room for both precise and "feel it out as you go" cooking approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. For everyday dinners, making it to your liking is more important than strict adherence to professional standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

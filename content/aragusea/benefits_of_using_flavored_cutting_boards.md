From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Flavoring the cutting board, rather than directly seasoning the steak, leverages the principle that meat reabsorbs moisture as it cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This method, often referred to as [[seasoning_cutting_board_instead_of_steak | seasoning the cutting board instead of the steak]], allows the meat to "suck up moisture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> and flavor after cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Only oil is applied to the steak before it goes into the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The [[dressing_the_board_technique | Dressing the Board Technique]]

This is a classic technique where flavorings are prepared directly on the cutting board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A key benefit is that all the prep for flavorings can be done while the steak is already cooking, saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. After cooking and resting, the steak is placed on top of these ingredients, sliced, and then tossed in the mixture to absorb the flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Flavor Components

A variety of ingredients can be used to flavor the cutting board:

*   **Rosemary** - Chopped rosemary is commonly used, as rosemary and steak are considered a "chef's kiss" combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The heat from the resting steak softens the rosemary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Garlic** - A small clove of garlic, finely grated with a microplane, is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Because it's "virtually raw," caution is advised with the amount used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The heat of the steak helps take the "edge" off the raw garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This highlights the [[uses_of_raw_ingredients_in_steak_preparation | benefits of using raw ingredients]] in steak preparation.
*   **Citrus** - A touch of citrus like lemon, lime, or even grapefruit can be added to the board for flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Pepper** - Coarsely ground pepper is preferred raw on the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Cooking pepper on the steak can cause it to burn and takes away much of its pungency, which is why restaurants offer it at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Salt** - A small amount of salt can go on the board for even distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The bulk of the salt is recommended as a super coarse finishing salt, applied later for "big crunchy crystals" and "little sparks of salt" rather than a uniform saltiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Butter** - Slivers of fresh butter are placed on the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The milky taste of fresh butter contrasts well with the deep flavor of steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, a practice observed in many classic American steak houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The steak's heat melts the butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Advantages of the Method

*   **Flavor Absorption** - As the steak rests and cools on the seasoned board, it reabsorbs the juices that come out of the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Tossing the sliced meat in this "pool of flavor-augmented beef juice" ensures these valuable juices are reclaimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Even Flavor Distribution** - By tossing the sliced steak in the accumulated flavors and juices, the seasonings are evenly distributed throughout each bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Time Efficiency** - The prep for flavorings can be done simultaneously with cooking the steak, leading to a quick "start to dinner" time of about 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Flavor Control** - Applying ingredients like pepper raw prevents burning and preserves pungency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Versatility** - Any tender cut of meat and a wide variety of flavors can be used with this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Even without additional flavoring, tossing the meat in its own juices is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Serving Considerations

To prevent the meat from going cold after slicing and resting, it is recommended to either eat it straight off the board or warm the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. A plate can be warmed by running it under hot water on both sides for a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. A hot plate can even reheat a well-rested piece of meat, which is why steak houses typically heat their plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

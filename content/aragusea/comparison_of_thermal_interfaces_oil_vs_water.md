The internet's popular method for cooking mushrooms involves starting them in water instead of oil or butter, with oil added only at the end for browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This "water trick" is considered a viral recipe hack, partly because it seems to contradict classical culinary dogma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Classical Culinary Dogma and the "Water Trick"

French culinary tradition suggests that getting mushrooms wet will "water log" them and dilute their flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The classical cleaning method for mushrooms is to brush off dirt without washing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. However, this belief is largely considered silly, as mushrooms squeeze water out when cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Cooking mushrooms in water feels like a satisfying repudiation of this questionable past practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Mushroom Structure and Oil Absorption

A mushroom's structure is similar to bread: a fibrous network enclosing water, but mostly air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This foamy structure is finer in mushrooms, with tiny air pockets inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The entire mushroom is made of densely interwoven fungal threads (hyphae), which appear solid but contain vast empty spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

When browning items like bread or mushrooms in a pan with oil, the oil diffuses into these vacant cavities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This means more oil might need to be added to brown all sides, potentially leading to the food becoming saturated with oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Challenges of Conventional Oil Frying

When cooking mushrooms in oil, the oil seems to disappear quickly as it's absorbed by the spongy mushroom structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. After a few minutes, the hyphae network breaks down, and water inside the mushroom spills out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This causes water to hit the hot oil, leading to spitting and mess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

When a large pile of mushrooms is cooked (common as they shrink significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>), the released water can flood the pan, causing the temperature to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Browning cannot occur in water, so all the water must evaporate before browning can resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### [[role_of_oil_in_cooking | Role of Oil]] as a [[thermal_interfaces_in_cooking | Thermal Interface]]

Oil serves as a [[thermal_interfaces_in_cooking | thermal interface]] by filling gaps between the pan surface and the food, effectively transmitting heat into the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Cooking mushrooms in a dry pan results in sticking, burning in direct contact spots, and steaming elsewhere, necessitating oil for even heat distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Cooking Mushrooms with Water First

The "water trick" involves using a thin film of water in a hot pan in place of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Water is also a very effective [[thermal_interfaces_in_cooking | thermal interface]], preventing sticking and cooking mushrooms down quickly by spreading heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

However, water has limitations:
*   **Temperature:** Under normal atmospheric conditions, water can only reach 100°C before evaporating, which is not hot enough for browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Overcooking:** To achieve browning with this method, mushrooms must be cooked until their spongy structure collapses and most of their internal water evaporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This often results in the mushrooms being overcooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Once the water has evaporated, a little oil can be added to brown the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This method is less messy due to the absence of the spitting stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Comparing Textures and Hypotheses

One criticism of the water-first method is that the texture can become leathery, possibly due to overcooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. While plant cell walls (reinforced with pectin) break down during cooking, mushroom cell walls (reinforced with chitin) are more stable at high temperatures and don't break down as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. However, prolonged cooking can fully collapse the mushroom's hyphae structure, leading to an unpleasantly dense texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

When cooking mushrooms conventionally (starting in oil), it's possible to cook them hot and fast to achieve color before the water comes out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Often, the cook doesn't need to wait for all the water to evaporate for a second browning phase, aiming instead for the mushrooms to shrink by about half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This leaves some internal cavities, resulting in a more pleasant texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Evidence for Structural Collapse

A raw mushroom slice floats in water due to its airy cavities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   A conventionally sautéed mushroom slice floats but slowly sinks, indicating some remaining air within its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   A mushroom slice cooked in water before browning in oil sinks quickly "like a stone," supporting the hypothesis that its internal cavities have fully collapsed due to the longer cooking time required to evaporate water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

An alternative explanation for the conventionally sautéed mushroom floating is that it absorbed more oil, which also floats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. While mushrooms do absorb a lot of oil initially, they also squeeze some back out as they cook and shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Both cooking methods are effective, and the results are very similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

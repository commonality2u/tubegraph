When interacting with cacti, particularly the [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | prickly pear]] (Opuntia genus), it's crucial to be aware of glochids, which are tiny, barbed spines that pose significant health hazards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. These are a primary concern when considering [[eating_cactus_safely | eating cactus safely]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## What are Glochids?
Beyond the large, visible thorns on cacti, there are many nearly microscopic spines called glochids (or glochidia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. These "hairy little demons" are difficult to see and are barbed, designed to hook into skin and detach from the plant upon contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Some varieties of [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | prickly pear]] may have more glochids than others, and their prevalence can depend on the season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Symptoms and Effects
You might not even notice glochids when they first embed in your skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. If you attempt to pull them out, the barbed tips often break off and remain under the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
Common symptoms include:
*   A minor but sharp pain when pressure is applied to the affected area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   A generalized dull aching sensation in the skin, which can persist for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   Inflammation or dermatitis, which some individuals may react particularly strongly to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
Carelessly brushing against a cactus can result in being covered in millions of these tiny spines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Prevention and Removal
Preventing contact with glochids is key, especially during [[harvesting_and_preparing_prickly_pear_fruit | harvesting and preparing prickly pear fruit]]:
*   **Use Tongs:** Always use tongs when handling [[prickly_pear_cactus_and_its_edible_parts | prickly pear]] fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Twist, Don't Pull:** When harvesting fruit, twist it off the plant rather than pulling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

If glochids do get on your skin, researchers at the St. Louis College of Pharmacy in the 1980s found an effective method for removal and inflammation prevention:
1.  Immediately remove any exposed parts of the glochids with tweezers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
2.  Apply a household glue to the affected area, allow it to dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
3.  Rip off the dried glue to extract the embedded glochids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Removing Glochids from Edible Parts
It is critical to remove glochids from the fruit (tuna) and pads (nopales) before consumption, as they would be even more painful on the tongue or in the throat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. They are small enough to pass through a strainer, making them a risk even in juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

Several methods are used to remove glochids from the edible parts:
*   **Scrubbing:** Some people use a stiff scrubby brush under running water, washing and rinsing multiple times to remove loose glochids. This might be more effective for store-bought varieties that appear to have fewer glochids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Sand Rolling:** An ancient method involves vigorously rolling the fruits in sand, which theoretically dislodges the prickles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Fire:** A traditional and effective method is to kill the glochids with fire, using a gas stove burner or a campfire. The glochids will ignite and shrivel up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. After flaming, the fruit or pad can be washed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Filleting/Peeling:** After treatment, the fruit can be filleted with a knife while holding it upright with a fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. For pads, they can be shaved with a knife, but glochids may fall into the sticky mucilage of the nopales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

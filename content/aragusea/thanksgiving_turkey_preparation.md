The approach aims to minimize dishes, ensure juicy white meat and tender dark meat, and produce a rich, flavorful gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It also includes tips for efficient [[carving_and_serving_turkey | carving and serving]] hot turkey without time crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Turkey Selection and [[thawing_a_frozen_turkey | Thawing]]

A 12-pound frozen turkey is recommended as it's often more affordable and easier to find in the desired type and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This size is ideal for feeding many people while cooking quickly and evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Thawing Methods
*   **Speed Thawing**: Submerge the frozen turkey in cool water from the sink, breast-side down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The density of water is more effective at drawing cold out of the meat than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This method takes 6 to 8 hours (at least an hour for every two pounds), requiring the water to be changed every half hour to keep it moving and prevent it from getting too cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Fridge Thawing**: If time permits, thaw the turkey in the refrigerator, allowing one day for every four or five pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

After thawing, the turkey can be moved back to the fridge for a day or roasted immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Preparation and [[turkey_roasting_and_seasoning_techniques | Seasoning]]

To minimize cleanup and capture all juices for gravy, open the turkey directly in the roasting tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Key Steps
1.  **Remove Giblets**: Take out the gizzard, heart, and neck; these can be placed at the bottom of the tray to flavor the gravy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
2.  **Score Legs**: Make deep cuts straight down to the bone on the legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This helps them cook quicker, soften, and severs stringy tendons, making the turkey leg more edible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
3.  **Season**: Apply generous amounts of pepper and salt to coat the entire bird, including the underside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
4.  **Herb Combination**: Use sage and thyme for a classic Thanksgiving flavor, being mindful not to overdo the strong sage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
5.  **Roasting Fat**: Clarified butter (ghee) is considered ideal for turkey roasting, providing a milky flavor compared to oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Whole butter is less ideal as its milk solids can burn and water content can make the skin gummy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Ensure the fat is rubbed all over the bird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Roasting the Turkey

This [[roasting_techniques_for_turkey | roasting technique]] utilizes a combination of stovetop and oven cooking to ensure both white and dark meat are perfectly cooked.

### Initial Setup
1.  **Stovetop Start**: Place the roasting tray with the seasoned turkey on a medium burner to bring significant heat to the dark meat at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
2.  **Preheat Oven**: While on the stovetop, preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) with convection roast if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
3.  **Probe Thermometers**: Insert one probe into the deepest part of the thigh and a second into the deepest part of the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
4.  **Add Aromatics**: Place carrots, celery, and white onions (cut in half to prevent burning) into the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
5.  **Continue Stovetop Cooking**: Cook on the stovetop for at least 15 minutes, or up to half an hour, ensuring nothing burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This step significantly pre-cooks the dark meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Oven Roasting
1.  **Transfer to Oven**: Move the tray to the preheated oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The dark meat will already be at a high temperature (e.g., 144°F), addressing the common issue of white meat finishing before dark meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
2.  **Finish Cooking**: After about an hour, the breast will be nearing completion, and the dark meat will be "overdone," which makes it fall apart like barbecue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
3.  **Brown Skin**: Increase the oven temperature to 500°F (260°C) for the last 15 minutes to intensely brown the skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
4.  **Remove Turkey**: The turkey is ready to be removed when the breast reaches 162°F (72°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
5.  **Account for Carryover Heat**: Internal temperature will continue to rise by a few degrees (e.g., to 165°F or 74°C) after removal due to residual heat in the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. For a juicier result, you can pull the turkey at 155°F (68°C) and let it coast to 160°F (71°C), as 165°F is considered slightly overcooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
6.  **Resting**: Rest the bird uncovered for about an hour before slicing; this allows it to be handled easily and prevents significant juice loss when cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Removing Turkey from Pan
Use a metal spatula to loosen any stuck parts from the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Insert the spatula into the cavity, hold the breast with a clean towel, pick up the bird, and drain any cavity juices back into the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Since the bottom was precooked, there might not be much juice left in the cavity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## [[making_turkey_gravy | Gravy Preparation]]

This method focuses on creating a rich gravy directly in the roasting pan, minimizing extra dishes.

1.  **Reduce Pan Juices**: After removing the turkey, turn the burner on high to boil off as much water from the pan drippings as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Position the pan so deep liquid is over heat and drier parts are off heat to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The liquid will fizz more than boil when most water is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
2.  **Make a Roux**: Reduce heat to a bare simmer and mix flour directly into the fat in the pan to form a thick paste (roux) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This browning of the roux adds flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Using a stainless steel roasting tray helps visualize the browning fond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
3.  **Deglaze**: Gradually add carton of stock to deglaze the pan, scraping the fond off the bottom with a wooden spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
4.  **Simmer and Thicken**: Bring to a boil to observe thickness. Add more stock incrementally as needed, ensuring it doesn't surpass the roux's thickening capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The fat and starch will emulsify, preventing splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
5.  **Add Resting Juices**: Pour in any resting juices from the turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
6.  **Strain**: Strain the gravy through a sieve into a large bowl to remove solids and lumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
7.  **Season**: Taste and adjust seasoning, aiming for it to be slightly too salty as its salinity will be diluted by the blander meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## [[carving_and_serving_turkey | Carving and Serving]]

A large cutting board is highly recommended for efficient carving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. While a chef's knife works, a long, thin carving knife is beneficial for cleaner cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Carving Method
1.  **Separate Leg Quarters**: Cut the skin between the legs and breasts. Rather than precisely cutting, rip the leg quarters off like a "caveman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Even if the tissue around the hip joint is pink, it's safe if the thighs reached high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
2.  **Separate Leg from Thigh**: Cut into the crook between the leg and thigh until hitting bone, then pry them apart to expose the joint. Easily cut through the sinew connecting the joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
3.  **Remove Breast**: Make a cut along the side of the keel bone and lop off the entire breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Any meat left on the carcass can be salvaged later for leftovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
4.  **Slice Breast**: Observe the direction of the meat fibers on the underside of the breast and slice perpendicular to them for more tender slices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Slice very thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Arrange slices against each other to retain warmth and prevent evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
5.  **Prepare Thigh Meat**: While thighs can be sliced, it's preferred to tear chunks off by hand to easily distinguish meat from cartilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Line up the chunks and cut them into bite-sized pieces against the grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Serving Hot Turkey
Place all carved meat in large piles on an oven-safe decorative metal serving platter (or a sheet pan) to discourage evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This platter can then be placed back into the oven right before serving, allowing the meat to be reheated and stay hot without rushing dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. After 5 minutes in the oven, the meat will be hot and remain so on the heated platter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

Serve breast slices, dark meat hunks, and scored legs, drenching everything in gravy for moisture and flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

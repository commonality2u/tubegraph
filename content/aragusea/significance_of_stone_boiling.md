Wet cooking methods, such as boiling and stewing, are fundamental to human cuisine. Before the [[invention_and_evolution_of_cooking_vessels | invention of cooking vessels]] capable of direct fire exposure, early humans developed ingenious ways to cook food in water. Roasting food directly in a fire was the earliest method, pioneered by *Homo erectus* hundreds of thousands of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. However, the epiphany of wet cooking, particularly through stone boiling, emerged tens of thousands of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Early Wet Cooking Methods

The precise origin of the first soup or stew is uncertain, as the perishable nature of early cooking implements leaves little archaeological evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Much of the understanding is based on scholarly speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

In 2015, anthropologist John Speth proposed that wet cooking might be much older than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. He empirically demonstrated that a flammable material, such as an animal hide filled with wet ingredients, would not burn when held directly over a fire due to the water keeping it cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While the experiment showed water dripping out and extinguishing the fire, ancient people might have used more waterproof vessels like an animal stomach or a clay-lined woven basket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Archaeological evidence supports the antiquity of wet cooking. A grain of boiled barley recovered from a Neanderthal tooth in modern-day Iraq suggests that Neanderthals consumed wet-cooked food approximately 50,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This predates the first archaeological indications of more advanced wet cooking methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## The Pot Boiler Technique

Stone boiling, also known as using a "pot boiler," involves dropping hot rocks into a water-safe container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This method was widely used for thousands of years until fire-safe and water-safe [[invention_and_evolution_of_cooking_vessels | cooking vessels]] became common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

To replicate this technique:
1.  Dig a small pit and line it with a large, non-porous leaf, such as a banana leaf, to hold water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
2.  Heat smooth river cobbles in a nearby fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Smooth stones are preferred as they are less likely to chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
3.  Carefully transfer the hot stones into the water-filled basin containing the food to be cooked (e.g., grains) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Multiple stones are needed to achieve and maintain a boil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Crazing of Stones
Repeatedly heating stones and rapidly cooling them in water causes a characteristic pattern of cracking and glazing known as "crazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This phenomenon gives us the words "crazy" and "crazed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Crazed river cobbles first appear in the archaeological record around 30,000 years ago, during the Upper Paleolithic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. While their specific use as pot boilers is not always certain, the presence of crazed stones suggests heated rock technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Stone boiling was a persistent method, used well into the era of written history and still practiced by some today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. It proved surprisingly effective, allowing for the cooking of grains to a soft texture in about an hour using only a hole and a leaf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. A significant advantage was that sand or pebbles mixed with raw grains would sink to the bottom of the water, preventing their consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Advantages of Wet Cooking

Wet cooking, facilitated by methods like stone boiling, represented a significant advance for humanity due to its many [[biological_and_social_impacts_of_cooking | benefits of long cooking processes]]:
*   **Nutrient Extraction:** It allowed for greater extraction of nutrients from food because nothing was wasted by dripping into the fire; all components were preserved in the broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Food Softening:** Tough foods could be softened into a form that was easier to chew and digest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Increased Food Availability:** Soup, as a product of wet cooking, could feed more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Nixtamalization
Scientists believe that stone boiling may have led to the invention of nixtamalization by ancient Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Nixtamalization is the process of soaking corn in an alkaline solution to remove its waxy hull and make hominy, grits, and tortillas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Crucially, it also renders certain amino acids in corn more bioavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Without nixtamalization, a diet based solely on corn can lead to the nutritional deficiency disease pellagra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

It is speculated that nixtamalization might have been discovered accidentally. In 2011, scientists demonstrated that boiling corn with Limestone pot boilers, as ancient people in Utah would have done with Cedar Mesa Limestone, produced water that was alkaline enough to nixtamalize the corn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. While not definitive proof, this experiment shows the possibility of such an accidental discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Transition to Ceramic Pots

Despite its effectiveness, stone boiling in materials like leaves or animal skins had disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The shift to cooking in pots directly over fire represented a major leap forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The development of [[development_of_pottery_for_cooking | pottery]] allowed for more convenient and efficient wet cooking.

Early pottery was likely discovered by people digging for clay, possibly for other purposes like lining pits for stone boiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The discovery that clay could be molded and hardened by drying, and crucially, fired into a water-insoluble ceramic, revolutionized cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The earliest archaeological evidence of ceramic pottery, found in China, dates back 20,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

Clay pots remained the primary [[history_of_food_boiling_techniques | cooking vessels]] for a long time, extending beyond the Stone Age into the Bronze and Iron Ages, and even into the early modern period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. While metal pots are superior in thermal conductivity and resistance to thermal stress, their high cost made ceramic pots a universal and effective solution for millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

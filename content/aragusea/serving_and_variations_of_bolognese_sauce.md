[[nontraditional_bolognese_sauce | Bolognese sauce]] is a versatile dish that can be used for many purposes and is easy to freeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Serving Suggestions

### Classic Preparation
When serving bolognese, drain the pasta and add a couple of large spoonfuls of sauce per portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Garnishments
Garnish with fresh parsley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, grated cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, and a drizzle of raw olive oil on the plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Remember that sauces should be intentionally strong in flavor, as their taste will be diluted by the rest of the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Variations

### Creamy Bolognese
For a creamy variation, spoon some sauce into a pot and drizzle in heavy cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Boil it until the cream thickens, then add the pasta and some fresh basil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This results in a sauce that is sweet, sour, meaty, velvety, and rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Reheating Frozen Sauce
[[freezing_and_storing_bolognese_sauce | Freezing bolognese sauce]] in ice cube trays makes it easy to thaw the exact amount needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. To reheat, grab about three cubes per person, place them in a bowl, and microwave until thawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. While the sauce is still hot, add a little more balsamic vinegar to brighten its flavor after being in the freezer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The heat of the sauce will boil off the harsh scent of the vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This allows for a deeply flavored, slow-simmered meal in about 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Other Applications
Leftover bolognese sauce can be used to make lasagna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

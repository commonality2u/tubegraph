To create flavorful and tender chicken, especially for dishes like chicken parmesan, specific preparation and marinating techniques can be employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Chicken Preparation for Marinating

Chicken breasts, often too thick, are cut in half to ensure a better meat-to-crust proportion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. After halving, the meat is pounded out using a meat mallet or a tool with spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This pounding serves multiple purposes:
*   It flattens the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   It tenderizes the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   It creates holes in the meat, allowing it to better receive the [[marinating_chicken_for_tandoori | marinade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Marinade Ingredients and Application

Rather than [[seasoning_and_dry_curing_chicken | seasoning]] the breading, it is more effective to [[use_of_spices_and_seasonings_in_cooking | season]] the meat directly, making it easier to gauge the correct amount of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The key ingredients for this chicken marinade include:
*   **Salt and Pepper** A heavy sprinkling of salt and pepper is applied to each side of the chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This [[timing_for_salting_meat_before_cooking | salting of the meat]] ensures the seasoning penetrates the chicken itself.
*   **Garlic** A significant amount of chopped garlic (four or five cloves) is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **White Wine** A splash of white wine is incorporated into the bowl with the chicken and garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The chicken, salt, pepper, garlic, and white wine are swished together and then tossed in the fridge to [[marinating_chicken_for_tandoori | marinate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Flavor Contribution

The white wine [[marinating_chicken_for_tandoori | marinade]] is noted for making the entire dish taste "sweet and bright," contributing significantly to the overall flavor balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Additionally, the saltiness from grated Pecorino cheese incorporated directly into the panko breading helps to [[use_of_spices_and_seasonings_in_cooking | season]] the coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

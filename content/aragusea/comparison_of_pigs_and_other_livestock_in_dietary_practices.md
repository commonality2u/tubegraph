Pork is a polarizing meat, being by some accounts the most popular globally, accounting for over a third of global meat consumption, yet simultaneously avoided by about a third of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This avoidance is largely due to [[religious_prohibitions_on_eating_pork | religious prohibitions]], with Islam strictly forbidding it and Hinduism generally not favoring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Religious Dietary Laws

The [[historical_and_cultural_origins_of_the_pork_taboo | historical and cultural origins of the pork taboo]] are not clearly understood, with anthropologists, archaeologists, and theologians long arguing the matter without scholarly consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Abrahamic Traditions
The Torah, specifically Leviticus and Deuteronomy (written in the first millennium BCE), is where the pork taboo is first codified in Abrahamic religious law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Ancient Jewish law states that pork is forbidden because pigs have a cloven hoof but do not chew their cud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

*   **Cloven Hoof**: A hoof divided into multiple toes, like that of a deer, cow, goat, or sheep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Horses, for example, have a single-piece hoof with no toes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Chewing the Cud**: This refers to ruminant animals (like cows, goats, and sheep) that can digest cellulose found in grass and plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. They swallow grass, bacteria in their guts ferment it, and then they regurgitate and chew it further before re-swallowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Pigs, unlike ruminants, do not chew their cud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Their digestive systems are very similar to humans, meaning they primarily eat what humans eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

The Quran simply states that the flesh of swine is forbidden, alongside carrion and blood, unless one is starving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Theories for Avoidance

### [[theories_on_health_and_safety_reasons_for_avoiding_pork | Health and Safety Reasons]]

A theory popular in the 19th century suggested that pork prohibitions were ancient health and safety codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This theory gained traction when the link between trichinosis, a parasitic disease, and roundworms in undercooked pork was discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Intellectuals of the time sought to reconcile religious teachings with new scientific knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

However, recent scholarship, notably by American anthropologist Marvin Harris in the 1980s, casts doubt on this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Harris argued there's nothing exceptional about pork as a source of human disease, as all domestic animals are potentially hazardous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

*   **Comparison to Other Animals**:
    *   Herd animals like cattle and sheep can transmit anthrax, a severe bacterial infection, to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. There is evidence that ancient people knew about anthrax (possibly the fifth plague of Egypt or mentioned by Homer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   In contrast, there is no evidence that trichinosis was prevalent in the ancient Middle East or that ancient people were aware of its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Meat parasites cause relatively mild, often asymptomatic illnesses that can take years to develop, making it hard for ancient people to link them to meat consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Conclusion on Health Theory**: Harris suggests this theory is a projection of 19th-century European and American experiences onto ancient peoples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Uncleanliness and Economic Efficiency

Maimonides, a 12th-century philosopher and physician, argued that the primary reason for forbidding swine's flesh was their dirty and loathsome habits and food sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. He noted that allowing pork consumption would make streets and houses dirtier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

Pigs are observed to be conspicuously grosser than most farm animals, eating trash, roadkill, and even human excrement, and wallowing in mud (potentially their own excrement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

*   **Marvin Harris's Environmental and Economic Theory**:
    *   Harris finds the "filth" argument more persuasive, but notes that pigs only resort to such behavior when humans leave them no other option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   In forested areas, wild or domesticated pigs are not gross; they root for seeds, nuts, and truffles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. They also wallow in mud for cooling due to a lack of sweat glands and small lungs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   The theory posits that population growth in the Middle East during the Iron Age led to deforestation and desertification, forcing pigs to wallow for cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    *   Urbanization further exacerbated this, as pigs were attracted to city dumps filled with food scraps and human waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This led to pigs being viewed as unclean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
    *   **Competition for Food**: Pigs, having similar digestive systems to humans, compete for the same foods like grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. In the arid Middle East, pigs became both gross and uneconomical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
    *   **Comparison to Other Regions**: In places like ancient Rome, where the environment was less arid and food was abundant, pigs didn't compete with humans. Instead, urban pigs cleaned streets of waste and converted it into protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This "natural synergy" also made pork popular in rapidly urbanizing China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Alternate Explanations and Cultural Distinction

*   **Goats and Chickens**: Counter-arguments to Harris's theory point out that goats also eat "absolutely anything," including feces, yet Jews and Muslims have no religious opposition to eating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Similarly, chickens are eaten despite their coops being dirty and their reliance on grains that humans could eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Chicken as a Better Alternative**: Archaeologist Richard Redding's 2015 paper suggests that chickens may have supplanted pork in the Middle Eastern diet because they were simply better suited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
    *   Like pigs, chickens can live in cramped urban spaces and convert food scraps into protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
    *   However, chickens do it more efficiently, produce eggs in addition to meat, and are smaller, making them easier to kill, cook, and consume entirely in a hot climate where meat spoils quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
    *   Redding argues that chickens were simply a more practical choice for the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **[[cultural_identity_and_dietary_distinctions | Cultural Identity and Dietary Distinctions]]**: It is clear that once the pork taboo took hold, it became a means for people to distinguish themselves from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
    *   Archaeological findings indicate that pig eating never entirely stopped in the Middle East, even among ancient Jews in some regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Laws are typically made against behaviors that are occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
    *   The law in the Torah might have been a mechanism to assimilate northern Jews, who likely still ate pork, into the southern culture that eschewed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   Over time, the pork taboo became a way for Israelites to distinguish themselves from Romans, and later for Muslims to differentiate themselves from "dirty crusading Franks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

While the exact origin remains uncertain, the persistence and spread of the pork taboo are understandable given its role in defining group identity and cultural practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

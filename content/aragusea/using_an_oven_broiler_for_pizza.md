This method allows for baking a great pizza in a normal home oven without the use of a pizza stone or pizza steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It achieves a brown, crispy bottom by cooking the pizza directly on the oven grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While the result tastes a little different from a traditional pie, it is very tasty and quick, eliminating the need to preheat the oven on maximum for an hour to heat a stone or steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This approach effectively involves [[alternative_methods_of_baking_pizza | grilling the pizza]] inside your oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Oven and Grate Setup

1.  **Activate Broiler:** Turn on your broiler (the filament at the top of your oven, which Brits call a grill) all the way hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  **Position Grate:** Ensure your oven grate is reasonably clean and positioned high up. The second from the top position often works well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
3.  **Preheat Grate:** While broilers heat quickly, allow a few minutes for the grate itself to heat up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. A quick test is to place a wet towel on the grate; if it sizzles, it's hot enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The grate should come to temperature in the time it takes to prep your dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Dough Preparation

*   **Cold Dough:** It helps significantly if the dough is as cold as possible when it goes into the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Using dough straight from a cold rise (at least a day, up to a week in the refrigerator) is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Uniform Thickness:** This [[baking_techniques_for_pizza_at_home | baking method]] works much better if the dough is rolled out to an even thickness throughout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Uneven thickness can lead to thin spots burning while thicker areas remain pale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   Use a rolling pin, or if unavailable, a wine bottle can work well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   Roll and turn the dough as if rolling pastry to prevent sticking and ensure even stretching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   Aim for an oblong or rectangular shape, as this is easier to get into the oven and under the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   Roll it out slightly thicker than the final desired thinness, as it will stretch more during placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Oil Coating:** Coat the dough in a very thin film of olive oil quickly, before it warms up too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:02:02]</a>. Cold, stiff dough is easier to drape onto the hot oven grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## First Bake (Dough Only)

1.  **Draping the Dough:** Pull the oven grate out as far as it goes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Drape the dough onto the grate, oil-side down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
2.  **Even Placement:** If large areas of dough are falling far down, try to pick them up and stretch them to hang over the nearest grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The goal is to have every inch of dough as equal a distance as possible from the broiler for even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
3.  **Broil and Watch:** Slide the grate back in and close the oven door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Watch it carefully, as this first part takes about three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
4.  **Leopard Spotting:** Look for the dough to start burning, aiming for a few burned spots known as "leopard spotting," which is standard on a traditional pizza crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
5.  **Initial Rotation (if needed):** If your broiler heats unevenly (e.g., hotter at the back), you can rotate the dough once it has cooked enough to release from the grates intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Rotate it as you flip it over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The oiled, preheated side should release easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Topping the Pizza

*   **Dress in Oven:** Dress the pizza directly on the grate in the oven for quick cooking, as taking it out to the countertop would slow down the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Sauce:** A simple sauce of Passata (kitchen-ready ground tomatoes) works well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. If using other crushed tomato products, you may need to add tomato paste to strengthen the flavor, along with some olive oil, a little sugar, and dried herbs like oregano or basil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Thin Layer:** Since it's a super thin pizza, use less sauce than your instinct might suggest to avoid sogginess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Cheese:**
    *   A little finely grated Parmesan on top of the sauce improves flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   For mozzarella, freshly grated whole milk, low-moisture mozzarella (like Boar's Head) is recommended, as pre-grated varieties have anti-caking agents that interfere with browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
    *   Fresh, high-moisture mozzarella (used in Neapolitan pizza) can be used, but put on less to prevent a soggy pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Second Bake (Topped Pizza)

1.  **Return to Broiler:** Slide the pizza back under the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
2.  **Close Door and Watch:** Again, closing the oven door usually provides a more even result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Watch it like a hawk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
3.  **Rotate Again:** If parts of the cheese (e.g., the back row of bubbles) look like they're going to burn due to broiler hot spots, rotate the pizza once the crust has solidified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
4.  **Cook to Desired Brownness:** Continue cooking until the cheese is as brown as you'd like, typically another minute or so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Cooling and Serving

*   Transfer the cooked pizza straight to a cooling rack to keep the crust crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   Allow it to cool and steam off for a few minutes before transferring to a cutting board and slicing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Benefits of this Method

The total cook time is around seven minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Since the sauce and cheese are only on for about half that time, you'll notice differences:
*   **Brighter Flavors:** The sauce retains a brighter color and flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Less Grease:** The cheese hardly breaks down, resulting in very little orange grease, unlike conventionally baked pizzas where cheese overheats and squeezes out oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Crispy Crust:** The crust is very crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Distinct Layers:** The top-side crust receives dry heat, which means it doesn't bond with the sauce and cheese as much, resulting in more distinct layers in the mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Quick Turnaround:** You can immediately bake another pizza after the first one, as the grates don't need significant time to recharge heat like a pizza stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Energy Efficient:** This is a relatively easy and energy-efficient method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **No Special Equipment:** It requires no special equipment beyond a standard home oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Why This Method is Preferred: Comparisons to Other [[baking_techniques_for_pizza_at_home | Baking Techniques]]

### vs. Hand-stretched Dough
*   **Problem:** Hand-stretching dough typically results in uneven thickness, with gossamer-thin areas in the center and a fluffy cornice around the edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Broiler Result:** When cooked under a broiler, these thin areas burn rapidly while thicker areas remain pale, leading to a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Conclusion:** [[pizza_baking_method_without_a_stone_or_steel | This method]] works much better if the dough is rolled out to a uniform thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### vs. Baking on a Baking Sheet
*   **Process:** One might consider [[using_nonstick_pans_vs_cast_iron_for_baking_pizza | baking on a baking sheet]] with oil-side down dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Broiler Result:** This method cooks much slower; it took eight minutes to get minimal color on the first side in one test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The crust becomes dry and hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Conclusion:** While edible, it tastes like pizza made with a pre-baked grocery store crust – essentially pizza toppings on a hot cracker, which is considered "good food but bad pizza" due to the overbaked crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The direct contact with the hot oven grates for radiant, convective, and conductive heat is crucial for quick cooking and less moisture loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This method also allows for intense heat from above to get great color on the cheese, which is often a problem with traditional grilled pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### vs. Baking on a Cooling Rack
*   **Process:** Placing oiled dough onto a cooling rack, then sliding the rack onto the oven grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Broiler Result:** While the dough gets heat on both sides, it doesn't touch the hot grates directly, so it still cooks slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. It took almost five minutes for insufficient color in a test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The crust can become hard and crackery, and does not merge with the toppings as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Preheating Cooling Rack:** Preheating the cooling rack under the broiler might help, but many cooling racks are not designed to withstand very high temperatures (e.g., above 500°F/260°C), as their coatings can break down or melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Even if a rack can take the heat, its thinner metal may retain and transfer less heat than the thicker oven grates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Conclusion:** This method is better than a cookie sheet but not as good as direct contact with the oven grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Tips for Success

*   **Experiment:** Every oven is different and will have its own eccentricities, such as broiler hot spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Practice:** Make a batch of four or eight dough balls and practice this method several times in your oven before attempting to make dinner for guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

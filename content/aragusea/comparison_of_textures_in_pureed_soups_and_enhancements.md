Tomato soup is often enjoyed as a pureed dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The ingredients for the soup, such as onion and fennel, do not require precision cutting if they are to be pureed later, as their initial form will be altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Pureed Soup Texture

After simmering, ingredients like whole tomatoes can be broken down with a potato masher to accelerate cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The soup is typically pureed using an immersion blender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This tool offers control, allowing the user to choose whether to blitz the soup until totally smooth or leave some texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Adding flour to the butter at the start of cooking creates a roux, which gives the soup a velvety texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

The initial pureed texture is described as "crude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. To achieve a "super smooth" texture, comparable to canned tomato soups, the pureed soup can be strained through a sieve using a stiff spoon to grind the soup into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. A food mill could also perform this function more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. After straining, only plant fibers will remain in the sieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Enhancing Pureed Soup Textures

Despite the appeal of a smooth texture, a common critique of pureed soups is their "homogeneity" or "baby food" like consistency, where "every bite is exactly the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. To counter this, several enhancements can be made:

*   **Chili Oil**: A simple homemade chili oil, made from dried chili flakes, olive oil, and a crushed garlic clove, can be spooned onto the soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This oil floats on top, creating "nice variety" as it can be dosed onto each spoonful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Fennel Fronds**: Chopped fronds from the fennel bulb can be scattered on top as a garnish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Adjusting Consistency**: After pureeing, the soup often needs a "ton of salt" and additional water if it is too thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Tomato paste can be added to enhance the tomato flavor and potentially thicken the soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. These adjustments contribute to the desired final texture and flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

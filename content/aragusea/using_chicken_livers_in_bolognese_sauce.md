Chicken livers can be incorporated into [[making_bolognese_sauce | bolognese sauce]] as a "secret ingredient" to enhance its flavor profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This technique was inspired by Barbara Lynch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Preparation and Addition

To use chicken livers in bolognese:
*   Add a pound of chicken livers to a food processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   Process them into a coarse, pate-like consistency, but not a smooth paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   Stir the processed livers into the sauce towards the end of the meat browning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Be careful not to overcook the liver, as it can become gritty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Impact on Flavor

Despite adding chicken livers, the finished [[making_bolognese_sauce | bolognese sauce]] will not taste like liver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Instead, the livers contribute significantly to making the meat sauce taste "meatier" than it would without them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. The inclusion of chicken livers can be kept a secret from those consuming the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

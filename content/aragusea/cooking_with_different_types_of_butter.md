The choice between [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | salted vs unsalted butter]] for cooking and baking is a common culinary debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While modern [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | salted butter]] is considerably less salty than its historical counterparts, it remains a point of discussion in the kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Historical Context of Salted Butter

Butter naturally contains trace amounts of sodium from milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Historically, additional salt was added to butter primarily for preservation, not taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. As explained by pastry chef and author Elaine Custerova, salt is an ancient preservative used for foods like fish and meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Therefore, butter was a natural candidate for salting to prolong its shelf life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The Western tradition of solid butter making likely originated in Northern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The Vikings, noted early European butter makers, produced butter that was exceptionally salty, containing about ten times more salt than today's salted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This highly salted butter, which would have been nearly inedible initially, was later soaked in cold water to leach out some of the salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This level of salt was necessary for [[preservation_and_fermentation_of_butter | preservation]] during winters when animals weren't lactating, or for long voyages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Even in medieval times, table butter was approximately three times as salty as what is now called [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | salted butter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. One hundred years ago, dairy industry publications show butter with three or four percent salt, which is two to three times saltier than modern butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This was likely the minimum amount of salt needed to keep butter fresh for more than a few days without refrigeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### An Alternative Preservation Method

In India, a different method was used to preserve butter: boiling it down to evaporate the liquid, creating ghee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The absence of water in ghee prevents bacterial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This was a practical necessity in the hot Indian subcontinent, as solid butter melts above 90°F (32°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The Impact of Modernization

The shift to less salty butter came with refrigeration and industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Large-scale, temperature-controlled logistics networks allowed fresh butter to be delivered to more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. As butter production moved to creameries and factories, a selling point became advertising less salt, implying the butter was fresh and not masking rancidity or "off flavors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## [[cultural_perceptions_of_butter_types | Cultural Perceptions of Butter Types]]

This marketing trend may have capitalized on a long-standing [[cultural_perceptions_of_butter_types | cultural notion]] that [[cultural_perceptions_of_butter_types | unsalted butter]] is fancier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The French, particularly in regions outside Paris, produced a high-quality, cultured (fermented) [[cultural_perceptions_of_butter_types | unsalted butter]] that commanded a much higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:06:00]</a>. This [[preservation_and_fermentation_of_butter | fermented]] butter is tangy, similar to yogurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. In the Anglophone world, anything French has long been associated with high class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Before refrigeration, [[cultural_perceptions_of_butter_types | unsalted butter]] that hadn't spoiled was a luxury item, often specially contracted by wealthy families from local dairymaids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

This [[cultural_perceptions_of_butter_types | social attitude]] persisted even with refrigeration. In the 1960s and 70s, chefs like Julia Child and Jacques Pépin introduced American palates to [[cultural_perceptions_of_butter_types | unsalted butter]] for both cooking and table use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Later, Alton Brown further popularized [[cultural_perceptions_of_butter_types | unsalted butter]] in home cooking, advocating for its use to achieve professional kitchen precision and standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. He taught cooks to measure by weight and use [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | unsalted butter]] to better control the amount of salt in food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Cooking with Different Butters: Practical Application

While precision in professional kitchens benefits from [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | unsalted butter]], for home cooks, the choice often comes down to convenience and personal preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The amount of salt in common [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | salted butters]] in the US is quite consistent, ranging from 80 to 110 milligrams of sodium per tablespoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This relatively confined range means one can easily account for the salt when using [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | salted butter]] in recipes, or simply adjust by taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

For personal cooking, tasting the food as you go allows for seasoning to individual preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. While tasting raw batters for baked goods carries some minor risk, it is often done to adjust seasoning before baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

Julia Child, in her 1961 classic *Mastering the Art of French Cooking*, stated that "except for cake frostings and certain desserts for which we have specified [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | unsalted butter]], American [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | salted and French butter]] are interchangeable in cooking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This suggests that for most applications, the type of butter used is not a critical factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

Recipes often specify [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | salted butter]] simply because it is more popular in North America and the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. For advanced cooks who prefer [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | unsalted butter]], adjusting the salt content is a simple modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Ultimately, the goal in home cooking is to make food that one likes, and personal salt perception and preference vary widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Both precise and "feel it out" cooking methods have their place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 
The internet communities for cooking and lifting share fundamental issues, often leading to unproductive arguments and flawed thought patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This discourse is often attributed to the core problem that in both fields, within a reasonable range of possibility, "everything basically works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This means everyone can be seen as "basically right," even if their methods differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Debates in Lifting Techniques

Many arguments in the lifting community revolve around minute details that often yield minimal practical differences.

*   **Side Laterals (Shoulder Exercise)**
    *   One common debate is whether to internally rotate the humerus (point pinkies up) or externally rotate (lead with thumbs) during side lateral raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. While studies might show slight differences in muscle activation (e.g., increased medial deltoid activation with external rotation), the actual data often reveals these differences to be very small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   For wider shoulder muscles, the most important factors are picking up a heavy thing and lifting it away from the body repeatedly until failure, resting, and repeating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Bench Press Range of Motion**
    *   Another debate concerns whether to use a full range of motion or "teeny little baby half reps" for exercises like the bench press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
    *   Professional bodybuilders often use partial reps, but their success is influenced by numerous factors, including genetics, pharmaceutical enhancement, professional training, and meticulously formulated diets, not just their form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Deadlift Grip Assistance**
    *   The use of straps for deadlifts raises a [[personal_goals_and_motivations_in_cooking_and_lifting | fundamental question about goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. If the goal is to move the most weight or grow specific muscles (e.g., glutes), straps can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. However, if the goal is to be able to pick up heavy things in the real world, where grip assistance isn't available, then strengthening grip without straps makes more sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Debates in Cooking Techniques

Similar to lifting, [[cooking techniques]] also feature debates over methods that yield minimal practical differences.

*   **Steak Searing**
    *   A common argument is between "classical cooking" (searing the outside first, then bringing the interior to temperature) and "reverse sear" (bringing the interior to temperature first, then searing the outside) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   Both methods, when done properly, will produce great results, making the argument unwinnable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Sauce Thickening**
    *   In Western cooking, there's a traditional idea that thickening sauces by reduction (concentrating gelatin from meat stock) is the "real" way, while using starch for instantaneous thickening is "cheating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
    *   This debate prompts a [[personal_goals_and_motivations_in_cooking and lifting | fundamental question about goals]]: Is the goal to have a delicious, clingy thick sauce, or to adhere to a specific method? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>

### Root Causes of Debates

Several factors contribute to these persistent debates:

*   **Difficulty in Isolating Variables**
    *   In both domains, outcomes are typically the result of numerous factors, making it difficult to isolate individual variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   For example, a professional bodybuilder's physique results from years of consistent training, diet, genetics, and pharmaceutical enhancement, not just a specific exercise form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   Similarly, a steak's quality might depend on the cut, heat control, or even the eater's hunger, not just the [[cooking_techniques | cooking method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Limited [[role of science and studies in cooking and bodybuilding | Scientific Research]]**
    *   There is relatively little scientific research dedicated to answering everyday questions in cooking and lifting compared to more publicly funded areas like industrial food manufacturing, food safety, or medical research (e.g., cancer, heart attacks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
    *   Existing studies on lifting, for instance, may use small sample sizes (e.g., 10 competitive bodybuilders) or measure indirect metrics like muscle activation (EMG) rather than actual growth or strength gain, and the correlation between EMG and actual muscle building is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
    *   This lack of definitive scientific answers leads to "bro science" â€” best guesses and anecdotal evidence filling the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Repetitive Nature and Mental Space**
    *   Both cooking and lifting involve highly repetitive motions, which, after a point, do not require significant mental energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
    *   This frees up "brain space" for individuals to obsess over minutiae like knife angles, garlic preparation, lifting angles, sets, and reps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. While these variables might make tiny differences, the obsession over them often overshadows the core, impactful practices (e.g., consistency, effort, progressive overload in lifting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Content Creation Marketplace**
    *   The digital content market exacerbates this obsession with minutiae. Content creators in both fields need new topics to discuss, often leading them to focus on small debates or even refute "stupid" videos by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This can create a parasitic relationship where the basic, undisputed aspects are covered less frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### The Positive Outcome: Questioning Purpose

Despite these issues, the debates in [[comparison of cooking and lifting internet communities | cooking and lifting discourse]] force participants to ask fundamental questions about "why we do what we do" and the purpose of their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

*   In lifting, this could mean prioritizing functional strength (e.g., being able to play with a child without being sore) over maximizing absolute muscle mass or specific aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
*   In cooking, it might lead to questioning whether the goal is to "have something good to eat" or to strictly "make something good to eat" (e.g., preferring convenience over scratch-made ingredients) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

Ultimately, once a basic level of competency is achieved, it may be more valuable to obsess over *why* an activity is done rather than *how* it's done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

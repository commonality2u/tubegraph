The Airsoft rotisserie chicken method offers an unconventional yet surprisingly easy way to cook chicken at home, resulting in crispy skin and potatoes fried in chicken fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method is efficient for cooking multiple chickens simultaneously, ideal for feeding a crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Ingredients and Preparation

### Chicken Selection
Start with a four to five-pound chicken; larger chickens may lead to burned potatoes by the time the chicken is cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Seasoning
Apply a generous amount of salt, followed by garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These spices are classic for grocery store rotisserie chickens in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Smush the seasoning around, then flip and repeat on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Excess seasoning falling onto the pan is fine, as potatoes will eventually be cooked there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Stick half a lemon inside each chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Optional Dry Curing
While chickens can be roasted immediately, placing them uncovered on a rack in the fridge for one to two days allows for [[seasoning_and_dry_curing_chicken | dry curing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This process ensures air circulation, drying out the skin for crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Unlike traditional [[seasoning_and_dry_curing_chicken | seasoning]], dry curing helps season the interior of the meat, as salt draws out moisture, dissolves into it, and is then reabsorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Tying the Chicken
For [[tying_and_hanging_chicken_for_roasting | tying the chicken]], use about three feet (or one meter) of butcher's twine per chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
1.  Nestle the middle of the string underneath the chicken, along its spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
2.  Bring one end of the string up along the breast, seating it in the natural depression over the keel bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
3.  Wrap the two ends of the string around each other once or twice over the bird's rear end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
4.  Tie the two legs together, ideally with one knee joint laid on top of the other for more security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. A butcher's knot can be used, but any secure knot is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

> [!warning] Critical Tying Step
> Ensure the supporting string wraps all the way down around the breast. Skipping this step can lead to the chicken falling apart in the oven as the dark meat softens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Hanging and Oven Setup

### Hanging the Chicken
Use large metal S-hooks (e.g., bent from a wire coat hanger) to hang the chickens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Hook the S-hook through the chicken's tied legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

> [!warning] Hook Placement
> Hook the chicken *between its tied legs* and *not* on the string suspended over the cavity, as the latter is not strong enough and will break, causing the chicken to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. The legs are a stronger point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Oven Configuration
If your oven has three racks, remove one. Place one rack in the top position and another in the bottom position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Use a convection roast setting at 425°F (220°C), but be prepared to experiment with your specific oven, as every oven is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Convection is highly recommended for this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Potatoes Preparation
Use three pounds (or 1.5 kg) of floury baking potatoes, such as russets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Peel them if you prefer, as russet skins can be unpleasant unless exposed to exclusively dry heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Any large potato that can be cut into big chunks will work, but mealy potatoes absorb chicken goodness better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Cut them into very thick slices, about 1.5 inches (4 cm), as they will shrink considerably during cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Discard any small pieces to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Cooking Process

1.  **Probe Thermometer**: Insert a probe thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken breast *before* hanging, being careful to avoid bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
2.  **Boil Potatoes (Optional)**: Briefly boil the potatoes for a browner skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
3.  **Pan Setup**: Place the potatoes evenly spaced in a single layer on a pre-seasoned sheet pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
4.  **Initial Placement**: Slide the pan onto the low rack in the oven, then hook the chicken onto a bar of the upper rack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The tautness of the pulled legs can help the dark meat cook faster, addressing the common challenge of [[roasting_chicken_techniques | roasting chickens]] where white meat cooks before dark meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
5.  **Add Liquid**: Pour a thin layer of stock or water into the pan with the potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This prevents the potatoes from cooking too fast and stops drippings from causing smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
6.  **Monitor and Rotate**: Check every 15 minutes and shift the pan to ensure all potatoes receive direct chicken drippings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Rotate the pan if your oven is uneven to distribute the liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Doneness and Resting

After about an hour of [[roasting_chicken_techniques | roasting]], the internal temperature of the chicken should be around 162°F (72°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. It will reach a perfect 165°F (74°C) as it rests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

1.  **Remove Chicken**: Use an oven mitt to unhook the hot chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
2.  **Remove Potatoes**: Take the pan of potatoes out of the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
3.  **Crisp Potatoes**: While the oven is still hot and chickens are resting, use a stout metal spatula to scrape and flip the potatoes, then return them to the upper rack for direct heat to crisp the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. It's fine if they get beat up, as the roughed-up surfaces crisp beautifully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
4.  **Resting**: Rest the chickens on a clean rack to keep the bottom skin dry and crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Rest the potatoes alongside the chickens to firm up before serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Serving

To [[how_to_cut_up_a_whole_chicken_for_frying | chop up a chicken]], tear off the whole leg quarter, lop off the entire breast, cut the leg off the thigh, and slice the breast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The crispy skin on the underside of the leg and thigh is a unique benefit of this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Serve a mixture of light and dark meat with the chicken-fat fried potatoes, which resemble a crude fondant potato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. A side salad with an acidic dressing helps cut the richness of the chicken fat in the potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The potatoes may or may not need finishing salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

> [!info] Tip
> Since this method doesn't produce pan sauce or gravy, the [[seasoning_and_dry_curing_chicken | dry brining]] step helps flavor the meat on the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

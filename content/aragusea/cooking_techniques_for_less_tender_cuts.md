From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

While expensive, tender cuts like ribeye are popular, many less tender cuts offer significantly more flavor and can be made easily edible with specific knife work and [[cooking_techniques | cooking techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This specialized preparation can occur either before, after, or both before and after cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

Common less tender cuts discussed include:
*   Hanger steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Short rib (which can be prepared as a steak) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>
*   Skirt steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

These cuts are often called "butcher's cuts" because butchers historically kept them for themselves due to their knowledge of how to prepare them and their superior flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## General Principles for Less Tender Cuts

Unlike traditional steaks (single-serving cuts sliced against the grain for short meat fibers), these less tender cuts often come from thinner muscles like the belly, making it impossible to cut them against the grain into steaks initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This necessitates specialized treatment from the cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Grain Structure and Marinades
The prominent, coarse grain structure of these cuts makes them very good at absorbing marinades, possibly due to the extra surface area offered by the ridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Fat Rendering
Many of these cuts, like skirt steak, are very fatty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It is often recommended not to trim this fat, but instead to cook the meat until most of the fat has deliciously melted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Cooking fattier cuts to a medium or medium-well doneness can give the fat more time to render, providing moisture to the steak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Skirt Steak

The outside skirt steak is considered superior to the inside skirt steak, being much more tender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. It comes from around the belly of the animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Preparation
1.  **Cut into Shorter Pieces**: Cut the steak into pieces as wide as your pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This allows for dividing the meat into pieces of similar thickness, enabling each segment to cook for its optimal time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
2.  **Trimming**:
    *   Trim off any very tough membrane or sheet of connective tissue that feels like a rubber band coating the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   An inconsequentially thin membrane does not need to be trimmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   Generally, don't trim the fat; it contributes to the strong, beautiful flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
3.  **Seasoning**: Use salt and pepper, but go easy on the salt due to the meat's thinness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Use minimal oil as the meat is already fatty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Cooking
*   **Heat**: Use very intense heat for thin steaks like skirt steak to achieve a golden crust before the inside overcooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. However, avoid cranking the stove to its highest setting; adjust heat based on your specific stove to prevent burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Placement**: Place thicker, longer-cooking pieces along the cooler edges of the pan, and thinner pieces in the super-hot center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Flipping**: Employ constant flipping, every 30 seconds or so, to gradually build a crust and ensure even [[cooking_techniques | cooking techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Doneness**:
    *   For very thin pieces, pull them when they are still quite raw on the inside, as carryover cooking is pronounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   Outside skirt steak can be cooked to medium or even medium-well because it is tender enough to handle it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This allows the fat to render and melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Look for plenty of pink juice pushing out of the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Resting**: Allow the steak to rest for a few minutes after cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Slicing
This is a crucial step: you *must* cut a skirt steak across the meat fibers (against the grain) or it will be inedibly chewy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Slicing very thin against the grain results in short meat fibers that pull apart effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Pairing
Skirt steak has a strong beef flavor and typically needs no marinade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. A common accompaniment is chimichurri, a South American pesto-like sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

#### Chimichurri Ingredients and Preparation
*   **Garlic**: A couple of cloves, not too many, as raw garlic is very strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Fresh Herbs**: Traditionally parsley and oregano, but cilantro can be substituted for oregano <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Chili**: Fresh red chili is common, but dried can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Seasoning**: Pinch of salt, a little pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Olive Oil**: Enough to form a sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Avoid using a food processor with olive oil, as it can go bitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Acid**: A splash of red wine vinegar is traditional, but lime juice can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. It's not a vinaigrette, so use less acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Preparation**: Chop all ingredients finely by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Merging Flavors**: Allow the chimichurri to sit for a few hours or overnight for the flavors to merge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Short Rib

Short ribs are intercostal muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. They are often known as an excellent cut for [[braising_methods_for_beef | braising methods for beef]] due to their heavy marbling and high connective tissue content around the bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. However, the bulk of the meat itself has surprisingly little connective tissue, making it shockingly tender when cooked correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The meatiest English-cut short ribs typically come from the chuck or rib section, extending from the rib roast or ribeye steak, contributing to their tenderness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Butterflying Techniques
To transform a short rib into a wide, flat steak, you need to butterfly it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

1.  **"Book" Method**:
    *   Locate the bone, which is usually slightly off-center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
    *   Cut down along the bone as close as possible, stopping just before going all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   Open the meat like a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. The thicker flap of meat makes a better hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    *   Cut the thicker side of the "book" to half its current thickness, again stopping before going all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   Open it up, and make a few shallow slices to help it lay as flat as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

2.  **Accordion Cutting**:
    *   Cut down along the bone as before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   Flip the meat around and make another cut straight down, but not all the way through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    *   Unfurl the meat like an accordion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This method can be easier for more cuts, such as for super-thin Korean-style short ribs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Cooking
*   **Seasoning**: Salt, pepper, and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Heat**: Since it's a thick steak, it needs less heat (e.g., medium heat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Flipping**: Flip every 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Pressing**: After the first flip, consider applying a culinary brick (a foil-wrapped brick) to ensure even contact with the pan surface, especially as butterfly cuts may tent up around the hinges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This helps achieve thorough crust formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Doneness**: Aim for medium doneness rather than medium-rare to allow the abundant fat to melt sufficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Look for lots of pink juice pooling on the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Slicing
After resting, slice the short rib thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. While you can try to slice against the grain, butterflying often results in a grain running in multiple directions, so do your best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. A finishing salt, like smoked sea salt, can enhance the flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Hanger Steak

Also known as "butcher's steak," the hanger steak has an extremely beefy taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. It comes from just above the diaphragm of the animal, above the brisket on the top side, hence its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. There is only one hanger steak per animal, making it harder to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

### Preparation (Home Butchery)
1.  **Trim Silver Skin**: This rubber band-like connective tissue will not melt during cooking and must be trimmed off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. A thin knife can help slip under the silver skin and shave it off with minimal meat removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. It helps to start a strip and then pull up on it while shaving through the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Avoid trimming the delicious fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
2.  **Remove Central Connective Tissue**: There is a very chewy band of connective tissue running straight through the middle of the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. While it can be removed after cooking, it's preferable to remove it beforehand to cook the two resulting sides individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
    *   Separate the two halves by slowly unzipping the meat along the seam of this connective tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
    *   The two halves are not the same size; one side is typically much bigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
3.  **Cut into Portions/Steaks**:
    *   The smaller half can be cut in half and pan-roasted like tenderloins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This also helps them fit in the pan and creates pieces of more consistent thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
    *   The bigger side can be butterflied into thinner steaks (similar to French bistro "onglet" for steak frites) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This can involve cutting off a hanging part, then butterflying it, and then cutting the main piece into multiple portions, butterflying each to half its thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### Cooking
*   **Seasoning**: Salt, pepper, and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Heat**: For thinner steaks, a hot cast iron pan (oil just starting to smoke) is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. For thicker, loin-like pieces, use lower heat (medium-low) to cook more gently and avoid burning the fond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Flipping**: Constant flipping (every 30 seconds) promotes more even [[cooking_techniques | cooking techniques]] and allows for immediate adjustment of heat if burning occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   **Basting**: For thicker pieces, after building a crust, add butter and continuously flip the meat in it to create a roasting environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Doneness**:
    *   Visually, look for pink juice pooling in the grooves of the coarse grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. A good amount indicates medium-rare to medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
    *   For thicker cuts, a thermometer can be used, or use the "poke and peek" method (snip with scissors to check doneness, easier than a knife in the pan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Remember carryover cooking; meat continues to cook while resting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   **Resting**: Let the meat rest after cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

### Slicing
Slice thin against the grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Slice on the bias (at a shallow angle) to get prettier, wider slices instead of thin strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### Pan Sauce
Hanger steak's coarse grain structure makes it excellent for holding onto a pan sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Pan sauces are more suitable for thicker cuts cooked at lower heat, as this prevents the fond from burning, which would make the sauce taste bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

#### Pan Sauce Ingredients and Preparation
1.  **Sauté Shallots**: Cook finely chopped shallots in the pan until brown and soft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Shallots are classic for pan sauces because their thin layers cook quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
2.  **Deglaze**: Deglaze the pan with red wine, scraping the fond with a wooden spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. If avoiding wine, use water followed by a splash of balsamic vinegar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
3.  **Add Demi-Glace (Optional)**: If available, add demi-glace for richness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
4.  **Reduce/Adjust**: If the sauce is over-reduced, add water instead of more wine, as too much reduced red wine can become bitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
5.  **Mount with Butter**: Turn off the heat and, once bubbling has stopped, stir in butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. Mixing butter into a sauce off the boil creates a thick, luscious emulsion; boiling would cause the butter to separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. If no demi-glace, use more butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
6.  **Add Meat Juices**: Pour the juices from the resting board into the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.
7.  **Fresh Herbs (Optional)**: Tear some parsley into the sauce at the last second; residual heat will wilt it without browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

By employing these [[cooking_techniques | cooking techniques]] and specialized knife work, less tender cuts can yield incredibly flavorful and delicious results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

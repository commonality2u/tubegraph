This article details the process of [[pizza_dough_preparation | preparing pizza dough]] for a New York-style pizza at home, emphasizing a long, cold rise for optimal flavor and texture. The recipe yields enough dough for four 12-13 inch pizzas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Dough Preparation

The process for [[pizza_dough_ingredients_and_preparation | pizza dough ingredients and preparation]] begins with blooming the yeast and then combining the rest of the ingredients for mixing and kneading.

### Ingredients

*   Yeast: 1 teaspoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   Sugar: 1 teaspoon (initial bloom) + 1 tablespoon (main mix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   Warm Water: ¼ cup (initial bloom) + 2 cups (main mix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Salt: 1 tablespoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   Olive Oil: ¼ cup (at most) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   Bread Flour (high protein flour): 5 cups to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

### Steps

1.  **Bloom the Yeast**: Combine 1 teaspoon of yeast, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and ¼ cup of warm water. Wait five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This step is done to confirm the yeast is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
2.  **Combine Ingredients**: Add 2 more cups of warm water, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of salt, and approximately ¼ cup of olive oil to the yeast mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
3.  **Add Flour**: Begin with 5 cups of bread flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
4.  **Knead the Dough**: Use a mixer with a dough hook attachment to knead the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Continue kneading until it forms a reasonably smooth, solid mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The dough should be only slightly sticky; add more flour if it is too sticky, as 5 cups is a conservative amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The dough is sufficiently kneaded when a small piece can be stretched so thin that light can be seen through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Portioning and Shaping

After kneading, the dough is portioned and shaped before its cold rise.

1.  **Divide the Dough**: The recipe yields enough dough for four 12-13 inch pizzas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Rip the dough into four equal chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  **Form Balls**: Roll each dough chunk into a smooth, even ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The shape of these balls matters significantly for an even rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
3.  **Prepare Containers**: Place each dough ball in its own oiled container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Toss the ball around in the oil, then use the oil to grease the sides of the bowl or container. This ensures the ball rises in an even, round shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Cold Rise Method

This [[pizza_dough_preparation_and_cold_rise_method | cold rise method]] is crucial for flavor and texture in New York-style pizza dough.

*   **Refrigeration**: Cover the dough balls and place them in the refrigerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Duration**: A long, slow rise in the fridge leads to the best flavor and texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The bare minimum is 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The preferred duration is 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, but the dough can be aged for a whole week, which makes it taste almost like sourdough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Handling the Dough for Baking

Proper [[preparing_and_handling_pizza_dough | preparing and handling pizza dough]] just before baking is key to a successful pizza.

*   **Orientation**: When ready to stretch, the smooth top of the dough ball (which was initially the bottom in the oiled container) should become the bottom of the pizza, as it slides off the peel more cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The rough underside will become the top, adhering better to sauce and cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Forming the Cornicione (Crust)**: Start by gently forming the "cornice" or the fluffy outer ring of crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Never smash it down, or it will not fluff up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Stretching the Dough**: Stretch the dough by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. While tossing it in the air is possible, hand-stretching is sufficient for a single pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The dough is thin enough when light can be seen through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Working on the Peel**: Once the stretched dough is laid on the pizza peel, work quickly. If the dough sits too long, it can bond to the wood and become impossible to slide into the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Checking for Release**: Before transferring to the oven, pick up the peel and shake it back and forth to ensure the pizza will release cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Confidence is key in this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Homemade Pizza Bread (Bonus)

Using one of the aged dough balls, a "pizza bread" can be made:

1.  **Flatten Dough**: Use a dough ball aged in a wide container, allowing it to spread out nice and flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The spongy, bubbly surface will become very crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
2.  **Stretch**: Gently stretch it into a big oval, with the bottom of the aged dough becoming the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
3.  **Season**: Smear olive oil onto the porous surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Add pepper, coarse salt, and garlic powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
4.  **Bake**: Bake in the oven just like the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. It's ready when the top just starts to color; very light brown is enough as garlic powder burns easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
5.  **Serve**: Cut into strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

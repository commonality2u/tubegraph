From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

There are various methods for making ice cream without an ice cream maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The [[two_bowls_method_for_making_ice_cream | two bowls method]] is a favored technique due to its ease, lack of special equipment requirements, and ability to yield several pints of ice cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This method can be used for both [[homemade_ice_cream_making_techniques | Philadelphia]] and French style ice creams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Philadelphia Style Ice Cream

Philadelphia style ice cream is considered the easiest and purest form of ice cream, made from sugar, cream, and milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It does not contain eggs or require pre-cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Ingredients and Preparation
*   **Base:** Typically made with a pint (2 cups / 475 ml) of cream and one cup (235 ml) of milk, plus three-quarters of a cup (150 grams) of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Enhancements:** Can be significantly improved by using evaporated milk instead of regular milk, as its higher protein content contributes to a smoother texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Adding dried milk powder is an alternative way to achieve a similar result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. A "huge glug" of vanilla can be added for flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Mixing:** The ingredients are combined in the inner bowl of the [[two_bowls_method_for_making_ice_cream | two bowls ice bath setup]] and beaten with a hand mixer on the lowest setting for eight to ten minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This process initially makes the mixture fluffy like whipped cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Texture:** After hardening, it provides a texture comparable to traditionally churned ice cream, with a simple and good taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## French Style Ice Cream (Frozen Custard)

French style ice cream is actually a frozen custard, distinguished by the inclusion of egg yolks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Ingredients and Preparation
*   **Base:** Made with six egg yolks, three-quarters of a cup of sugar (split), a pint of cream, a pinch of salt, vanilla, and a cup of cold milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The protein from the yolks makes evaporated milk unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Custard Method:**
    1.  Half the sugar is whisked into the egg yolks to smooth them and help prevent curdling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    2.  The remaining sugar, cream, and salt are brought to a simmer in a pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    3.  The simmering cream mixture is slowly drizzled into the egg yolks while whisking to prevent curdling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    4.  The entire mixture returns to the pot and simmers for a few more minutes until it thickens slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    5.  Vanilla and cold milk are stirred in off the heat, with the cold milk helping to cool the mixture faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
    6.  The custard is strained to remove any "chunkies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
    7.  The custard must be cooled completely for many hours in advance before churning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Texture:** French style ice cream is noticeably denser and smoother than Philadelphia style due to the egg yolks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Incorporating Fruit (Peaches)
When incorporating fruits into ice cream, such as peaches, it's beneficial to peel them as the skins can taste "papery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
1.  Chop the fruit and mix with sugar and a little lime juice; the acid prevents browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
2.  Allow the mixture to sit for about an hour for the sugar to break down the fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
3.  Smash the fruit with a fork into a coarse grind; chunks larger than this will freeze solid and hard like pebbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
4.  Before churning, squeeze as much juice as possible from the fruit pulp into the ice cream mix, as the mix needs to be churned with most of its water already inside to prevent the juice from freezing hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
5.  Fruit solids or other mix-ins like chocolate chips or cookie crumbs are stirred in at the end, after the ice cream has been beaten and deflated in the second phase of the [[two_bowls_method_for_making_ice_cream | two bowls method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Comparison and Considerations
*   **Workload:** French style ice cream is "a lot more work" than Philadelphia style due to the custard preparation and cooling time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Preference:** The choice between Philadelphia and French style often comes down to personal preference, as the resulting texture and flavor profiles differ significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Homemade Advantage:** A primary reason to make ice cream at home is the ability to create a pure product with just a few ingredients, which is rare to buy commercially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Another reason is to incorporate special ingredients like fresh fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

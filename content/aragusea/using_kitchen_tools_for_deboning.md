[[Deboning a turkey]] can simplify the cooking process, allowing for easier slicing and more consistent cooking of different meat types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This method also allows all the hard work to be done in advance of a holiday feast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Recommended Kitchen Tools for Deboning

To de-bone a turkey, you will need a few essential [[kitchen_tools]]:
*   **Kitchen scissors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   **Boning knife** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> (or any really sharp knife) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   **Pliers** (specifically for removing large tendons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>

## Steps for Deboning the Main Carcass

The process begins by flipping the bird to expose its backbone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The skeleton protrudes in four main areas: the shoulder joints and the hip joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Beyond these, the meat generally sits on top of the bones and can be peeled off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Deboning Techniques

1.  **Cutting along the Spine:** Cut straight down along one side of the spine, allowing the knife to follow the bones and slowly peel the meat off the central skeleton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
2.  **Dislocating Hip Joints:**
    *   Use [[kitchen_tools | kitchen scissors]] to get around the hip joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   Grip down and twist hard to dislocate the joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   Once opened, use the scissors to snip away at the ligaments connecting the femur to the pelvic girdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
3.  **Dislocating Shoulder Joints:** Apply the exact same method as for the hip joint, using scissors to twist and lever the joint apart, then snipping or cutting the ligaments attaching the humerus to the scapula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For a large turkey, you can sometimes dislocate the wing or shoulder joint by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, then use a knife to cut through any remaining tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
4.  **Peeling Rib and Breast Meat:** Continue peeling meat off the ribs, making small slices and following the bones with the knife until reaching the sternum (breastbone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
5.  **Finishing the Carcass:** Once one side is free, rotate the bird and repeat the process on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Finally, peel the meat off the sternum and break off the wishbone to free the central skeleton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Deboning Legs, Thighs, and Wings

### Legs and Thighs
[[Steps for deboning chicken thighs | Deboning leg and thigh bones]] involves:
1.  Cutting straight down to the thigh bone and peeling meat off the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
2.  Slipping the knife in and under, sawing out toward where the hip was to free the end of the femur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
3.  Repeating this process for the knee and shin bone (tibia), cutting down its length and peeling meat off the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
4.  Levering those bones over once around the ankle, using scissors to snip off any remaining connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
5.  Removing tendons: On a large turkey, tendons in the leg are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Use pliers to grab the end of the tendon, hold the meat back, and pull hard to extract them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Wings
Wings can be cut off whole and saved for sauce as they don't have much meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. For the upper portion (drumette), cut straight down along the humerus and peel the meat off the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Post-Deboning Preparation

After deboning, inspect the meat for any remaining cartilage or blubbery fat and trim them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Fold back the pectoralis minor muscles (poultry tenderloin) to ensure a more even thickness for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Butterfly the thickest part of the breast with one or two shallow cuts to help it cook more evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Important Note on Anatomy
Consider breaking down a few whole chickens (cooked and raw) to gain basic knowledge of bird anatomy before attempting a full turkey deboning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Benefits of Deboning

Deboning a turkey in advance makes the holiday feast day significantly less stressful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
*   **Easier Slicing:** The boneless meat can be sliced directly on the board without working around a rib cage or bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   **Consistent Cooking:** Separating dark and white meat allows for independent control over cooking temperatures, ensuring both are cooked to their ideal doneness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Crispy Skin:** Air-drying the deboned skin in the fridge results in incredibly crisp and tasty skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, unlike the often soggy skin of bone-in dark meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Fully Edible Slices:** With tendons removed, every slice of dark meat is completely clean and edible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   **Sauce Ingredients:** All bones, neck, giblets, and trimmings are excellent for making a delicious gravy or demi-glace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

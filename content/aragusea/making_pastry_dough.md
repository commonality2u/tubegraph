The highest purpose of any leftover roast bird is to be baked into a chicken pot pie, or as the British say, "chicken pie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The first step in making this dish is to [[tips for a flaky pie crust | make some pastry dough]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This dough requires chilling in the fridge before it can be rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Ingredients and Initial Preparation

For the pastry dough, you will need:
*   Two cups of flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   Half a teaspoon of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   One stick of cold, salted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>

Cut the cold butter into small chunks before adding it to a food processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. If the butter is not cold, it will melt in the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, and if it's not cut into chunks, it will just spin around in a big glob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The goal is to have many tiny, solid globs of butter because when these are rolled out later, they will create a flaky crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Mixing the Dough

Traditionally, just enough cold water would be added to bring the mixture together into a dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, using white wine instead of water in the crust can make it a little sweet and fragrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Add about a tablespoon of wine at a time to the food processor, whizzing it up and checking the texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The dough should look dry but be squishable into a small flake in your fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This typically requires only three or four tablespoons of wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Chilling and Handling

Dump the dough mixture out onto plastic wrap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Barely bring it together into a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. It won't feel completely right, but the less it is worked at this stage, the more crumbly and flaky the crust will be later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Wrap the dough and place it in the fridge to chill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Rolling the Pastry

When ready to use, flour your work surface and the top of the pastry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Roll a little, then turn the dough, and repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Turning ensures it doesn't stick and helps to roll it more evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The dough may seem like it's breaking apart initially, but as it warms and the tiny butter beads stretch into sheets, it will start to look and feel like actual dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

If a hole opens up, grab some excess dough from another corner and perform a "skin graft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Continue rolling, and everything will smush together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. If the pastry is hard to roll out, this is a good sign that it will be crumbly and flaky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

To check the dimensions, compare it to your pie dish (a 2.5 to 3-quart dish is suitable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. You want at least an inch of excess pastry on all sides to help form a seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, and these overhanging parts will become deliciously crunchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Finishing and Baking

Crack an egg into a bowl, whisk it smooth with some water to create an egg wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Use a pastry brush to smear this egg wash around the edge of the pie dish; this will glue the crust to the dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

Gently drape the rolled pastry over the pie filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Quickly, before it starts to melt, brush egg wash over the entire top of the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This helps the crust brown and makes it shiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. While some people pierce holes in the crust to release steam, often one or two will open up by themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Place the pie in a preheated oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. It's advisable to place aluminum foil or another tray underneath to catch any sauce that boils over or pieces of crust that drop off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

The finished crust should exhibit many nice flakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. If the dough had been easier to work with, it would result in a solid and chewy crust, rather than a flaky and crumbly one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

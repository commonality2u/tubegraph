Making garlic knots is a classic use for leftover pizza dough, transforming it into a delicious appetizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This method uses dough that has been [[aging_pizza_dough | cold fermented]] in the fridge for several days, possibly up to a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Dough Preparation for Knots

To begin, gently pull the dough away from its container edges to lift it out, trying to deflate it as little as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
1.  **Shape and Slice**: Try to form the dough into a reasonably even rectangle, then slice it into strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
2.  **Sizing**: The knots will double in size during baking, so consider cutting strips in half for smaller knots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
3.  **Lubrication**: If the dough is sticky, lubricate your hands with water, flour, or oil, depending on the desired finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For a crispy brown crust, working the dough with oil on your hands is recommended, as oil aids in achieving this finish in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Tying the Knots

There are multiple ways to tie garlic knots:
*   **Simple Knot**: Take a strip, cross the ends over, and send one end up through the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Restaurant Method**: Pick up a strip, wrap it around two fingers twice, and then send the excess through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Board Method**: If unsure, perform the knotting on a board by crossing two ends over and sending one end through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
    *   **Finishing the Ends**: The other end can be left dangling for a darker, crispier texture contrast, or tucked under for a softer knot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    *   **Placement**: Place the shaped knots directly onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Proofing and Baking

1.  **Proofing**: Allow the knots to proof for about half an hour to give the yeast time to rise them one last time in their final shape, which helps them bake up airy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The oil coating should prevent them from drying out during this time, so covering is not necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
2.  **Baking**: Bake the knots dry (without pre-coating) at 400°F (200°C) for approximately 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   **Doneness**: Some prefer them just set and pale for soft knots, but for a classic appetizer, bake them until quite brown. They may seem hard at this stage, but they will soften <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Baking them harder initially helps prevent them from becoming mushy when soaking in butter or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## [[preparing_garlic_bread | Garlic Butter]] Coating

While the knots bake, prepare the coating:
1.  **Ingredients**: You'll need about half a head of garlic, a large handful of fresh parsley, and a stick of butter (or olive oil, as preferred) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
2.  **Process**:
    *   Melt butter (or heat olive oil) over medium-high heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   Scrape in the chopped garlic and immediately turn off the heat; the garlic does not need to cook much and should not burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
    *   Add seasonings like pepper, chili flakes, and dried oregano <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Hold off on fresh parsley and salt for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Finishing the Garlic Knots

1.  **Coat**: Transfer the baked knots to a bowl while still warm and pour in most of the seasoned butter/oil, reserving a little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Stir for about a minute to allow absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Add Cheese and Parsley**: Grate in some cheese (e.g., Parmesan) now to prevent it from getting too hot and grainy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Add the fresh parsley after the temperature has cooled slightly to keep it green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
3.  **Season with Salt**: The knots may need more salt, especially if unsalted butter was used; the butter will help the salt stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

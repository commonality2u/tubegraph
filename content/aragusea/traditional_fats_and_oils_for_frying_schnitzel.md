Schnitzel, particularly Wieneerschnitzel, is an iconic dish of Vienna that is simple yet very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The home frying of schnitzel can be achieved with very little oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Various fats are used for frying different types of schnitzels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Clarified Butter (Butter Schmaltz)
[[Clarified butter and its role in cooking schnitzel | Clarified butter]] is one of the traditional fats for frying schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. It can be purchased or made at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

To make clarified butter:
1.  Melt half a pound (or a quarter kilo) of butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
2.  Allow it to boil for a long time, which can take almost half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. During this process, milk proteins will rise to the top, while sugars and water sink to the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
3.  The bubbling will slow down significantly when most of the water is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
4.  Traditional Germanic clarified butter (butter schmaltz) typically stops here, before browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Indian ghee, however, involves letting it brown a little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
5.  Strain the butter through a strainer with a paper towel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. For best results, strain it again when pouring into the frying pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This ensures that any remaining milk solids, which would burn during frying, are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

The result is pure butter fat with no protein or sugar that would burn, and no water that would burst and pop at medium-high heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The taste of clarified butter is a dominant flavor in schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Lard
Lard is another traditional fat used for frying schnitzel, particularly for [[preparing_different_types_of_schnitzel_veal_chicken_and_pork | pork schnitzel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. A few spoonfuls melt quickly in a hot pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. However, using lard will give the pork a strong "pig" taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Vegetable Oil
A neutral frying oil, such as vegetable oil, is also acceptable for frying any schnitzel, including [[preparing_different_types_of_schnitzel_veal_chicken_and_pork | chicken schnitzel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Frying Temperature and Technique
To test the oil temperature, dip the meat's "toes" into the oil; if it sizzles a lot, it's ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The schnitzel should be "swimming in the fat," meaning there's enough fat for the meat to float above the pan's surface, but not so much that it's submerged (which would be deep frying) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

It is recommended to flip the schnitzels multiple times, almost constantly, while cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This technique helps the schnitzel cook more evenly and prevents burning by allowing for continuous assessment and adjustment of the heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

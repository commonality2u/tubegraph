Food preservation methods have been crucial throughout human history, allowing communities to store food for longer periods and ensuring survival, especially during lean times. Early methods often focused on drying, salting, and smoking.

## Smoking

Smoking is a preservation method that both physically and chemically preserves food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It also imparts a desirable flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Origins
Evidence suggests that Neolithic people smoked the animals they hunted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, likely using simple setups such as tripods of sticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Historically, smoke was most useful for preserving meat due to its high pathogen load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Ancient people likely discovered smoking through observation:
*   They noticed that food dried by the fire tasted better and lasted longer than food dried in the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   They observed that bugs did not like smoke, which impedes their respiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, and used fire to keep insects away from drying food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Smoking Techniques

There are two basic types of smoking: [[cooking_techniques | hot smoking]] and [[cooking_techniques | cold smoking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

*   **[[cooking_techniques | Hot smoking]]**: This involves smoking at temperatures above 160째F (70째C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. In a moist environment, the connective tissue collagen breaks down, and the meat braises in its own internal water, becoming fall-apart tender before it dries out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. American-style barbecue is an example of hot smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Hot smoking is primarily for flavor and cooking, not for preservation, as the food remains too wet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **[[cooking_techniques | Cold smoking]]**: This is the method used for preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. It is generally defined as smoking below 85째F (30째C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, as warmer temperatures can cause fat to melt out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Cold smoking results in products like beef jerky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. It chiefly preserves food by drying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
    *   A common issue in [[cooking_techniques | hot smoking]] in a dry environment or poorly controlled [[cooking_techniques | cold smoking]] is case hardening, where the outer layer of meat dries too quickly, trapping moisture inside and allowing microbial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Chemical Properties of Smoke
[[chemical_properties_of_wood_smoke_in_food_preservation | Smoke contains chemicals]] that help preserve food and contribute to its flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Liquid smoke, which is actual smoke condensed into a water-based liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, has shown antimicrobial effects against bacteria like E. coli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
Key chemicals include:
*   **Phenols**: These disrupt the cell membranes of bacteria, causing them to leak and die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Carbonyls**: These bond with amino acids in proteins, deactivating enzymes essential for bacterial function. They also bond with environmental amino acids that bacteria need for food, effectively ruining their food supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

Smoke also contributes to the characteristic pink color of cured and smoked meats (like barbecue or cured ham) through the action of carbon monoxide and, more significantly, nitric oxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Nitric oxide forms a strong bond with myoglobin, stabilizing the protein and making it less likely to change color and turn brown during cooking or prolonged air exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Hazards of Smoking
Direct smoking over a fire can result in higher levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are carcinogenic compounds found in smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Modern commercial smoking often uses indirect methods, where smoke is funneled through a pipe and cooled to remove some PAHs before reaching the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

Historically, people may not have realized the long-term health hazards, or they faced more immediate survival threats like starvation, making the risks of smoked food secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

## Drying

Drying is considered the oldest food preservation method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. It can be done by simply cutting food into small pieces and leaving it in the hot sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. When sun-drying isn't feasible (e.g., due to rain, dense forest, or living in a cave), drying by fire is an alternative, as fire provides warm, dry, moving air suitable for drying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Salt Curing

Salt curing is generally considered more effective than smoking for food preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Salt curing often precedes smoking to enhance safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Salting works by pulling water out of the food through osmosis and creating an environment (high salt, low water) that is hostile to microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

However, many ancient people would not have had access to added salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, making their smoked meat less safe than modern methods that combine salting with smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Combined Methods
Salting and smoking both work better if the food is cut thinly to increase surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
When cold smoking, maintaining the meat in the bacterial danger zone (temperatures warm enough for microbial growth but not hot enough to kill them) is a hazard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This is why a salt cure before cold smoking is the safest bet, as salt chemically kills microbes and removes water, reducing drying time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Limitations
While salt and smoke are effective, they are not foolproof. For example, *Listeria* bacteria are notably resistant to smoke, salt, and acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Unlike other common foodborne pathogens, *Listeria* can multiply at refrigerator temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. The only sure-fire way to kill *Listeria* in food is to cook it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Cold-smoked meat, being uncooked, has been implicated in *Listeria* outbreaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Cooking Dried and Smoked Meat

Once ancient people invented water-safe [[history_of_cast_iron_cookware | cooking vessels]], they could rehydrate and cook dried and smoked meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This involved simmering chunks of the leathery meat with grains, roots, and greens to create a stew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Cooking makes the meat fall-apart tender and also distributes the salt from the cure throughout the broth, seasoning the entire dish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. This final cooking step would also ensure the destruction of pathogens like *Listeria*.

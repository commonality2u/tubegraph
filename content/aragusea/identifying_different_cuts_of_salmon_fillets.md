Salmon is often considered a forgiving fish to [[how_to_cook_salmon_fillets_perfectly | cook]], tolerating various doneness levels from raw to slightly overcooked due to its high fat content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. When purchasing salmon, fillets are a common choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Choosing Salmon: Farmed vs. Wild

One of the first decisions when buying salmon fillets is between [[farmed_versus_wild_salmon | farmed and wild salmon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. They can be distinguished by several characteristics:

*   **Color**:
    *   **Farmed salmon** typically has a pale orange color, reminiscent of a creamsicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Its flesh would naturally be gray if farmers didn't add astaxanthin, a pigment, to their feed to achieve a more appealing color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   **Wild salmon**, especially sockeye salmon, exhibits a more intense, reddish color, comparable to the inside of a blood orange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Wild salmon naturally obtain astaxanthin from the crustaceans they consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Fat Content**:
    *   **Farmed salmon** often has a higher fat content, visible as white ribbons running through the meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Wild salmon** is arguably superior in the *type* of fat it contains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Both types of salmon contain a mix of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Wild salmon provides a more beneficial ratio, with more omega-3s and less omega-6s, which is generally healthier for most people consuming a standard Western diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Most wild salmon, unless sourced directly from a fishery, will have been frozen, which is common practice due to the seasonal nature of salmon harvests. Modern flash-freezing techniques are highly effective at preserving quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Fillet Shapes and Characteristics

Salmon fillets are categorized into three basic shapes depending on their origin on the whole side of the fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>:

1.  **Car Shape**: These pieces resemble a small hatchback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. They are often preferred for their uneven thickness, which allows for a variety of doneness levels within a single portion â€“ from rare to well-done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The thinnest part of a car piece comes from the belly, which is fattier and can be well-cooked without drying out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
2.  **Flat Pieces**: These are thinner and more even in thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Their consistent thickness ensures they cook more evenly, making them suitable for methods like broiling or when a uniform cooked texture is desired, such as with a mashed potato crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
3.  **Tail Pieces**: Identifiable by their taper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Like flat pieces, tail pieces tend to have a pretty even thickness, facilitating even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Pre-Cooking Preparations

*   **Pin Bones**: While fillets are cut off the bone, they commonly contain a few small pin bones that need to be removed. These can be seen poking up and can be pulled out with fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Processors typically remove most of them, but some are often missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Skin**: The scales are usually removed, and many people eat the skin. However, it is significantly easier to remove the skin after the fish has been cooked, unless skinless chunks are specifically needed for a dish like a fish pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Cooked skin can become crispy and is enjoyed by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Nutritional Benefits of Salmon

Wild salmon is highly nutritious, known for its high omega-3 to omega-6 ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. It is also naturally rich in astaxanthin, which may offer additional health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Bristol Bay sockeye salmon, for instance, is noted for being part of the largest and most sustainable wild salmon run globally, with a significant portion of wild sockeye in the U.S. originating from this region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

This article outlines a specific method for [[pizza_dough_preparation]] and handling to achieve a brown, crispy pizza bottom in a home oven using only the broiler, without a pizza stone or steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This technique is quick and results in a very tasty pizza, though slightly different from a traditional pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Dough Preparation and Cold Rise

The method uses a standard pizza dough recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. After mixing, the dough is portioned into balls and placed directly into the refrigerator for a [[pizza_dough_preparation_and_cold_rise_method | cold rise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This cold rise should last at least one day and can extend up to a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Handling Cold Dough

It is crucial to work with the dough straight out of the refrigerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. The colder the dough is when it enters the oven, the better the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### Shaping the Dough

*   **Flouring**: Apply a little flour to both sides of the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Rolling vs. Stretching**: For this baking method, it is recommended to use a rolling pin rather than stretching the dough by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
    *   **Even Thickness**: Rolling the dough out to an even thickness throughout is important for consistent cooking and to avoid parts burning while others remain uncooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Hand-stretching often results in uneven thickness, with gossamer-thin areas that burn quickly and thicker areas that remain white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Tool**: If a rolling pin is unavailable, a wine bottle works well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Technique**: Roll and turn the dough, similar to rolling pastry, to prevent sticking and ensure even stretching in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Shape**: Aim for an oblong or rectangular shape, as it is easier to maneuver into and under the broiler in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **Final Thickness**: Roll the dough until it's slightly thicker than the desired final thinness, as it will stretch a bit more during transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Oiling the Dough

After rolling, coat the dough with a very thin film of olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Work quickly to prevent the dough from warming up too much, as cold, stiff dough is easier to drape onto the oven grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## Draping the Dough onto the Oven Grate

The most challenging part of this method is draping the dough onto the hot oven grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

*   **Oil Side Down**: Ensure the oiled side of the dough faces down onto the grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This is important for easy release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Evenness**: The goal is to have every inch of the dough as equally distanced as possible from the broiler above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. If large areas of dough hang too far down around the edges, gently pick them up and stretch them to hang over the nearest grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Remember the grates are hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

This method allows for immediate baking of another pizza after the first, as the grates do not require a long recharge time like a pizza stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

## Why Bake Directly on the Grates?

Baking directly on the hot oven grates, rather than a baking sheet or cooling rack, is essential for this method's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>:

*   **Direct Grilling**: It's akin to grilling pizza on a charcoal grill, providing radiant heat from above and below, plus conductive heat from the hot grate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.
*   **Faster Cooking & Less Moisture Loss**: This combination of heat sources cooks the pizza quicker and results in less moisture loss before the crust browns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.
*   **Intense Top Heat**: Unlike outdoor grilling, this method allows for intense heat from above, achieving excellent browning on the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
*   **Avoids "Cracker" Crust**: Baking on a baking sheet results in a much slower cook time (e.g., eight minutes for initial browning) and a dry, hard, cracker-like crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. A cooling rack is better than a baking sheet, but still results in a slower cook and a more cracker-like crust compared to direct grate cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

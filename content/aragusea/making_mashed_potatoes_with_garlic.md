Mashed potatoes are a classic accompaniment to roast chicken, peas, and gravy, forming "one of the great meals of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This recipe focuses on creating flavorful mashed potatoes with the addition of garlic.

## Ingredients and Preparation
When preparing mashed potatoes, start with about a pound of red potatoes and one large russet potato <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

### Potato Selection and Cutting
*   **Red Potatoes**: Keep the skins on red potatoes as they "taste good and look pretty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Cut them into smaller pieces to ensure quicker boiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Russet Potatoes**: Peel russet potatoes because their skins become "gross in mashed potatoes" and have "the texture of wet construction paper" when boiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. While russet skins are great when [[boiling_and_roasting_potatoes | baked or roasted]], they are not suitable for boiled mash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Cut russet potatoes into slightly larger pieces than the red potatoes because they cook quicker, aiming for both types to finish cooking at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This combination of potatoes offers a desirable "texture and flavor combination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

### Boiling the Potatoes
Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil with the prepared potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The potatoes are done when "you can really easily push a fork through them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Once cooked, drain them using a colander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

### Infusing with Garlic
While the water for the potatoes heats, peel and chop a significant amount of garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Garlic is considered the best flavoring for mashed potatoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

In the same pot used for boiling potatoes, melt some butter and fry the chopped garlic until it just begins to turn golden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Then, add about half a cup of milk and allow it to heat up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Return the drained potatoes to the pot, cover them, and remove from the heat temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

### Enriching with Chicken Fat
One distinctive addition to the mashed potatoes is rendered chicken fat, derived from the pan drippings of a roasted chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This fat can replace some of the butter normally used, contributing "amazing" flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Despite the addition of chicken fat, extra butter is still added to the potatoes, then covered to allow the butter to melt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This leverages the benefits of [[cooking_potatoes_in_chicken_fat | cooking potatoes in chicken fat]].

### Mashing and Seasoning
Generously grind pepper into the potatoes, followed by a large pinch of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Mash the potatoes, starting with an "unconservative" amount of milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. If the texture is too stiff, more milk can be added at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Mashers are not efficient for mixing, so once mashed, switch to a rubber spatula to ensure all ingredients are evenly integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

Finally, cover the mashed potatoes and keep them on a warm setting until ready to serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. The resulting "sticky mash literally brings the whole dish together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

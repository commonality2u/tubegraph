[[what_is_malt | Malt]] is a versatile ingredient found in numerous beverages and baked goods, prized for its unique flavor, color, and enzymatic properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Simply put, [[what_is_malt | malt]] is any cereal grain that has been allowed to germinate or sprout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This process involves soaking dried, viable grain in water, tricking the seeds into thinking they've been exposed to spring rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Diastatic vs. Non-Diastatic Malt

The primary distinction in [[types_of_malt_and_their_uses | types of malt]] lies in their enzymatic power, specifically their diastatic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Diastatic power refers to the ability of the [[what_is_malt | malt]] to convert starch into sugar, primarily due to the presence of [[enzymes_and_malting_process | amylase enzymes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Diastatic Malt
Base malts are dried slowly or at lower temperatures to preserve their [[enzymes_and_malting_process | enzymes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. High temperatures (above 149°F/65°C) will denature or "cook" these [[enzymes_and_malting_process | enzymes]], rendering them incapable of converting starches into sugars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Diastatic malts are essential for processes requiring starch conversion, such as brewing and some baking applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Non-Diastatic Malt
Non-diastatic malts, including malt syrup and many roasted malts, have been subjected to high heat during their production, which deactivates their [[enzymes_and_malting_process | enzymes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. These malts are used primarily for their flavor and color contributions rather than their enzymatic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Malt in Beverages

### Beer and Whiskey Production
[[what_is_malt | Malt]] is a fundamental ingredient in beer and whiskey production. Brewers and distillers crush diastatic or base [[what_is_malt | malt]] with other grains and soak them in water to create a "mash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The [[enzymes_and_malting_process | amylase enzymes]] in the [[what_is_malt | malt]] break down the starches into fermentable sugars, forming a sweet liquid called "wort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Yeast then consumes these sugars, producing alcohol and carbon dioxide through the [[process_of_yeast_fermentation_in_bread_making | process of yeast fermentation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

While wheat can be malted, barley is the most popular grain for making [[what_is_malt | malt]] in brewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This is because barley contains significantly less gluten than wheat, allowing the wort to drain cleanly from the grain mash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Corn, if used, also requires the addition of barley [[what_is_malt | malt]] for enzymatic conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Barley is also easy to grow and has a mild taste, unlike rye, which has a strong flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

Different roast levels of [[what_is_malt | malt]] contribute distinct flavors to beer. Lighter roasted malts can taste like a milkshake, while darker roasted malts resemble cocoa powder or coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### Scotch Whisky and Peat
For some Scotch whisky, the [[what_is_malt | malt]] is dried over peat smoke, imparting a distinctive smoky flavor to the final spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This process directly influences the flavor profile, with some distilleries famously using heavily smoked [[what_is_malt | malt]] and others avoiding it entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This is an example of how [[aging_spirits_in_barrels_and_flavor_development | flavor development]] happens.

### Malt Syrup
Instead of fermenting the wort, it can be boiled down into a non-diastatic [[types_of_malt_and_their_uses | malt syrup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This syrup adds its particular malty flavor and color to baked goods like New York-style bagels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Malted Milk
Malted milk powder is a shelf-stable mix combining [[what_is_malt | malt]] powder with milk powder and wheat flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Originally developed as an easily digestible drink for babies and sick people, it became popular as a preserved energy drink for outdoor enthusiasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Due to its delicious malty flavors, it found widespread use in milkshakes, often with chocolate added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Malted milk balls, like Whoppers, are made by baking malted milk into a biscuit and coating it in chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

## Malt in Baked Goods

### Enhancing Yeast Fermentation
In baking, [[enzymes_and_malting_process | amylase enzymes]] from [[what_is_malt | malt]] are crucial for providing food for yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Yeast cannot ferment complex starches, only simple sugars (one or two glucose units long) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The [[enzymes_and_malting_process | amylase]] breaks down the starches in the grains into these smaller sugars, which the yeast then consumes to produce carbon dioxide, causing bread dough to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Many bread and all-purpose flours in commercial stores already have [[what_is_malt | malt]] flour or [[enzymes_and_malting_process | enzymes]] added for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Advanced bakers may add their own [[enzymes_and_malting_process | enzymes]] to control rise and effects in bread doughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Flavor, Color, and Texture
Non-diastatic [[types_of_malt_and_their_uses | malt]] powder, which is roasted or otherwise deactivated [[what_is_malt | malt]] ground into flour, is used for its flavor and color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. It contains maltose, which has different chemical properties from sucrose and contributes to a deep brown crust in bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. The [[use_of_melted_butter_and_sugar_in_baking | role of ingredients like evaporated milk and salt in texture and flavor]] in bread making, alongside [[baking_techniques_and_their_effects_on_bread_characteristics | baking techniques and their effects on bread characteristics]], contributes to the final product.

### Occupational Hazards for Bakers
Chronic exposure to [[enzymes_and_malting_process | amylase]] can be an occupational hazard for bakers, potentially causing dermatitis and asthma in some individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

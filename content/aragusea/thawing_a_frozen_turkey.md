Choosing a frozen turkey can be an efficient and economical option for holiday meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Frozen turkeys are often cheaper and offer a wider selection of types and sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A 12-pound turkey is considered an ideal size, capable of feeding many people while cooking relatively quickly and evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Thawing Methods

### Cool Water Submersion (Speed Thawing)
For faster thawing, submerge the frozen turkey in cool water in a sink, ensuring the breast side faces down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Water is more effective at drawing cold out of the meat than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

This method requires significant time and attention:
*   A 12-pound turkey can take six to eight hours to thaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   Allow at least one hour of thawing time for every two pounds of turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   The water must be changed every half hour to keep it moving and prevent it from getting too cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   This process uses a considerable amount of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Refrigerator Thawing
If time allows, thawing the turkey in the refrigerator is a more hands-off approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Plan for one day of thawing for every four or five pounds of turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Post-Thawing
Once thawed in the sink, the turkey can either be moved to the refrigerator for a day or two, or roasted immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It's recommended to open the turkey directly in the roasting tray to collect all the juices for gravy and minimize extra cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Remember to remove the giblets and neck from the cavity before cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

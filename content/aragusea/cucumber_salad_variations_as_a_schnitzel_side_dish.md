Cucumber salad is a traditional side dish for schnitzel, often served alongside fries or potato salad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:03">[04:47:03]</a>. It provides a lighter, complementary option to the protein.

## Classic Cucumber Salad

This version of cucumber salad is made with a vinegar and oil dressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:58">[05:30:58]</a>.

### Ingredients
*   **Cucumber**: English cucumbers are recommended due to their dense texture, which works well for thinly sliced salads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. In the U.S., these typically come wrapped in plastic because their skins are unwaxed and good to eat without peeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Any cucumber variety can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Onion**: About half a red onion for one English cucumber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. It's cut down the middle once before thinly slicing to create quarter rounds, a manageable size for a salad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
*   **Dill**: A generous amount of fresh dill is preferred; dried dill can be used in smaller quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   **Dressing**:
    *   Equal quantities of white vinegar and any neutral oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:58">[05:30:58]</a>.
    *   Pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
    *   A pinch of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
    *   A traditional big pinch of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

### Preparation
1.  Slice cucumbers as thinly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
2.  Combine sliced cucumbers and onions in a bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
3.  Add fresh dill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
4.  Whisk together vinegar, neutral oil, pepper, salt, and sugar for the dressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:58">[05:30:58]</a>.
5.  Pour dressing over the vegetables and stir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
6.  For best results, make the salad hours or even a day before serving, allowing it to pickle slightly in the fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
7.  Before serving, stir, taste, and adjust seasonings like vinegar as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

## Creamy Cucumber Salad

A common variation of cucumber salad is the creamy version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

### Preparation
This version uses the exact same base ingredients (cucumber, onion, dill) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>, but replaces the oil and vinegar dressing with a dressing made from vinegar and sour cream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. The sour cream quantity can be eyeballed to achieve desired creaminess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. As with the classic version, it should sit in the fridge for a long time before tasting and adjusting seasonings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

Schnitzel is a very thin cut of meat that has been breaded and fried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The breading process is crucial for achieving the desired texture and flavor.

## General Breading Process

The standard breading process involves three stages: flour, egg, and breadcrumbs. It is recommended to season the meat directly, not the breading, as it allows for better judgment of the salt quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>.

1.  **Season the Meat**: Apply salt lightly directly to the thin meat, rather than trying to judge the amount needed for a pile of flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>. For thin cuts like schnitzel, the seasoning on the meat cannot be distinguished from seasoning on the breading after cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. A conservative approach to salting is advised, as more salt can always be added at the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:41">[09:17:41]</a>.
2.  **Flour**: Dust the meat in plain flour, ensuring the application is as light and thin as possible. Knock off any excess flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.
3.  **Egg Wash**: Use one beaten egg, smoothed with a fork, as an egg wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. Dip the floured meat into the egg, again ensuring any excess is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:26">[01:29:26]</a>.
4.  **Breadcrumbs**: Finally, coat the meat in breadcrumbs. The key is to avoid pressing the meat into the breadcrumbs; instead, apply them lightly, letting only what naturally sticks adhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Breadcrumb Types and Preparation

Different types of breadcrumbs can be used, each affecting the final texture of the schnitzel:

*   **Traditional Breadcrumbs**: These are typically made from stale bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. However, modern bread often contains dough conditioners that delay staling, making it difficult to achieve the necessary dry, fine crumbs at home using a food processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>.
*   **Store-Bought Fine Breadcrumbs**: These are readily available and are very fine and bone dry, suitable for schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Panko Breadcrumbs**: While not traditional for schnitzel, Japanese panko breadcrumbs are notably crispier than other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:44">[02:07:44]</a>.
    *   **Modification for Schnitzel**: Panko crumbs are typically too large and jagged for a delicate dish like schnitzel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:04">[02:14:04]</a>. They can be ground down in a food processor to a finer consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:04">[02:18:04]</a>.
    *   **Crispiness**: Blitzed (finely ground) panko offers a foolproof method for achieving a consistently crispy crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

## Breading for Different Meats

The breading process remains consistent regardless of the meat used for schnitzel. The video demonstrates this with [[preparing_different_types_of_schnitzel_veal_chicken_and_pork | veal]], [[preparing_different_types_of_schnitzel_veal_chicken_and_pork | pork]], and [[preparing_different_types_of_schnitzel_veal_chicken_and_pork | chicken]]:

*   **Veal (Wienerschnitzel)**: The iconic dish of Vienna, specifically made with veal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **Pork (Schweinen Schnitzel)**: Made by butterflying and pounding pork loin chops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:12">[06:57:12]</a>.
*   **Chicken**: Typically made by halving and pounding large chicken breasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:20">[08:22:20]</a>. Chicken tends to shred and break apart more easily when pounded, requiring care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.

## Flavor Variations in Breading

A simple way to enhance the flavor of the breading, particularly for [[preparing_different_types_of_schnitzel_veal_chicken_and_pork | chicken schnitzel]], is to add a spoonful of mustard to the egg wash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. While not traditional, it adds a tasty kick, though it may contribute to uneven coloring on the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

## Advanced Techniques (for reference)

Some "schnitzel masters" employ aggressive pan-shaking during frying to partially separate the breading from the meat, causing it to fry into a phyllo-like shell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This is an advanced technique not typically achievable by non-experts.

[[History and production of palm oil | Palm oil]] is the most consumed plant oil globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It is widely used in processed foods, soaps, cosmetics, and biofuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Saturated Fat Content
[[History and production of palm oil | Palm oil]], derived from the fruit of the [[History and production of palm oil | oil palm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, is characterized by its high saturated fat content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

*   **Palm Oil (from fruit)**: Approximately 50% saturated fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This makes it semi-solid at room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **[[History and production of palm oil | Palm kernel oil]] (from seed)**: Even more saturated, around 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Due to their high saturation, these fats behave more like animal fats, which are generally very saturated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This property also contributes to their stability, making them less prone to oxidation and rancidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This natural saturation means [[History and production of palm oil | palm oil]] does not require industrial processing like hydrogenation to become more viscous and shelf-stable, unlike other unsaturated oils like cottonseed oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Replacement for Trans Fats
The significant increase in [[History and production of palm oil | palm oil]] usage is partly due to the push to eliminate trans fats from processed foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Trans fats, which resulted from partially hydrogenating unsaturated oils, are considered by medical science to be the "worst kind of fat" to consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Products like Crisco, which previously contained trans fats, now use [[History and production of palm oil | palm oil]] as an ingredient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Public Perception
In some regions, such as India, there is a stigma associated with [[History and production of palm oil | palm oil]] usage, as consumers are aware that it is "not healthy" and it is not grown domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Despite this perception, it remains widely used, especially by street vendors, due to its affordability compared to other oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

For a white pizza that offers a flavorful experience distinct from traditional tomato-based pies, specific cheese choices are crucial for both the sauce and the topping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Cheese for the White Pizza Sauce

Unlike many white pizza sauces that are often based on ricotta cheese and can lack flavor, this recipe utilizes a garlicky cream sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Hard Cheese Selection
Hard cheese is incorporated into the cream sauce to provide a savory depth and crucial acidity:
*   **Pecorino Romano** is the preferred choice due to its acidity, which helps to replace the acidity typically found in tomato sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Parmesan** can be used as an alternative if Pecorino Romano is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Approximately 20 grams of grated hard cheese is used for one 12 or 13-inch pizza, matching the quantity of chopped garlic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The hard cheese also provides sufficient salt, eliminating the need for additional seasoning in the sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Incorporating Hard Cheese into the Sauce
To prevent a grainy texture, it's important to add the hard cheese to the sauce after it has cooled down and the bubbling has stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Adding it while the sauce is boiling will cause the cheese proteins to over-coagulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Cheese for the Pizza Topping

For achieving the traditional [[new_york_style_pizza_cheese_preferences | New York style]] flavor and texture on a white pizza, the specific type of mozzarella is key:
*   **Whole milk low-moisture mozzarella** is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   This type of mozzarella may be available as string cheese in some regions, which can be sliced into rounds for the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Avoiding Overcooking
When baking the pizza, particular care should be taken to avoid overcooking. If the sauce gets too hot, the fat will separate from the cheese and create an undesirable yellow grease layer on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

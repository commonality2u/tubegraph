A frittata is described as the "perfect egg dish" due to its versatility, quick preparation, affordability, and minimal skill requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Equipment

*   10-inch nonstick skillet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   Whisk or fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   Silicone spatula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>

## [[frittata_ingredients_and_variations | Frittata Ingredients and Variations]]

Almost anything can be incorporated into a frittata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

The basic formula includes:
*   Some kind of onion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Some kind of cured pork product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
*   Some kind of green vegetable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Some kind of fresh herb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>

### Suggested Ingredients
*   **Fats**: Olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Aromatics**: 1-2 shallots, thinly sliced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   **Meats**: Prosciutto (3 slices), or any thin meat like bacon, pancetta, or salami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   **Vegetables**: Leftover steamed broccoli, chopped into small bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>
*   **Herbs**: Dill, or any fresh herb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
*   **Eggs**: 2-3 eggs per person; 6 total eggs suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Using eggs with golden yellow yolks from a natural forage diet is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Dairy**: A "glug" of milk or cream for a softer texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Seasoning**: Pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Salt may not be needed if using salty ingredients like prosciutto and cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Cheese**: Smoked gouda or any cheese, grated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Barry College dairy's creamy Jersey cow cheese is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Saut√©ing Ingredients
1.  Heat a 10-inch nonstick skillet with a little olive oil on medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
2.  Add thinly sliced shallots first to allow them to caramelize and become sweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This gives a flavor reminiscent of a Spanish omelet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
3.  Add thin meat slices, such as prosciutto (rolled up for easier cutting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Cook until crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
    *   **Note**: All solid ingredients should be mostly cooked by the time eggs are poured in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Incorporating Pre-cooked Ingredients
*   **Leftovers**: Frittatas are great for absorbing leftovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. If using pre-cooked items like steamed broccoli, add them right before the eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Fresh Herbs**: Add fresh herbs like dill right before the eggs to prevent overcooking and browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Egg Mixture Preparation

1.  Lightly beat eggs with a whisk or fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   **Tip**: A completely homogenous texture is not desired; streaks of yolk and white are preferred in the finished frittata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
2.  Add a "glug" of milk or cream for a softer texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   **Note**: Some believe milk/cream makes eggs slimy or causes water separation, but this usually only happens if eggs are overcooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Grind in pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
4.  Grate 1-2 ounces of cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Incorporate about half of the grated cheese into the egg mixture and reserve the rest for sprinkling on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
    *   **Note**: Do not measure ingredients precisely; aim for roughly equal volumes of egg mixture and solid ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## [[cooking_techniques_for_frittata | Cooking Techniques for Frittata]]

1.  Before pouring in the eggs, ensure prosciutto is crispy and shallots are caramelized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Add broccoli and dill, mixing everything up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
2.  Pour the egg mixture into the skillet with the prepared ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
3.  Stir the mixture with a silicone spatula to ensure even distribution of ingredients and faster, more even cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Scrape down the sides of the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
4.  Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
5.  Turn on the oven's broiler (Brits call it a grill) to a low setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Being conservative with broiler settings is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
6.  Place the skillet under the broiler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Cook the frittata entirely under the broiler for a nice brown top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   **Note**: Some people bake their frittata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
7.  Adjust broiler setting from low to high as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Doneness and Serving

*   **Doneness**: The frittata is done when the eggs look solid and don't slosh around when the pan is shaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The top will visibly puff up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. If uncertain, touch it; it should be soft but bouncy. If it feels squishy like a water balloon, it's still liquid inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   Example: A frittata looking almost done after two minutes may need the broiler turned to high for another minute for desired browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Cooling**: Let the frittata cool down and solidify for a few minutes before removing it from the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Release from Pan**:
    *   To check if it's stuck or to release it, shake the pan back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   With a nonstick pan, it can often be "shimmy-shaked" out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, place a plate over the pan, turn it out onto the plate, then place another board or plate on top and flip it again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Presentation**: It often looks like a pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Serving**: It's best thoroughly rested and lukewarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Cut into wedges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   A side salad can provide good flavor and texture contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   A frittata is often considered a perfect all-in-one meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, making it an ideal weeknight home-cooked meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
    *   It's noted as being as good as a French-style omelet but requiring "basically no technique" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

> [!INFO] Spanish Omelette vs. Frittata
> While a frittata can be reminiscent of a Spanish omelet in flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, a Spanish omelet is considerably harder to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Cast iron pans are known for their durability and cooking properties, but they require specific care and maintenance, particularly ongoing seasoning, to perform optimally and prevent issues like rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While some find cast iron maintenance burdensome, its ability to become non-stick through seasoning is a primary virtue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Drawbacks and Challenges of Cast Iron Maintenance
Compared to modern materials like stainless steel, [[drawbacks_of_cast_iron_pans | cast iron has several maintenance challenges]]:
*   Cannot be put in the dishwasher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
*   Should not be used with hard, sharp tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   Requires constant seasoning through a process that can be messy and smelly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Will rust without regular maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   May require restoration with methods like electrolysis if rust or seasoning damage is severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Seasoning: The Non-Stick Secret
The second great virtue of cast iron cookware is its ability to become non-stick through seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### What is Seasoning?
Seasoning involves rubbing a little oil on the pan and then burning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This process causes the oil to break down and polymerize, creating a glassy surface called a patina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This patina can be almost as nonstick as Teflon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Cast iron's rough surface, which comes from the sand in its mold, allows for better mechanical adherence of the seasoning compared to a shiny surface like stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### Factory vs. Home Seasoning
Most modern cast iron manufacturers pre-season their pans at the factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. However, even factory seasoning is often not enough; users at home need to build up many thin layers of seasoning for a truly non-stick surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Applying a super thick layer of oil at once will not create a good seasoning; it will result in a burnt oil crust that chips off, or a gunky, sticky surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Best Oils for Seasoning
While scholarly research on the best oils and procedures for seasoning cast iron is lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, manufacturers have conducted proprietary research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Victoria cookware uses flaxseed oil for factory seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Flaxseed oil is favored because it has strong polymer properties, particularly its high alpha linoleic acid content, which aids polymerization and creates a harder patina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

Any edible oil can be used successfully for seasoning cast iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, though saturated fats don't work as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Some prefer blended oils like Buzzy Wax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, or spray-on oils for an even coat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### The Seasoning Process
A common procedure for seasoning a cast iron pan involves:
1.  **Pre-heating:** Heat the pan on medium-low for about 10 minutes to evaporate any residual water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
2.  **Applying Oil:** Put a tiny bit of oil on the pan and rub it everywhere with a paper towel, aiming for the thinnest possible layer until the oil seems to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
3.  **Baking:** Place the pan upside down in the oven to allow excess oil to drip off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
4.  **Oven Temperature:** Heat the oven to its highest temperature, such as 500 degrees Fahrenheit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Some suggest heating to the smoke point of the oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
5.  **Baking Time:** Let the pan cook in the hot oven for an hour, which might produce a smell from the burning oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
6.  **Cooling:** Turn off the oven and let the pan gradually cool down inside for a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

For a stronger patina, this process can be repeated five or six more times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Alternatively, consistent cooking with the pan will also build seasoning over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. If cracks or uneven spots appear in an old patina, a proper round of oven seasoning can be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

## Daily Maintenance and Care

### Cleaning Your Pan
After cooking, clean the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Sharp or abrasive things can chip seasoning, but gentle scrubbies and warm water are fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

There is debate about using soap on cast iron pans. In the past, lye-based soaps would strip seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. However, contemporary soaps like Dawn do not have lye as a basis and generally work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### Drying and Re-oiling
After washing, it's best to dry the pan by putting it back on the heat to evaporate any water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Then, rub on a thin coat of oil before putting the pan away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This oil layer forms a water-safe barrier against humidity, preventing corrosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. When the pan is next heated for cooking, this oil layer will polymerize further, contributing to the seasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

### Dealing with Rust and Damage
If a cast iron pan rusts or its seasoning is badly messed up, it might need to be restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Methods for restoration include the "Easy Off" method, lye baths, and electrolysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. These methods are typically used by professionals who restore antique cast iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Important Considerations

### Acidic Foods
Cooking very acidic foods in cast iron pans is generally not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Acidic ingredients can cause iron to leach from the pan, which can result in a gross taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### Infrequent Use
If a cast iron pan is stored for months without use, bad things can happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The oil applied for protection can go rancid, and the pan might rust to the point of needing professional restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Therefore, cast iron is best suited for those who will use it regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

### Enameled Cast Iron
For those seeking the benefits of cast iron's thermal mass and shaping possibilities without the strict seasoning and rust prevention, enameled or glazed cast iron is an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. These pans feature a baked-on layer of glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, preventing rust and allowing dishwasher use and cooking with acidic ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. However, enameled cast iron cannot be seasoned, so it is not non-stick, and it is significantly more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

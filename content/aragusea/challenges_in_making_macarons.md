From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 
The macaron, an old-world pastry, is notoriously fussy to make at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. However, if one liberates themselves from "precious expectations" about how they should look, they can be one of the easiest and cheapest desserts to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Common Macaron Challenges and Simplified Approaches

### Achieving "Perfect" Appearance
The "big challenge" with macarons is typically getting perfectly smooth domes and ruffled edges known as "macaron feet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. However, the author argues that they don't have to look perfect as long as they taste good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Meringue cookies are described as "the most forgiving pastry on earth" if one doesn't get hung up on appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Structural integrity is presented as the only objective standard that truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

Radically altering ingredient proportions can result in different, but still good, outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. For example, using less sugar can result in a chewier, brownie-like consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Egg Preparation
*   **Temperature:** Egg whites are easier to separate and beat better if they are warm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A simple method is to leave them in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Separation:** A risky method involves cracking the shell and passing the yolk between the two halves until the whites ooze out. This method avoids dirtying extra dishes but risks having to start over if the yolk punctures and falls into the whites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Precision:** Because eggs vary in size, a precise recipe requires weighing the whites on a gram scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Equipment and Mixing
*   **Mixer:** A $300 stand mixer is not necessary; a $12 electric hand mixer makes the process easy and offers more control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Beating Egg Whites:** Beat whites until they are just fluffy and foamy, without risking over-beating them at this initial stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Adding Sugar:** While some recipes suggest gradually sprinkling in sugar, simply dumping it in makes no difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. A double boiler is not required; sugar can be beaten directly into the eggs in the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Macaronage (Mixing Dry Ingredients):** The French term for this mixing phase is "macaronage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The mixture should initially feel too dry but will eventually come together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Stop mixing when it looks like a mousse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Over-mixing past this point will loosen the mixture, resulting in a flatter, smoother macaron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Different mixing consistencies yield different results, with a thicker batter producing craggy tops that some may prefer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Ingredient Preparation
*   **[[Almond Flour and Meringue Ingredients|Almond Flour]]:** Making your own [[Almond Flour and Meringue Ingredients|almond flour]] from blanched almonds in a food processor can be challenging to get a fine enough consistency, which can lead to a gritty cookie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. It is recommended to buy pre-made [[Almond Flour and Meringue Ingredients|almond flour]], choosing packages with a visual window to assess fineness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Sifting:** Sifting dry ingredients together can dirty additional dishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Sifting sugar or [[Almond Flour and Meringue Ingredients|almond flour]] has little noticeable effect, though it can break up cocoa powder chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Salt:** Only a few grains of salt are needed for seasoning, as macarons are mostly air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Piping and Shaping
Piping bags are useful for making large quantities or achieving perfectly sized and shaped macarons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. For smaller batches, a spoon can be used to dollop the batter onto parchment paper, creating less perfectly shaped but still delicious cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Using a piping bag can also be wasteful, as batter gets stuck inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Baking Process
*   **Drying Time:** Traditionally, macarons are left to sit and dry out for about half an hour before baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This step can result in a smoother surface and forces the macaron to expand upward instead of outward in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Oven Temperature:** While some suggest complex oven preheating and temperature lowering, a consistent 350°F (180°C) is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Cracking:** To prevent cracking, some recipes recommend emulating a steam injection oven by pouring boiling water into a pan inside the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. However, letting them crack can be beneficial, as cracking can indicate when they are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Cracked or irregular edges can become crispier and more caramelized, potentially enhancing the taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Cooling:** Macarons need to cool and solidify for a long time before filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Filling and Storage
*   **Ganache:** A simple ganache can be made with equal parts cream and chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. If the meringues are very sweet, a bitter chocolate can balance the flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** The ganache will be too loose immediately after melting and needs to cool to a thicker consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This can be done by waiting at room temperature or quickly in the fridge, stirring frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Filling Quantity:** Since meringue is insubstantial, it's important to be careful not to overfill the macarons, as too much ganache can overwhelm the meringues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Post-Baking Texture:** While macarons can be eaten immediately, they are often better the next day as the meringues absorb moisture from the filling and air, resulting in a chewier, marshmallow-like consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Large air pockets inside are desirable for texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

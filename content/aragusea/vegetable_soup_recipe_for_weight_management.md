## Ingredients and Preparation
The soup preparation starts with basic steps for [[Vegetable preparation for soup | vegetable preparation]] and cooking:

*   **Onion**: Begin with some kind of onion, such as green Vidalia onions, which are readily available to the author due to living near the Vidalia region of Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Chop the onions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Carrot**: Add a large carrot, chopped, to the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Boiling Liquid**: Boil the onions and carrots in water, not stock, as this is said to make the most delicious vegetable soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Tomato**: Once the harder vegetables are cooking, chop one or two tomatoes, including the skins, for their nutritional value and pectin content, which helps thicken the broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Wine**: A small amount of white wine can be added for flavor, even if not strictly part of a diet plan, as its proportion is small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This is part of the [[Using wine or vinegar in vegetable soup | broader discussion on using wine or vinegar]].
*   **Cruciferous Vegetables**: When the initial vegetables are at least half cooked, add a type of cabbage or kale, ideally a crinkly variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The [[Benefits of using kale or cabbage in soup | benefits of kale or cabbage]] are highlighted for their nutritional value.
*   **Garlic**: Once the cabbage/kale is tender, add fresh chopped garlic right at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Seasoning**: Season with plenty of salt, a little pepper, and a dash of vinegar for acidity, if preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Frozen Peas**: Add frozen peas, which will thaw in the residual heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Finishing Touches**: Serve with raw olive oil in the bowl to aid in the digestion of fat-soluble vitamins and for flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. A little fresh herb can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

The author notes that this soup tastes so good it doesn't feel like a chore to eat, even daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Dietary Considerations and Tips
*   **Digestibility**: When introducing many cruciferous vegetables (like cabbage and cauliflower) at once, consider taking a supplement containing the enzyme alpha-galactosidase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This enzyme helps break down large sugars found in these vegetables and beans, preventing them from being metabolized by gut microorganisms, which can lead to gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Oral Hygiene**: The author suggests brushing and flossing frequently to reduce cravings for sweets, believing that bad tastes in the mouth often trigger these cravings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Supplements**: A multivitamin and fish oil supplement are also part of the author's routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

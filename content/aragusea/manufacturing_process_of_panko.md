Panko is a type of breadcrumb that originated in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While individual crumbs often appear long and pointy, they can also be ground into tiny bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Even when powdered, panko fries up significantly crispier than other breadcrumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This unique crispiness stems from a distinct manufacturing process, particularly how the bread for panko is baked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Unique Baking Process

The bread used for panko is baked using electrical current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This method is used by manufacturers like Upper Crust Enterprises in Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Electrical Current Baking

The process involves placing dough buckets between metal plates that conduct electricity through the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The dough's resistance to this current generates heat, causing the bread to steam cook from the inside out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The electric flow stops once enough water evaporates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Effects on the Bread

This internal cooking method has several notable effects on the resulting bread, leading to the [[difference_between_panko_and_traditional_breadcrumbs | differences between panko and traditional breadcrumbs]]:
*   **No Crust** The most obvious effect is the complete absence of a crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Unlike conventional bread baked with external heat, which dries out, heats up, and caramelizes the outer surface to form a crust, panko bread has no such outer structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Delicate Structure** Without a crust, the bread lacks external structure, making it very delicate and requiring careful handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Uniformity and Neutral Flavor** Because there's no crust, panko bread has a totally uniform color and a more neutral flavor, acting as a "blank canvas" for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Airy Interior** The baking with current also affects the interior structure of the loaf, creating an extremely light, airy crumb that is super crispy when dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This "airy" quality means it's both brittle and light, consisting of thin sheets of brittle material interspersed with voids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This microstructure makes panko more absorbent than western-style breadcrumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Crumbing and Microstructure

After baking, the bread is processed into crumbs. The traditional panko shape consists of long, jagged shards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Achieving this "sliver shape" is not primarily due to the grinder, but rather to the quality of the baking and fermentation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Proper fermentation allows the proteins to connect, resulting in a natural lengthening of the gluten fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. When ground, this elongated gluten naturally flakes into slivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

This airy microstructure is key to panko's unique performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>:
*   **Crispiness** The airiness is a significant reason why panko is much crispier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Absorbency and Oil Drainage** While panko absorbs a lot of oil during frying, its open hollows allow the oil to drain out when removed from the fryer, making it less greasy, less heavy, and enabling it to stay crispier for longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The dryness of the crumbs may also play a role, as a vacuum created by cooling water vapor in the crust typically sucks in oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This airiness allows panko to be both absorbent and crispy simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Retaining Properties when Ground** Panko's airy structure also means it retains its properties even when ground into a powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## [[origin_story_and_invention_of_panko | Origin Story and Development]]

The [[origin_story_and_invention_of_panko | origin story]] of panko, as related by Gary Kawaguchi of Upper Crust Enterprises, traces back to the Sino-Japanese War, which became part of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Japanese soldiers in China, lacking food, mixed flour and connected it to a tank battery to bake bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This "necessity is the mother of invention" moment explains the unique electrical baking method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

After World War II, the new panko industry benefited from the U.S. supplying Japan with wheat through food aid and trade deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Despite the availability of normal ovens, panko manufacturers continued to use electrical current for baking because it yielded the extremely light, airy crumb with superior crispiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## [[panko_as_a_commercial_product_and_its_market | Commercial Production and Characteristics]]

Companies like Upper Crust Enterprises specialize in producing panko using these traditional methods. They sell their product exclusively to restaurants and other commercial food businesses, not directly to consumers in stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

The long sliver shape of panko is crucial for applications like Japanese-style breaded shrimp or [[breading_techniques_and_variations_for_schnitzel | chicken katsu]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This shape is more expensive to produce due to the need for delicate machining and packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Even "cheap" panko is generally more expensive than other breadcrumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Attempting Homemade Panko

Some people try to make panko at home by cutting crusts off white sandwich loaves, then shredding and drying the bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. There are also claims that some panko producers use microwaves instead of shocking their loaves, which theoretically would also cook the bread from the inside out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. However, it is likely very difficult to produce professional-quality panko at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

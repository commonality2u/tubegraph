Historically, [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | salted butter]] was vastly different from what is commonly found today, primarily due to its original purpose as a preservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Preservation Through Salt
The addition of salt to butter was initially not for flavor, but as an [[preservation_and_fermentation_of_butter | ancient preservative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Elaine Custerova, author of "Butter: A Rich History," explains that salt was used with various foods like fish and meat to extend their shelf life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Butter was a natural candidate for salting if it needed to be kept for any length of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Exceptions to Salting
An exception to salting for preservation was in India, where butter was preserved by boiling it down to evaporate the liquid, creating ghee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Removing water prevents bacterial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This method was a practical necessity in the hot Indian subcontinent, as solid butter cannot exist in ambient temperatures above 90°F (32°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Salt Levels Through History
The Western tradition of solid butter making likely originated in Northern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The Vikings, considered early European butter makers, produced salted butter that was significantly saltier than the seas they sailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

*   **Viking Butter**: Viking butter contained about *ten times* the amount of salt as modern salted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This level of salt made it inedible until it was soaked in cold water to leach out some of the salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   Modern Land O'Lakes salted butter contains approximately 1.64% salt by weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Therefore, Viking butter would have been around 16.4% salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, equating to about 2.3 grams (half a teaspoon) of [[usage_of_kosher_salt_in_culinary_practices | Morton kosher salt]] per tablespoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Such high salt content was necessary for long-term preservation, especially for winter supplies or lengthy voyages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Pickled Butter**: A 19th-century White House cookbook included a recipe for "pickled butter," where fresh butter was wrapped in muslin and stored in a brine of salt and sugar for preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Medieval and Recent Times**: Even into medieval times, table butter was likely three times as salty as modern salted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, equating to about 4.9% salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Dairy industry publications from about a century ago describe butter with three or four percent salt, which is two to three times saltier than current butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This was considered the minimum salt needed to keep butter fresh for more than a few days without refrigeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Evolution of Butter Saltiness
The significant reduction in butter's salt content is primarily due to:
*   **Refrigeration**: The advent of refrigeration eliminated the need for high salt levels as a primary preservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Industrialization**: The growth of large-scale, temperature-controlled logistical networks allowed for the delivery of fresh butter to a wider population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: As butter production moved to creameries and factories, a selling point became "less salt" to signify freshness and mask any "off flavors" like rancidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## [[cultural_perceptions_of_butter_types | Cultural Perceptions of Butter Types]]
A long-standing cultural notion is that [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | unsalted butter]] is "fancier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

*   **French Influence**: The French, particularly dairymaids outside Paris, produced a beautiful [[preservation_and_fermentation_of_butter | cultured (fermented)]] unsalted butter that could be sold at a much higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This butter was tangy like yogurt and offered an alternative means of [[preservation_and_fermentation_of_butter | food preservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The perception of French culinary practices as high-class contributed to the appeal of unsalted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Luxury Item**: Before refrigeration, unsalted butter that hadn't gone bad was a luxury item, as it was scarce and thus expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Modern Culinary Influence**: In the 1960s and 70s, chefs like Julia Child and Jacques Pepin, and later Alton Brown, introduced unsalted butter into American home kitchens, emphasizing its use for precision in [[cooking_with_different_types_of_butter | cooking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Alton Brown specifically taught home cooks to measure by weight and use unsalted butter for standardization, allowing for better control over the amount of salt in food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Modern Usage and Personal Preference
While professional kitchens often prioritize standardization and precision with unsalted butter, for the home cook, the choice between [[salted_vs_unsalted_butter | salted and unsalted butter]] can be a matter of personal preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Salt perception and preference vary widely from person to person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Most recipes can be adapted to either type of butter by tasting and adjusting salt levels accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Julia Child herself stated in "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" that American salted and French butter are largely interchangeable in cooking, except for certain desserts and cake frostings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Many modern recipes assume the use of salted butter, especially in regions like North America and the UK where it is more popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

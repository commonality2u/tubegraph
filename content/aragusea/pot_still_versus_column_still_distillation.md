Liquor is broadly defined as any alcoholic beverage, typically containing at least one or two percent ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Ethanol is the specific type of alcohol consumed for enjoyment, characterized by two carbon atoms attached to hydrogen atoms and a hydroxyl group (an oxygen atom stuck to a hydrogen atom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. Drinks with less than one percent ethanol are virtually impossible to get intoxicated by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.

## The Biological Ceiling of Fermentation
Traditional alcoholic beverages like beer and wine are made by introducing yeast to a sweet, nutrient-rich liquid, which the yeast metabolize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:08">[01:26:08]</a>. The byproducts of this process include ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:94">[01:31:94]</a>. However, ethanol is a poison, and yeast can only raise its concentration so high before it becomes toxic to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a>. High concentrations of ethanol disrupt proteins and cell membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:95">[01:57:95]</a>. This biological ceiling means that traditional beer and wine generally max out at an alcohol content somewhere in the teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:96">[02:08:96]</a>. To achieve a higher alcohol beverage, the ethanol must be extracted and refined from the fermented liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>, a process known as [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distillation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:75">[02:46:75]</a>.

## Pot Still Distillation
The pot still is the original form of still, known for its simplicity and ease of cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:51">[03:57:51]</a>.

### Historical Background
[[distillation_and_its_historical_background | Distillation]] dates back to the ancient world, with illustrations of pot stills used by a Greek alchemist in 3rd century CE Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:47">[04:04:47]</a>. Evidence of basic [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distillation]] exists even earlier in Mesopotamia and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:14">[04:14:14]</a>. Ancient peoples likely discovered the process by observing that boiling a liquid turns it into steam, which then condenses back into a different liquid on nearby surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:83">[04:22:83]</a>. This condensed liquid was noticed to be purer than the original, for instance, clear water from muddy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:11">[04:47:11]</a>. A low-tech method called "rag [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distillation]]" involved holding a fibrous material over boiling water to collect condensed liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:39">[05:03:39]</a>. Retorts, made of clay and later metals, were used across the ancient world: a jug for liquid over fire, opening to a narrow neck where vapors would rise, cool, and drip into a receiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:01">[05:46:01]</a>.

### The Pot Still Process
In a pot still, fermented liquid (like wine or "wash") is heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:15">[07:00:15]</a>. Ethanol boils at a lower temperature (78 degrees Celsius / 173 Fahrenheit) than water (100 degrees Celsius / 212 Fahrenheit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:81">[07:27:81]</a>. As the liquid heats, the ethanol vaporizes first, rising as gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:50">[07:49:50]</a>. This gas then travels up a column and is cooled in a condenser tube (like a serpentine condenser) to convert back into a liquid, which is collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:12">[08:04:12]</a>.

### Congeners and Cuts
The distilled liquid contains not just ethanol but also other volatile compounds called congeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:63">[10:52:63]</a>. These can include non-poisonous elements like tannins and esters, which contribute to flavor, but also toxic substances like fusel alcohols and, most notably, methanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:35">[11:08:35]</a>. Methanol, even in small amounts (10 milliliters), can cause permanent blindness, and 30 milliliters can be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:39">[11:34:39]</a>.

Fortunately, methanol is more volatile than ethanol, meaning it comes off the still at the very beginning of the run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:53">[11:43:53]</a>. Distillers traditionally make "cuts" to separate these components:
*   **Head Cuts / Foreshot**: The first portion of the distillate, which contains most of the methanol and other harsh, undesirable compounds, and is typically discarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:24">[11:51:24]</a>.
*   **Heart Cuts**: The middle portion of the run, which is the purest ethanol and the desired product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:07">[12:31:07]</a>.
*   **Tail Cuts**: The last portion, which again contains more congeners and is often undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:48">[12:40:48]</a>.

Historically, distillers used their noses and tongues to determine these cut points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:58">[12:13:58]</a>.

### Rectification
With a pot still, achieving higher purity or removing more congeners often requires multiple [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distillation]] runs, a process known as rectification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:31">[13:36:31]</a>. By repeatedly distilling and discarding the heads and tails, the spirit can be purified to up to 95% ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:17">[13:40:17]</a>.

*   If almost all congeners are stripped out, the result is vodka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:30">[13:51:30]</a>. Vodka can be made from various fermented bases, including grapes, potatoes, corn, wheat, rye, or oats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:95">[14:07:95]</a>.
*   If some non-poisonous congeners are left in for flavor, the result is a more flavorful spirit like brandy (from grape juice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:88">[14:41:88]</a> or whiskey (from beer/grain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:13">[14:52:13]</a>. Pot stills are used for spirits like rum (from sugar cane/molasses) and grain-based spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:25">[03:22:25]</a>.

## Column Still Distillation
While pot stills are effective and still used, more efficient stills were developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:23">[15:00:23]</a>. The column still is a continuous [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distillation]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:71">[15:25:71]</a>.

Unlike a pot still, a column still does not have a bulbous pot because it continuously pumps the fermented liquid (e.g., wine) into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:03">[15:16:03]</a>. In a column still, water tends to fall, while ethanol vapor rises through multiple columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:80">[15:40:80]</a>. Each column effectively acts as a separate [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distillation]] stage, meaning spirits can be "distilled" multiple times within one continuous run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:97">[16:01:97]</a>. Column stills are highly efficient for stripping out heads and producing pure products continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:36">[16:13:36]</a>.

## Aging and Flavor Development
After [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distillation]], many spirits are placed into wooden barrels for [[aging_spirits_in_barrels_and_flavor_development | aging spirits in barrels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:41">[16:29:41]</a>. Initially, barrels were used for storage, but it was quickly discovered that the liquor's quality improved significantly over time within the wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:38">[16:33:38]</a>.

The process of [[aging_spirits_in_barrels_and_flavor_development | aging spirits in barrels]] involves:
*   **Charring**: Barrels are often charred on the inside (e.g., char-4 for bourbon), which historically may have been for cleaning or sterilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:24">[16:51:24]</a>. However, it imparts smoky tastes, as well as flavors like vanilla or cherry, into the liquor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:51">[17:06:51]</a>.
*   **Expansion and Contraction**: In environments not fully climate-controlled, barrels expand and contract with temperature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:06">[17:13:06]</a>. This action draws the liquor into and out of the wood, infusing it with wood flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:52">[17:21:52]</a>.
*   **Chemical Changes**: Over years or even decades, the alcohol undergoes its own chemical transformations independent of the wood, leading to a smoother spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:34">[17:45:34]</a>.

[[aging_spirits_in_barrels_and_flavor_development | Aging spirits in barrels]] can take many years, which presents a financial challenge for distilleries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:50">[17:51:50]</a>. This is why many newer distilleries focus on unaged spirits like vodkas, gins, or un-aged rums and liqueurs, as they provide immediate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:41">[18:09:41]</a>. Master distillers often blend liquor from different barrels to combine qualities and create a unique product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:33">[18:57:33]</a>.

**Important Legal Note**:
Distilling ethanol without a permit is illegal in the United States, as these laws aim to control the production of drinking alcohol for human consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:03">[06:21:03]</a>. Educational or scientific [[distillation_and_its_historical_background | distillation]] in non-consumption quantities is typically permissible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:48">[06:40:48]</a>. Additionally, using an open flame for distilling highly combustible ethanol is not recommended due to safety risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:92">[07:08:92]</a>.

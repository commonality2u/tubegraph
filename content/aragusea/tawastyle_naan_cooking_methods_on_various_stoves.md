It is possible to prepare restaurant-quality garlic naan at home without a tandoor, using a pan on the stove, and without needing an oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method, often done on a tawa (a flat round griddle pan with no sides), can be replicated using a cast iron skillet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Dough Preparation
Traditional Indian-style breads exhibit diverse leaveners, including curd (yogurt with live active bacterial cultures), dried yeast, and chemical leaveners like baking soda and baking powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:35]</a>. Some traditional recipes call for all three types of leaveners, representing millennia of baking history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:48]</a>.

### No-Yeast Naan Dough
For a naan texture similar to Indian restaurants, a no-yeast dough is often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
Ingredients for four loaves (approximately 250g flour):
*   2 cups all-purpose flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:06]</a>
*   1 teaspoon sugar (enhances browning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:10]</a>
*   ½ teaspoon salt (more can be added as a topping later) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:15]</a>
*   1 teaspoon double-acting baking powder (helps texture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Scant ¼ teaspoon baking soda (to neutralize yogurt acidity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:26]</a>
*   2 tablespoons oil (e.g., olive oil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:29]</a>
*   ¼ cup (60g) yogurt (crucially, containing live active bacterial cultures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Milk or water as needed (start with ½ cup/100ml, add more while kneading) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:40]</a>

Unlike Western dough recipes that start wet, Indian dough recipes often start dry and knead in liquid until the desired texture is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:53]</a>. The ideal texture is soft and barely sticky, drier than pizza dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:02:00]</a>. Gluten development is sufficient when the dough bounces back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:06]</a>.
The dough should be oiled to prevent drying out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:08]</a>. Although it's a quick bread that can be cooked immediately, allowing it to sit for at least 30 minutes under a wet towel, or even several hours, improves bubbling and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:18]</a>. Many no-yeast naan recipes suggest leaving dough for hours in a warm place, relying on bacteria in the curd for leavening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:25]</a>.
Just before cooking, the dough should be kneaded a little more to encourage multiple smaller bubbles instead of one large one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Yeast Naan Dough
An alternative dough uses yeast, with slightly different proportions:
*   2 cups flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:24]</a>
*   1 teaspoon sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:25]</a>
*   ½ teaspoon salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   1 teaspoon dry yeast (can be bloomed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:29]</a>
*   ½ teaspoon baking powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:30]</a>
*   2 tablespoons olive oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:44]</a>
*   1 tablespoon yogurt (too much yogurt with yeast can make it cake-like due to acidity weakening gluten) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:54]</a>
*   About 1 cup milk or water (more needed due to less yogurt moisture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:03:00]</a>

The yeast dough should also be smooth, soft, and only slightly sticky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:04]</a>. Like any yeast bread, it needs to rise for at least an hour at room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:08]</a>. For the tawa-style method, the yeast dough should be kneaded again after rising, divided, and then proofed for at least 15 minutes for a second gas release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Shaping and Topping
To roll out the dough, letting it stick to the counter helps keep it steady and prevents it from snapping back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:55]</a>. Use an outward and off rolling motion to prevent the dough from sticking to the rolling pin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:05:04]</a>. The ideal thickness is slightly less than the thinnest possible roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:09]</a>.

For garlic naan, grating garlic (or using a garlic press) creates thin, stringy pieces that adhere better to the dough than chopped pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:27]</a>. Crushing garlic with salt would yield a similar effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:34]</a>. Fresh chopped cilantro is also a common topping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:36]</a>. Rolling the toppings into the dough is a traditional method that embeds them and makes them part of the bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Cooking on the Stove
The final step before cooking is to wet the bottom side of the dough. This dissolves surface starch, creating a sticky paste layer, similar to how naan would stick to the inside wall of a vertical tandoor oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:06:02]</a>.

1.  **Pan and Heat**: Place the wetted dough, sticky side down, onto a cast iron skillet on medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:08]</a>. A cast iron skillet works well, but a tawa is traditionally used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:20]</a>. Stainless steel pans are generally less effective as the dough tends not to stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:51]</a>. Medium heat (or slightly less) is often suitable, but finding the right temperature for your specific stove requires experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:15]</a>.
2.  **Bottom Cooking**: The method relies on the dough sticking to the pan, so the bottom cannot be checked directly. After 1-2 minutes, bubbles should appear on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:39]</a>. These bubbles are likely mostly steam, though double-acting baking powder can also contribute to aeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:07:12]</a>. The bottom is cooked when the edges look dry, and there's a faint, slightly burned smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:23]</a>.
3.  **Top Cooking (Inversion Method)**: For the characteristic [[Cooking Techniques and Philosophy | cooking techniques]] of tawa-style naan, the pan is inverted and held over the open flame of a gas stove or a high-heat electric coil burner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:42]</a>. The goal is to singe the bubbles while keeping the rest of the surface almost raw, which is key to the restaurant-style naan texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:08:04]</a>. This method won't work on an induction stove because induction doesn't heat the air directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:47]</a>.
4.  **Finishing**: Once cooked, brush generously with melted butter (salted butter can complement slightly under-seasoned dough) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:15]</a>.
5.  **Releasing the Naan**: Releasing the bread from a cast iron skillet can be challenging due to the sides, unlike a tawa which has no sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:22]</a>. Proper seasoning of the cast iron pan is crucial for the naan to stick when desired and release cleanly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:44]</a>.

This method results in naan that tastes baked, not fried, because the bottom cooks on a starch paste layer instead of fat, and the top cooks in very hot dry air, producing crispy bubbles and a baked flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:14]</a>. Attempts to replicate the top cooking with a broiler or kitchen torch are generally less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:25]</a>.

### No-Yeast vs. Yeast Dough in Tawa Style
The no-yeast dough generally performs better for tawa-style naan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:34]</a>. Yeast dough tends to puff up evenly with tiny bubbles, lacking the giant crisp bubbles seen in the no-yeast version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:09]</a>. Yeast dough also may not stick as securely to the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:14]</a>. While the flavor of yeast-fermented naan can be superior, its texture can be inferior, resembling a Western dinner roll rather than having the crisp, bubbly layers of naan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:28]</a>. It's speculated that the intense heat of a tandoor might be necessary to achieve the desired texture with yeast dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Alternative for Induction Stoves or Pan Inversion
For induction stove users, or those hesitant about inverting the pan, the naan can be cooked until done on the bottom and then simply flipped to brown the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:48]</a>. A key aspect of naan is letting the surface remain slightly doughy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:53]</a>. While the texture from this method may not be as good as cooking with hot air, it still tastes baked and not fried because no oil is used for [[nontraditional_cooking_methods | cooking techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:11:02]</a>.

This method requires practice to master, but the results are extraordinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:10]</a>. Remember to give the pan a quick wash and dry after cooking each naan, as residue from the previous naan can interfere with the sticking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:53]</a>.

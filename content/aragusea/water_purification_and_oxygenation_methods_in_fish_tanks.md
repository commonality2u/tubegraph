Maintaining optimal water quality is crucial for any [[setting_up_aquaculture_systems_in_residential_settings | aquaculture system]], especially when keeping a dense mass of fish together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Fish waste, specifically ammonia from their poop, can poison the fish if not properly managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Water Purification

### Water Changes
A primary method for keeping water clean involves regularly changing the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. For systems like Nick Tobler's "eel pit" (a converted home cistern), this involves pumping out dirty water and allowing clean rainwater to fall back in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. If rainwater isn't available, a garden hose can be used for water changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Dirty water is pumped into a large white tub located above the main tank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Biological Filtration
Water purification also relies on biological filtration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Water is passed through a filter drum filled with "bioballs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. These bioballs offer a large surface area where beneficial bacteria grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. As water flows over the bioballs, these bacteria convert harmful ammonia into nitrates, effectively filtering the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Substrate Choice for Gas Exchange
In enclosed environments like a cistern, ample gas exchange is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Using a river rock substrate instead of sand helps prevent pockets of gas from building up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Oxygenation Methods

Oxygenating the water is critical, especially for species with high oxygen needs like sturgeon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Splashing and Airstones
Intentional splashing helps to oxygenate the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Additionally, several airstones are run across the water to further increase oxygen levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Challenges with Plant Filtration
While plants typically help filter water in an aquatic environment, they are not always suitable for all setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In Nick's eel pit, plants are not used because:
*   Sturgeon can get caught in the plants and drown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   In a confined space, especially with cold temperatures, rotting plant matter can produce gases that are harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Species-Specific Needs
Fish like sturgeon require high oxygen levels because they are accustomed to living in fast-moving mountain streams that continuously push oxygen-rich water over their gills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. In still water, these fish would have to swim constantly to breathe, similar to sharks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

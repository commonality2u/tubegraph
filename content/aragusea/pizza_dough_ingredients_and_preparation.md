This article outlines a reliable method for making pan pizza dough, a style popularized in the American Midwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While any [[pizza_dough_preparation | pizza dough]] can be used, this specific recipe offers excellent results for pan pizzas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Ingredients

For one portion of pan pizza dough, the following ingredients are recommended:
*   **Flour:** Approximately 120 grams (about 1 cup) of bread flour, though all-purpose flour also works fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Salt:** About 3 grams (half a teaspoon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Sugar:** Two to three grams (half a teaspoon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Dry Yeast:** One to two grams (half a teaspoon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Olive Oil:** A small amount, about two teaspoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Garlic Powder:** A dash of garlic powder can be added directly into the dough, especially for thick crust pizzas, to enhance flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Milk:** Half a cup of milk is used instead of water, as powdered milk products are known to create nice caramelly notes in the brown surface of the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Scalding the milk is not necessary if it's pasteurized, as no noticeable difference in gluten or rise was observed in tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Dough Preparation

### Mixing the Dough
Combine all dry ingredients first. Then, add the olive oil and milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The dough should be wet and sticky, as this results in a fluffier pan pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Kneading
For a small ball of dough (one pizza portion), an easy method is to knead it in the air between your hands by squishing and grinding it between your palms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This prevents dirtying the counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The dough is sufficiently kneaded when it is smooth and elastic enough to form a thin sheet without tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Form the dough into a smooth ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### First Rise
Place the dough ball back into a bowl, cover it, and let it rise for one to two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The rise time may vary depending on kitchen temperature (e.g., two hours if the kitchen is cold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The dough should double in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Alternatively, for a slower fermentation and [[aging_pizza_dough | aging pizza dough]], the dough can be placed directly into the fridge for a few days after initial mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Preparing the Pan for Second Rise
A non-stick 10-inch Teflon pan with an oven-safe handle is preferred over cast iron for easier handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Apply a small amount of olive oil to the pan (too much can make the pizza taste fried) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Season the oil with dried oregano, basil, chili flakes, and a tiny pinch of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Completely coat the pan with the seasoned oil to create a distinct layer of flavor on the bottom of the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Second Rise in the Pan
Place the dough ball into the oiled pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Instead of stretching it first, mash the dough directly into the pan with your fingertips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This method helps achieve a more even thickness throughout the crust and prevents sauce and cheese from pooling in the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Stretch the dough slightly past the corners of the pan, knowing it will contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Rub a thin layer of oil on top of the dough to prevent it from drying out during the second rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Let the dough rise in the pan for at least half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This second rise is crucial for a lighter and fluffier crust; skipping it can result in a dense and doughy texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

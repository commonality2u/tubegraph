A recommended vessel for making pancake batter is a 1-quart Pyrex measuring jug, especially as the first step involves melting butter in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Key Ingredients and Preparation Order
*   **Melted Butter:** Two tablespoons (about 14 grams) of butter makes pancakes moist and flavorful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Melt it partially in the microwave (around 30 seconds) and then swish it around to melt the rest, ensuring it's not too hot to avoid curdling the egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Sugar:** Two tablespoons (about 25 grams) of sugar should be added next to lower the temperature before the egg is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. While not always traditional, it enhances browning and isn't overly sweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. A fork can be used for mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Egg:** Use one whole egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Vanilla:** A couple of teaspoons of vanilla can be added for flavor, though some might consider it non-traditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Mixing Egg and Butter:** Thoroughly beat the egg into the butter mixture *before* adding milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This ensures the egg is liquefied and the butter is emulsified, preventing the butter from solidifying badly when cold milk is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Milk:** Pour in enough milk to achieve two full cups of total liquid (e.g., 1.5 to 1.75 cups, or 400ml) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Precision isn't crucial for proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Salt:** Add one teaspoon of kosher salt (about 6 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. More salt might be needed if using unsalted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Baking Powder:** Use a heaped tablespoon (about 16 grams, or a tablespoon plus a teaspoon) for fluffy pancakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **All-Purpose Flour:** The amount of flour determines the pancake's thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Start with about 1.5 cups (200 grams) and add more until the desired thickness is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   **Crucial Tip:** Do not overmix the batter once the flour is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It should still have small lumps, as these will cook out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Overmixing results in tough pancakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Resting the Batter:** Allow the batter to sit for a few minutes to let the flour hydrate, which improves cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Preheating the cooking surface *after* mixing the batter ensures a rest period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. If the batter thickens too much after resting, loosen it with a little more milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Pan Selection and Heat Management
*   **Pan Types:**
    *   **10-inch Nonstick Skillet:** A widely available and easy option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   **Stainless Steel Pan:** Possible to use, but may require extra butter to prevent sticking, and the first side might cook darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
    *   **Flat Square Griddle Pan:** Ideal for cooking multiple small pancakes efficiently, especially for families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Its short rim makes spatula use easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
    *   **Electric Tabletop Griddle:** Recommended for cooking many pancakes simultaneously, ensuring they are ready at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Finding the Right Heat:** The trickiest part of making pancakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. A setting just below medium is often perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   **Water Flick Test:** Flick water into the pan. If it sits, it's too cold. If it sizzles out, it's too hot. If it dances, it's perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   **Butter Test:** Rub a stick of butter on the pan. Butter has water that fizzes at boiling point and milk solids that brown. The ideal time to add batter is when the butter is just barely starting to brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Pouring and Flipping Pancakes
*   **Pouring Batter:**
    *   **Round Pan:** A round pan acts as a mold, allowing batter to spread naturally into a tidy circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Avoid spreading it with a utensil, as this creates an ugly surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   **Measuring Cup:** Using a small measuring cup for scooping helps create almost perfectly round pancakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   **Batter Dispensers:** Pancake batter dispensers with a valve at the bottom can yield perfectly round pancakes, but only work well with thinner batters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **When to Flip:**
    *   **Bubbles:** The best sign is bubbles popping on the surface, indicating the pancake is cooking through. Bubbles appear at the edge first, then move to the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   **Matte Edges:** For small pancakes, seeing the edges turn to a matte finish is another good indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   The first side must be solid enough to flip without falling apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **How to Flip:**
    *   **Spatula:** A normal home kitchen spatula might be too small for a 10-inch pancake, risking bending or breaking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This requires the bottom side to be very cooked, which can lead to burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   **Air Flip:** Many prefer to air flip large pancakes before they are solid enough for a spatula, preventing them from becoming too dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Requires confidence and force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   **Small Pancakes:** Much easier to cook and flip, often just by looking for bubbles around the edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. No scary air flips or giant spatulas needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    *   **Overlapping:** If pancakes overlap during cooking, small patches of raw batter might appear on the cooked surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This raw batter will usually steam cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. For extra assurance, flip them back onto their first side briefly before removing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Achieving Desired Doneness and Color
*   **Checking Doneness:** For thick, fluffy pancakes, the center can still be raw even if the outside looks done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Cook until outwardly done, then wait another minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Resting:** Like steak, allow large, thick pancakes to rest on a cooling rack for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Carryover cooking will finish the interior and prevent dryness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This also prevents sogginess by allowing steam to escape, rather than condensing on a plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Keeping Warm:** While cooking multiple pancakes, you can place the cooling rack in a warm oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Even Color:** Brushing excess butter off the pan with a towel can help achieve a more even color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The second batch often has a nicer, even bronze color due to fat distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Batter Variations and Additions
*   **Half Batch:** When making a half batch, use only the egg yolk and discard the white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Straight yolk can make the pancakes even better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Decorative Additions:** Simple decorative additions, like food coloring for green pancakes, are a great way to learn basic color theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Buttermilk Pancakes:**
    *   Replace regular milk with real buttermilk (a milky yogurt consistency) for a distinct lactic acid flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
    *   When using buttermilk, do not use baking powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Buttermilk provides the necessary acid, so only baking soda (sodium bicarb) is needed to balance it and create bubbles, typically one teaspoon max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## Serving
*   Pancakes can be served with powdered sugar using a shaker cup or a sieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Fake maple syrup is also a popular topping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Fennel in Tomato Soup

Fennel bulb can be a flavorful addition to tomato soup, providing a "nice subtle licorice flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Preparation and Use
*   If you plan to strain the soup, you can chop up the stalks and add them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   However, if you prefer a chunky style soup, it's recommended to "only us[e] the bulb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> because the stalks contain small fibers that can get caught in the throat if not strained out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   The fennel bulb should be shaved finely so it cooks at the same rate as the onion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   Add the fennel and onion to butter (or oil) in a pan on medium heat to give them a head start without browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Garnish
*   Beyond incorporating it into the soup base, you can also chop up the fronds from the fennel bulb and scatter them on top as a garnish for added freshness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Chili Oil for Tomato Soup

Chili oil serves as an excellent garnish to counteract the "homogeneity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> of pureed soups, creating "nice variety as you eat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a> by floating at the top and allowing you to dose it onto each spoonful as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Making Chili Oil
While store-bought chili oil is an option, it's "easy to make" at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
1.  **Ingredients**: Combine dried chili flakes and olive oil in a small pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The amount of chili flakes can be increased for more spice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
2.  **Flavor and Temperature Control**: Add a crushed garlic clove. The garlic contributes flavor, and the water content in the garlic acts as a thermometer. When it's "just barely sizzling," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> it indicates sufficient heat to infuse the oil without burning flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
3.  **Infusion**: Allow the mixture to infuse on low heat while the soup cooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

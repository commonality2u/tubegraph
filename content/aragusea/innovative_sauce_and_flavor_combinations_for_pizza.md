## Standard Pizza Sauce

A typical pizza sauce can be made using a brand of strongly flavored ground tomatoes, a little olive oil, spices, and potentially a pinch of sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25">[04:25]</a>.

## Herb Additions

Fresh herbs can be incorporated directly into the sauce layer for added flavor and visual appeal. This includes whole parsley leaves or half basil leaves, which can be semi-covered by cheese to allow them to poke through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39">[02:39]</a>.

## Orange and Tomato Sauce

An innovative sauce involves the combination of orange and tomato, which is described as an "awesome" flavor pairing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07">[05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08">[06:08]</a>.

### Preparation of Orange and Tomato Sauce

To create this sauce, olive oil is heated in a pan, and roughly chopped shallots are saut√©ed until they begin to brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30">[05:30]</a>. High-quality whole canned plum tomatoes are then added and mashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36">[05:36]</a>. The mixture is stirred until it develops color, and the pan starts to go dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43">[05:43]</a>. The pan is then deglazed with the juice of an orange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51">[05:51]</a>. The cooked mixture, along with a few additional nearly raw tomatoes straight from the can (to prevent the sauce from tasting "too cooked"), is pureed until smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58">[05:58]</a>. Since the sauce is naturally a little sweet, it can be balanced with some chili <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10">[06:10]</a>.

## Gremolata as a Topping

Gremolata, traditionally made with lemon zest, can be innovatively adapted using orange zest instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15">[05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18">[05:18]</a>. This mixture, consisting of garlic cloves, orange zest, and parsley, is chopped together to merge the flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07">[05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>. Gremolata serves as a fresh and flavorful [[toppings_and_seasoning_for_pan_pizza | pizza topping]] once the pizza is cooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18">[05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40">[07:40]</a>.

## Pancetta Integration

Pancetta or similar bacon-like products can be used as a flavor component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22">[06:22]</a>.
Slowly rendered pancetta fat can be used to fry the bread, and the browned pancetta chunks can be embedded directly into the bread base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26">[06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01">[07:01]</a>. Remaining pancetta can be placed among the cheese before baking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24">[07:24]</a>.

Panko is a distinct type of breadcrumb that originated in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While sharing the general purpose of breadcrumbs, panko exhibits unique characteristics and advantages over traditional Western-style breadcrumbs.

### Key Differences in Properties and Structure

Even when ground into a fine powder, panko consistently fries up significantly crispier than other breadcrumbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This superior crispiness stems from fundamental differences at the microscopic level, primarily a result of its peculiar baking method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Traditional breadcrumbs are typically made from normal bread that has been staled, dried, toasted, and then ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. On a microscopic level, these crumbs are not as airy as panko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

*   **Crispiness vs. Crunchiness**: Panko is described as "crispy," which implies it is both brittle and airy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, formed by thin sheets of brittle material interspersed with small voids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Airiness and Absorbency**: Panko's light, airy crumb structure makes it highly absorbent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. In a simple experiment, 20 grams of panko absorbed more water than 20 grams of Western breadcrumbs, turning into a less viscous mixture when agitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Oil Drainage**: Despite its absorbency during frying, panko effectively drains oil when pulled from the fryer, resulting in a less greasy, less heavy, and less soggy product that stays crispier for longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This is partly attributed to the wide, open hollows in the panko structure allowing oil to drain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The dryness of panko also plays a role in preventing oil absorption during the cooling phase, where water vapor condenses and sucks in oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Flavor and Color**: Because the bread for panko has no crust, it has a totally uniform color and a more neutral flavor, making it a "blank canvas" for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Manufacturing Process and Its Impact

The fundamental difference lies in how the bread for panko is baked.

*   **Electrical Current Baking**: Panko bread is baked using electrical current, conducting electricity through the dough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The dough's resistance to this current generates heat, effectively steam-cooking the bread from the inside out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This contrasts with conventional bread baking, which heats the loaf from the outside in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Lack of Crust**: A direct result of this internal baking is the total absence of a crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. When normal bread bakes, the outer surface dries out, gets hot, and caramelizes, forming a crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Since panko bread lacks this crust, it also lacks the associated structure, making it very delicate to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Interior Structure**: Baking with electrical current also profoundly impacts the interior structure of the loaf, leading to an extremely light, airy crumb that becomes super crispy when dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Crumb Shape**: The traditional panko shape is long, pointy, or sliver-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This specific shape is achieved not by the grinder but by how well the bread was baked and fermented, allowing gluten fibers to lengthen and connect naturally, causing the bread to flake into slivers when ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Some panko can also be round in shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Panko's unique properties make it highly versatile in the kitchen.

*   **Binding Agent**: Its high absorbency allows it to be used as a binder in mixtures like meatballs or salmon burgers, enabling chefs to bind ingredients and make them moldable while adding less bread to the overall mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Crispy Breading**: Panko is ideal for creating crispy coatings on fried foods, such as breaded shrimp or [[breading_techniques_and_variations_for_schnitzel | chicken katsu]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Its ability to stay crispier for longer even when facing challenges like lower oil temperatures or waiting periods makes it a "foolproof crispy" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Can You Make Panko at Home?

Some home cooks attempt to make panko by cutting crusts off processed white sandwich loaves, then shredding and drying the bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. There are also claims that some panko producers microwave their loaves instead of using electrical shocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, which theoretically would also cook the bread from the inside out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. However, achieving professional-quality panko at home is likely very challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

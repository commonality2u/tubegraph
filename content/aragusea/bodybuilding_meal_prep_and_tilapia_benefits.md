From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

This article outlines a personal approach to making rapid course corrections to body composition, focusing on meal preparation and exercise. The author is not a medical or nutritional professional and advises consulting one before making significant body changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This approach is based on personal experience with body composition changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Exercise Regimen

The author's exercise regimen primarily involves strength training, performed in a home gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This typically includes simple exercises like squats, pull-ups, and pressing movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Strength training has been found more effective than cardio for personal weight reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Bodybuilding Style Meal Prep: Tilapia and Cauliflower Rice

Muscle growth requires protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. For this purpose, tilapia is chosen, especially for [[personal_goals_and_motivations_in_cooking_and_lifting | bodybuilding-style meal prep]] where large quantities of the same food are consumed for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Why Tilapia?

Tilapia is selected for three main reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:
1.  **Affordability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
2.  **Low Mercury Content**: Unlike many other fish, tilapia is not typically full of mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
3.  **Sustainability**: It is considered relatively sustainable as seafood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

For sustainability information on seafood, a useful resource is SeafoodWatch.org, a service of the Monterey Bay Aquarium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The sustainability grade of a fish can vary based on its origin; for instance, tilapia farmed in Mexico receives a middle-grade rating, while that from Ecuador or Peru is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Cooking Tilapia

Most seafood for this meal prep is bought frozen solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Modern flash-freezing processes cause virtually no quality degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The fish is cooked directly from frozen without thawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Preparation**: Add a little olive oil, salt, and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Method**: Bake in an oven at 350°F (180°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Doneness**: The fish is done when it's opaque and flakes easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
The results taste surprisingly good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Carbohydrate Strategy: "Virtually Zero Carb"

While bodybuilders often pair lean protein with carbohydrates like rice to fuel workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, the author aims for a "virtually zero carb" approach for planned meals when trying to slim down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This philosophy acknowledges that carbohydrates will inevitably be consumed through social eating or occasional treats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. By keeping planned meals low-carb, the overall diet averages out to a moderate carb intake, which helps with weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Instead of rice, cauliflower rice is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Preparation (from scratch)**: Cut cauliflower into florets, then process a few at a time in a food processor until they form small grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Cooking**: Sauté with olive oil and salt for about five minutes; the high water content causes it to steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Alternative**: The author often buys frozen bags of cauliflower rice due to the mess and odor of preparing it from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
[[nutritional_benefits_of_cooking_food | Cooking]] is essential for both palatability and digestibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Meal Storage and Consumption

After cooking, the meal is allowed to cool, then lidded and stored in the fridge, providing protein meals for almost a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The author eats whenever hungry, often straight from the pot without reheating, and sometimes adds a squeeze of lemon for freshness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Supplements

*   **Protein Shakes**: Whey protein isolate is used, sometimes mixed with creatine powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   Creatine is considered arguably the only legal strength training supplement "worth a damn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
    *   A 2018 study indicated disturbing amounts of heavy metals, arsenic, and BPA in some popular protein powders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. When consuming a food repeatedly, it's important to choose reputable brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This highlights the [[role_of_science_and_studies_in_cooking_and_bodybuilding | role of science and studies]] in dietary choices.
*   **Other Supplements**: A multivitamin and fish oil supplement are also taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Vegetable Soup for Reduction

A simple vegetable soup is another preferred meal for reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Base**: Starts with onions (e.g., Vidalia onions from Georgia) and a large carrot, boiled in water (not stock) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Additions**: Tomatoes (skins included for nutrition and pectin to thicken broth), cabbage or kale, fresh chopped garlic, salt, pepper, a dash of vinegar, and frozen peas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Finishing**: Raw olive oil in the bowl aids digestion of fat-soluble vitamins and adds flavor, along with fresh herbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Managing Cruciferous Vegetables

When introducing many cruciferous vegetables (like cabbage and cauliflower) into the diet, it's advised to consider a supplement containing the enzyme alpha-galactosidase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This enzyme helps break down large sugars in these vegetables, preventing them from being metabolized by gut microorganisms and causing gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Additional Tips for Weight Management

*   **Oral Hygiene**: Brushing and flossing frequently can reduce cravings for sweets by eliminating bad tastes in the mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Getting Started**: The second hardest part of losing weight (after keeping it off) is getting started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Pushing through the initial pain of the first week or so makes the process much easier, leading to visible results and increased motivation to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

A classic grilled cheese sandwich, often paired with [[homemade_tomato_soup_ingredients_and_preparation | homemade tomato soup]], is considered one of the best cold-weather meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Ingredients

A classic grilled cheese typically features three core ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:
*   Fluffy, pre-sliced, factory-made white sandwich bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   American cheese, also known internationally as processed cheese or cheese slices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This cheese is made from ground and reconstituted cheddar and/or Colby cheese with vegetable oil and emulsifying salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Processed cheese slices melt exceptionally smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   A generous amount of softened butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

A "secret" fourth ingredient can be a light dusting of garlic powder, which adds depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Alternative Ingredients
For a more sophisticated grilled cheese, rye bread can be used, particularly as it pairs well with tomato soup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Real cheeses like sharp cheddar and Swiss can also be substituted for American cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Butter Preparation

Butter should be softened, either at room temperature or by microwaving cold butter on low power for 10-20 seconds, flipping it, and giving it another quick hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The butter should be easily slathered but not melted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. An "obscene amount" of butter is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

When the buttered bread hits the pan, the outer layer of butter toasts the bread to a brown and crispy finish, while the inner layer melts into the bread's interior, remaining sweet without browning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Applying butter directly to the bread, rather than melting it in the pan, ensures a fresh, sweet butter taste inside the bread in addition to the brown crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Cooking Process

1.  **Pan and Heat**: Any pan is suitable, but a nonstick pan is foolproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Cook on medium heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  **Assembly**: Place the first buttered slice of bread butter-side down in the pan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Add two slices of American cheese, optionally dusted with garlic powder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Place the second buttered slice of bread butter-side up on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
3.  **Crucial Step - Cover**: Cover the pan with a lid or foil. This doesn't need to be airtight, but retaining some steam helps melt the cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
4.  **Browning and Flipping**: Processed sandwich breads are high in sugar and can burn quickly, so check often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The first side should be cooked until quite dark and crispy, just on the edge of burning, before flipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
5.  **Melting Real Cheese**: If using real cheese, add a little water to the pan halfway through cooking and seal with a tight lid. The steam will help the cheese become stretchy and "pull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
6.  **Final Touches**: After the second side is browned and the cheese is melted, give it a few final flips uncovered to get both sides hot and crispy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## [[Difference between butter and mayonnaise in grilled cheese sandwiches | Mayonnaise vs. Butter]]

Many people prefer mayonnaise over softened butter for slathering on grilled cheese bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55">[01:55]</a>.

*   **Convenience**: Mayonnaise is more convenient as it does not need to be warmed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01">[02:01]</a>.
*   **Crispiness**: Mayonnaise tends to result in a crispier crust, possibly due to its lower water content compared to butter or the egg protein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07">[02:07]</a>.
*   **Flavor**: The flavor of mayonnaise is considered inferior to butter. When grilled until just golden, it can taste like nothing, but when grilled until dark, it can develop an "awful fishy flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16">[02:16]</a>.
*   **Recommendation**: While some love the mayonnaise method, if trying it, it's suggested not to cook it as brown as one might with the butter version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50">[02:50]</a>.

## Serving Suggestion

Grilled cheese sandwiches should always be cut into triangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33">[03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50">[08:50]</a>. This shape is ideal for dipping into a bowl of [[homemade_tomato_soup_ingredients_and_preparation | homemade tomato soup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47">[08:47]</a>.

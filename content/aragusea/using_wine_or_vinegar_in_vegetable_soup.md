Adding wine or vinegar to vegetable soup can significantly enhance its flavor profile and provide additional benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Incorporating White Wine

White wine can be a valuable addition to vegetable soup, especially if avoiding animal broths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

*   **Flavor Contribution**: White wine adds fruity sweetness and acidity to the broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Flavor Extraction**: It helps extract alcohol-soluble flavors from the vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Alternative to Animal Broth**: Using white wine tastes great and can compensate for the absence of animal broth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Using Vinegar as an Alternative

For those who prefer not to use alcohol, white balsamic vinegar can serve as an excellent substitute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

*   **Quantity**: A much smaller quantity, just a splash, is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Timing**: It should be added at the very end of cooking, to taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Types of Vinegar**: Information on [[Different Types of Vinegar and Aging | different types of vinegar]] and their [[Cultural and Historical Uses of Vinegar | cultural and historical uses]] can provide further context for culinary applications.

From: [[aragusea]] <br/> 

Turkey demi-glace is a concentrated sauce derived from turkey bones and trimmings, offering a deeply flavorful alternative to traditional [[making_turkey_gravy | gravy]] for holiday meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Its preparation can be done in advance, easing the workload on the day of a big holiday feast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Preparation Timeline

It is suggested to start the process two days before the feast, although it can be started the day before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Ingredients for Demi-Glace

*   Turkey bones (from [[deboning_a_turkey | deboned turkey]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>

*   Whole peppercorns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>
*   Bay leaves (optional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>
*   Filtered water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   Unflavored gelatin packet (optional, for increased volume and texture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>
*   White wine (optional, for brightness and floral notes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>
*   Butter (optional, for finishing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>

## Step-by-Step Process

### Roasting the Bones and Aromatics
1.  Place all bones, neck, skin, trimmings, and halved onions in a roasting tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
2.  Roast in an oven at 400°F (200°C) for approximately 30 minutes to develop brown flavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
3.  After about 30 minutes, add a little tomato paste and flip the pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Tomato paste boosts umami and darkens color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
4.  Continue roasting, ensuring nothing burns, as burnt bits can concentrate bad flavors in the demi-glace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The roasting process takes about an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Simmering the Stock (Day 1)
1.  Transfer the roasted bones and other ingredients into a large stock pot or continue simmering them directly in the roasting tray if it's large enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
2.  Add cold filtered water, ensuring everything is submerged as it cooks down and softens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Using cold water is recommended to dissolve albumin protein from meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
3.  For an umami boost, consider adding a handful of dried porcini mushrooms. Whole peppercorns and bay leaves can also be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
4.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a bare simmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Cover the pot, for example, with foil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
5.  Simmer for several hours. To extract all collagen into gelatin, this might take around 16 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Ensure the water doesn't evaporate completely, especially if simmering overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Top off the water as needed to maintain submersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
6.  The simmering process may produce intense smells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
7.  A good sign that all possible extraction has occurred is when a bone breaks very easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Finishing the Demi-Glace (Day 2)
1.  Fish out most of the solids from the stock. Pour any liquid from the removed solids back into the pot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
2.  Bring the stock to a boil and reduce it by about a third to concentrate it and make it easier to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
3.  (Optional) If you want more sauce volume, dissolve a packet of unflavored gelatin into the boiling stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
4.  Pass the reduced stock through a sieve to remove any remaining small solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
5.  Cool the stock down quickly. This can be done by nesting the bowl of stock in a larger bowl filled with ice water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Stir occasionally to facilitate heat transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Rapid cooling is important due to the high protein, low sodium, low acid nature of the solution, which can be hospitable to microbes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
6.  Cover the cooled stock (fat absorbs smells) and refrigerate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. It can also be placed in the freezer for quicker solidification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### Separating Fat and Concentrating
1.  Once chilled, the fat will have surfaced. While turkey fat may not solidify into a firm puck like beef fat, it's still relatively easy to scrape off the top because the stock underneath forms a firm block of jello <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
2.  Transfer the "meaty jello" into your widest pan. Bring it to a boil and continue concentrating it until it becomes syrupy, forming a meat glaze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This high concentration means it cannot hold fat, which is why fat removal was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
3.  Stir constantly once it starts to get very syrupy to prevent sticking and burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
4.  (Optional) Add a glass of white wine for brightness and floral notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. If adding wine, stir thoroughly or cook at a lower temperature for a longer time to avoid burning the sugars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
5.  Assess thickness: a gelatin-thickened sauce will be thicker at eating temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
6.  Season with salt to taste. The demi-glace has no added salt until this stage, other than natural animal salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
7.  Scrape the finished demi-glace into a bowl, chill, and reheat when ready to serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Serving the Demi-Glace
*   To increase the sauce volume for a large meal, slowly stir in a bunch of butter at a very low heat without bubbling. This will emulsify and make the flavor more delicious, with a warmer, fluffier texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   Re-season after adding butter, especially if using unsalted butter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   Demi-glace is far more intense than gravy, so less is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Inform guests to use it sparingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   It is nice that the crispy skin of the turkey does not need to be wetted down with sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

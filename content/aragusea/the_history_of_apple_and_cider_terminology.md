## Divergent Meanings of "Cider"

In most English-speaking countries, "cider" refers to a delightful, relatively low-alcohol, fizzy drink made from apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, in the United States, "cider" typically means a non-alcoholic, still, and often cloudy apple product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The fizzy, alcoholic version is referred to as "hard cider" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, while clear, filtered apple juice is simply called "apple juice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

This distinction is unique to American English, with no other Anglophone countries differentiating these three products in the same way, save for some confused Canadians influenced by the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In the UK, for instance, both clear and cloudy non-alcoholic apple juice are referred to as "apple juice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

The term "hard cider" emerged in the US to distinguish the alcoholic product from "sweet" or "soft" cider, which had become the common term for unfermented apple juice after Prohibition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The convention of calling alcoholic beverages "hard" and non-alcoholic ones "soft" is a unique feature of American English, with examples dating back to the colonial period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This may have descended from an older British English feature describing harsh-tasting drinks as "hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, as alcohol itself has a harsh taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Historical Evolution of "Apple"

Historically, the word "apple" has not always exclusively meant the fruit we know today. In English and many Indo-European languages, "apple" was once a generic term for virtually any fruit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. In this broader sense, "fruit" referred to any edible bulbous growth on a plant, not just those strictly meeting botanical definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This linguistic evolution is why the French still use their word for apple, "pomme," to describe potatoes, calling them "pomme de terre" (apple of the earth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Due to French being regarded as high-class in Anglophone society, English-speaking chefs sometimes list mashed potatoes as "pomme puree" on menus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. English continued to use "apple" to describe any fruit as recently as the 17th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Despite this broader usage, *Malus domestica* (the apple fruit) has been popular in Britain since at least Roman times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The wild ancestor of the apple is native to Central Asia, with "alma" being the Kazakh word for apple, giving Almaty its name ("Appletown") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The Romans spread domesticated varieties throughout their empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Subsequent Germanic settlers and French-speaking Normans (after their 1066 conquest) brought even more varieties to England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Apples were referred to as "pomme" in English well into the modern period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Britain's climate was ideal for apple trees, leading to the cultivation of both "dessert apples" (for eating) and "cider apples" (for juicing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Etymology and Historical Use of "Cider"

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term "cider" and its etymological ancestors have consistently referred to some form of alcoholic beverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Its lineage traces back to the Hebrew word *shekhar*, meaning "strong drink" or "intoxicant" (Leviticus 10:8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Latin Christians translated this to *sikara*, which evolved into *cedro* in Italian, *sidra* in Spanish, and an Old French term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The Normans brought this word to England, where it became "cider" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

The OED's first record of "apple juice" is from early modern English, suggesting no specific Middle English term for the non-alcoholic product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This is likely because apple juice naturally tends to ferment and become alcoholic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Apples are naturally covered in yeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Unwashed, smashed apple juice, if not boiled or treated, will likely become a weak alcoholic beverage within a couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Historically, people allowed this natural fermentation to occur, making the drink safer by controlling bad bacteria with alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This resulted in a nutritious, tasty drink that was often safer than the local water supply and had a low enough alcohol content to be given to children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Until very recently, "cider" almost exclusively meant an apple-based alcoholic drink, akin to apple beer or wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Modern commercial ciders are typically carbonated and range from 5-10% alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### The [[the_process_of_making_alcoholic_and_nonalcoholic_cider | Process of Making Cider]]

Homemade cider, such as the kind described from central Pennsylvania, often involved simply pressing late-season apples into unfiltered, unpasteurized juice and allowing it to ferment naturally at room temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The build-up of CO2 pressure would indicate fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. While this produced a low-alcohol sparkly cider, it also carried risks of bacterial propagation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Modern methods, demonstrated by Dr. Nathan Duncan, involve using pasteurized apple juice (which has had microorganisms killed) and adding specific yeast strains, such as British ale yeast, to control the fermentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Fermented apple juice clarifies over time, with yeast and pulp forming sediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Alcoholic ciders are often made with apples that are not ideal for eating, as their harsh or astringent qualities (due to high tannin content) contribute depth and body to the fermented product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Cider in Colonial America and its Decline

When English colonists arrived in New England, they found a climate highly suitable for orchards and planted both dessert and cider apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The importance of cider is evidenced by the Pilgrims bracing a broken beam on the Mayflower with an iron screw from their cider press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Alcoholic apple cider became a staple of Anglo-American colonial homesteads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Colonists gave it to their children, used it to make [[history_and_origin_of_vinegar | apple cider vinegar]] (essential for food preservation and cleaning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, and converted it into stronger drinks like applejack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

Applejack was produced by "freeze distillation," where fermented cider was left outside in freezing New England winters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Since water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius and ethanol requires liquid nitrogen temperatures to freeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, the unfrozen liquid would have a higher concentration of ethanol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This high-alcohol "hooch" was popular in New England and parts of the Midwest where New Englanders resettled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

However, the temperance movement, most fervent among the descendants of English Puritans, eventually led to [[impact_of_prohibition_on_the_cider_industry_in_the_us | Prohibition]] in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. While the beer industry managed to survive Prohibition, the hard cider industry was completely wiped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. From its ashes emerged "sweet cider" (unfermented apple juice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

The industrialization of America's food system then introduced highly filtered and refined cider, marketed as "apple juice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. To distinguish it, the cloudy, unfermented product became known as "cider" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. When alcoholic cider experienced a commercial resurgence in the US, it was termed "hard cider" to differentiate it from the widely established "cider" (non-alcoholic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
